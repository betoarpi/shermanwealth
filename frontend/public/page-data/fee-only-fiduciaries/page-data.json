That’s why we are a fee-only, fiduciary RIA.</p>\n<p>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-size: 19px; font-family: roboto; color: #4f4f4f;\"><strong>FEE-ONLY</strong> means that we are paid exclusively by our clients, so we are conflict-free. We do not get commissions from the investments or products we recommend. We do not get bonuses based on how many clients we get to invest in company products. We are paid a monthly fee by our clients, who retain us because we are making their money work for them, and them alone.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-size: 19px; font-family: roboto; color: #4f4f4f;\"><strong>FIDUCIARY</strong> means that we have taken a pledge to always act in our clients’ best interests by only recommending the investments, products, and instruments that are the most advantageous for them. Non-fiduciaries are only required to make recommendations that are “suitable” for their clients. As Fiduciaries, we make recommendations that are the <em>most</em> suitable for our clients.</li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 19px; font-family: roboto; color: #4f4f4f;\"><strong>RIA </strong>means that we are a Registered Investment Advisory, unaffiliated with any companies or products that are potential conflicts-of-interest, and sworn to the Fiduciary Standard. We work for you, and no one else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent <em>your</em> best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you.  A fee-only financial advisor ensures you get the best personalized service that fits your individual needs.</p>\n<p>That’s why you should work with a conflict-free, fee-only fiduciary advisor: we only work for you!</p>\n<p><strong>Other articles on fee-only fiduciary financial advising:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">Is Your Retirement Advisor a Fiduciary?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">6 Questions to Ask A Financial Advisor</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\">Do You Need to Change Your Financial Advisor?</a></p>\n<div class=\"column one post-header\"></div>\n<p>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]</p>\n","template":"","acf":null,"yoast_meta":[{"name":"robots","property":null},{"name":null,"property":"og:locale"},{"name":null,"property":"og:type"},{"name":null,"property":"og:title"},{"name":null,"property":"og:description"},{"name":null,"property":"og:url"},{"name":null,"property":"og:site_name"},{"name":"twitter:card","property":null},{"name":"twitter:description","property":null},{"name":"twitter:title","property":null}],"yoast_title":"Fee-Only Fiduciary Financial Advisor - Sherman Wealth Management | Financial Planning in MD and DC Metro"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"fee-only-fiduciaries","template":""}}}
