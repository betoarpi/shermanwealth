Finding and adjusting for the right balance between return and risk in your investment portfolio’s asset allocation helps you pursue your short-term and long-term financial goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Custom Investment Portfolio is a carefully selected collection of assets that is specifically designed to reflect your risk tolerance in a specific time frame to optimize your investment goals. That financial portfolio is built by selecting combinations of assets that exhibit different risk/reward characteristics. The three main asset classes or securities are stocks, bonds and money market instruments. Real Estate and Commodities may also be an appropriate asset for some investment portfolios.</span></p>\n<p><b>Why is Custom Investment Portfolio Construction Important?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to spread your financial assets across multiple asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, cash and non-traditional assets. It is also critical to periodically rebalance your asset allocation to capitalize on changing markets, economic conditions, and your own life changes to help protect your assets.</span></p>\n<p><b>What Are the Benefits of Working With Sherman Wealth?</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A willingness to invest the time to select the right portfolio balance.
