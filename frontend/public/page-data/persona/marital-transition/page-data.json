Financial planners are also a great source for people who have no clue as to what is going on with their finances and are don’t have a plan in general. Planners give unbiased, professionally-trained advice. Further, they can provide tips and strategies (especially when it comes to taxes!) that you might not have known about. Each financial advisor has their own style and core beliefs, so please do your due diligence to determine which one is the best fit for the specific needs of you and your family.

However, this can be a very confusing process. Why? Because there are a plethora of different theories and formulas. Obviously, one of the more important questions to ask yourself is “How much money I want to spend?”.
