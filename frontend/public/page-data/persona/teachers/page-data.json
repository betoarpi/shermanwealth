We’ve been in your shoes and know the milestones you’re facing, whether it’s starting a family or paying off student debt. When you choose to work with us, we begin the process by listening to your needs and goals – both short- and long-term – then offer a specialized financial blueprint that helps lay the foundation for your personal and professional success.</p>\n","work_with_us":"<p>What we see with younger investors is they aren’t just saving and investing for retirement, which has been the primary focus of previous generations. They realize they need to save for longer-term goals, but they also save and invest to fund near-term passions like travel and life experiences. This focus on nurturing themselves as they age might be is just one explanation as to why our millennial clients are so engaged with their money.</p>\n","content_blocks_persona":[{"__typename":"WordPressAcf_intro_section","intro_text":"You know you want to invest.

Further, only 26% of people start investing before the age of 25. But the math is simple: it’s cheaper (and easier, as we know) to save for retirement in your 20s versus your 30s or even later in life. If you start investing with just $3,600 per year at age 22, assuming an 8% average annual return, you’d theoretically have $1 million by the time you turned 62. But if you wait until age 32 (just 10 years later), you’ll have to save $8,200 per year to reach that same goal of $1 million at age 62.​</p>\n<p>In fact, here’s how much you would have to save each year, based on your age, to reach $1 million at 62:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-130 size-full\" src=\"https://shermandev.cydoniacloudserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/age-graph.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://shermandev.cydoniacloudserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/age-graph.jpg 447w, https://shermandev.cydoniacloudserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/age-graph-300x213.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Plan, plan, plan…</strong></h3>\n<p>Planning ahead should be a high priority, and we cannot stress this enough. It is never too early to start thinking about your future, especially if you have a family and children. By making wealth and financial management a priority early in your life, you will give yourself a greater opportunity to meet your long-term financial goals. Effective wealth management, based on a customized, strategic financial plan, can help you make the most of your assets and ensure your financial objectives are met. Whether through effective tax planning or sound investment, you need to make sure your money keeps working for you.</p>\n","id":"8604304f-8451-5135-9cdb-b575aa6d65d41content_blocksWordPressAcf_regular_content"},{"__typename":"WordPressAcf_featured_content","featured_content_block":[{"content":"<h4><strong>Education is key…</strong></h4>\n<p>The first key to investing is not only understanding what you own but <em>why</em> you own it. It is, therefore, the job of the financial planner to provide assistance to help improve their client’s education. We see ourselves as a funnel. We listen, we observe and take in as much information as possible, we then use this information to make things easier for the client to understand.

Without a financial plan, you are less likely to set realistic goals and remain on track to meet them. By failing to identify your financial strengths and weaknesses, you are unlikely to build on the former and address the latter. Nor are you likely to put a plan into action and monitor its progress.
