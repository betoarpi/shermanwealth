You may be building your career, or your own company, traveling, buying a first home, or starting a family, and all of that takes resources.</p>\n<p>But a strategic financial plan, even a simple one, is a smart way to cover both bases. It lets you make sure you have enough to live the way you want to live <em>now</em> while allowing your money to grow for the future.</p>\n<p>You already know the math: the earlier you start saving, the more wealth you’ll build through the power of compounded interest (interest on the interest you earn.) If you start investing just $3,600 a year when you’re 22, you could have $1 million dollars by the time you turn 62 (assuming an 8% average annual return). If you wait until you’re 32, you’ll have to save $8,200 per year to reach that same goal by 62.​</p>\n<p>By making financial management a priority, you not only take control of your finances now, but you’re also taking control of your future too.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ready to take control of your life with Financial Planning?</h4>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Want to learn about our smart, strategic approach to investing?</h4>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Curious about how tax planning can have an impact on your savings?</h4>\n","wordpress_id":128,"acf":{"persona_description":"<p>You’re a millennial just starting out along your path.

They realize they need to save for longer-term goals, but they also save and invest to fund near-term passions like travel and life experiences. This focus on nurturing themselves as they age might be is just one explanation as to why our millennial clients are so engaged with their money.</p>\n"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"young-professionals"}}}
