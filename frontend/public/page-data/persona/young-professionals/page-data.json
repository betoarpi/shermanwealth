You have a list of goals, but you’re not sure where to start.</p>\n<p>We’re passionate about working with young professionals like you. We’ve been in your shoes and know the milestones you’re facing, whether it’s starting a family or paying off student debt. When you choose to work with us, we begin the process by listening to your needs and goals – both short- and long-term – then offer a specialized financial blueprint that helps lay the foundation for your personal and professional success.</p>\n","work_with_us":"<p>What we see with younger investors is they aren’t just saving and investing for retirement, which has been the primary focus of previous generations. They realize they need to save for longer-term goals, but they also save and invest to fund near-term passions like travel and life experiences. This focus on nurturing themselves as they age might be is just one explanation as to why our millennial clients are so engaged with their money.</p>\n","content_blocks_persona":[{"__typename":"WordPressAcf_intro_section","intro_text":"“It’s time to get serious about my finances to build a great future”","id":"4806e54b-0d01-5dc3-97f7-66aacf9475140content_blocksWordPressAcf_intro_section"},{"__typename":"WordPressAcf_regular_content","content_text":"<p>When you’re young, it’s tempting to invest in your current life, rather than a distant future. You may be building your career, or your own company, traveling, buying a first home, or starting a family, and all of that takes resources.</p>\n<p>But a strategic financial plan, even a simple one, is a smart way to cover both bases. It lets you make sure you have enough to live the way you want to live <em>now</em> while allowing your money to grow for the future.</p>\n<p>You already know the math: the earlier you start saving, the more wealth you’ll build through the power of compounded interest (interest on the interest you earn.) If you start investing just $3,600 a year when you’re 22, you could have $1 million dollars by the time you turn 62 (assuming an 8% average annual return). If you wait until you’re 32, you’ll have to save $8,200 per year to reach that same goal by 62.​</p>\n<p>By making financial management a priority, you not only take control of your finances now, but you’re also taking control of your future too.</p>\n","id":"4806e54b-0d01-5dc3-97f7-66aacf9475141content_blocksWordPressAcf_regular_content"},{"__typename":"WordPressAcf_featured_content","featured_content_block":[{"content":"<h4>Ready to take control of your life with Financial Planning?</h4>\n","image":{"source_url":"https://shermandev.cydoniacloudserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/guys-talking-451x451.jpg","id":"27ab997f-3593-562a-abc7-7c7adcad4c4e"}},{"content":"<h4>Want to learn about our smart, strategic approach to investing?</h4>\n","image":{"source_url":"https://shermandev.cydoniacloudserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/classroom-574x574.jpg","id":"8e41d01a-7f41-52da-879f-f3585934ad6e"}},{"content":"<h4>Curious about how tax planning can have an impact on your savings?</h4>\n","image":{"source_url":"https://shermandev.cydoniacloudserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/guys-talking-451x451.jpg","id":"27ab997f-3593-562a-abc7-7c7adcad4c4e"}}],"id":"4806e54b-0d01-5dc3-97f7-66aacf9475142content_blocksWordPressAcf_featured_content"}]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"young-professionals"}}}
