After all, they’re already doing what they love, so why not simply keep doing these things forever? On the other hand, they may see the business as their retirement plan, a large bucket of capital that will fund all their needs. Unfortunately, this can be a big mistake. To the contrary, a business owner probably needs more retirement planning versus less. Why? Because there will eventually come a time when he or she can longer work or just does not want to work. In this situation, the business cannot fully provide for their day-to-day financial needs. The good news is that business ownership allows for many tax-advantageous ways to build a plan for retirement. This also presents the opportunity to save considerably larger amounts of money than what is allowed to non-business owners.</p>\n","image":null}],"id":"77fea357-8434-5c2a-bfda-5bd6339cb2942content_blocksWordPressAcf_featured_content"}]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"small-business-owners"}}}
