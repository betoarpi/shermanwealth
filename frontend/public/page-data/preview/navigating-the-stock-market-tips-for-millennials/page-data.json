If you get started now, you&#8217;ll be maximizing your chances of hitting those marks on your way to achieving your goals!</p>\n<p>Here are some basic tips to help you get started.</p>\n<h3>7 Tips For The Long Term Investor</h3>\n<p>● <b>Start today</b><b>:</b> Procrastination can put a large dent in your ultimate savings. Whether you&#8217;re investing in a retirement savings plans or a regular investment account, it&#8217;s important to start early so that your investments compound. Remember, even small amounts add up over time!</p>\n<p>● <b>Create a plan and stick with it:</b> There are many ways to be successful and no one strategy is inherently better than any other. Once you find your style, stick with it. Bouncing in and out of the market makes is just as likely you will miss some of the best days and hit the worst.  Readjust your portfolio when necessary, but not too often.</p>\n<p>● <b>Think long term and be disciplined:</b> Be prepared to buy and hold your positions. Big short-term profits can be enticing when you&#8217;re new to the market but short-term wins will get you off track. Start a program, stay invested, and don’t be too concerned with day-to-day profits and losses.  Warren Buffet once asked, “Suppose you’re going to be investing for the next several years. Do you want the price of the stocks to go up or down?&#8221; While everybody assumes it&#8217;s &#8220;up,&#8221; in reality, it’s only people who are withdrawing in the near future who really want stocks to go up!</p>\n<p>● <b>Do your research:</b> Always be an informed investor. Do your own due diligence with companies you&#8217;re interested in. Don’t go for a ‘hot tip’ just because there&#8217;s a lot of buzz; research companies, get advice, and decide if they&#8217;re investments that are right for you.</p>\n<p>● <b>Never let your emotions influence you:</b> The markets move in cycles. When the markets are up, we feel elated about our investment decisions. When markets start to move down, we may experience anxiety and panic. Reacting emotionally can lead to spur of the moment decisions that don&#8217;t benefit you in the long run. Again: think long term.</p>\n<p>● <b>Always have a margin of safety:</b> The first rule anyone new to investing needs to learn is that there are no guarantees in the stock market. An investment that looks great on paper does not always pan out in real life.  Know how much risk you are willing to take and make sure your investments are aligned with your risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>● <b>Diversify:</b> Never put all your eggs in one kind of basket. It&#8217;s important to make sure your portfolio includes both stocks and yield-producing assets, such as bonds, to cushion you against market volatility. Diversification doesn&#8217;t just mean investing in multiple companies either; investigate ways to invest in different markets, bother national and international, as well.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">One final tip: find an experienced financial planner you trust, who &#8220;gets&#8221; you, your goals, and your timeline, and who can guide you as you invest in your future.</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brad Sherman is a financial planner who is committed to helping individuals and families achieve financial independence and gain confidence with regard to financial issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Call or contact him today to see if his services are a good fit for your needs.</span></p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dollar-cost-averaging/\">What is Dollar Cost Averaging?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-things-investors-get-wrong/\">5 Things Investors Get Wrong</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont/\">5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p id=\":4pl\" class=\"hP\" tabindex=\"-1\">LFS-996518-082214</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":null,"acf":null}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":741}}}
