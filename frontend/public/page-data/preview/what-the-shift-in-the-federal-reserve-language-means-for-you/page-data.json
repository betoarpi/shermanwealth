Powell knocked that idea, by explaining that the central bank still sees the weakness as the result of “transitory” factors, such as portfolio management services, lower apparel prices and airfares.  The Fed’s target on inflation is 2%, and the core PCE rate watched by the Fed fell to a surprising 1.6% in the first quarter.&#8221;   President Donald Trump, who earlier this week urged the Fed to cut the rate by 1 percentage point was most likely frustrated with the Fed chair as well.</p>\n<p>Since the Fed did not indicate which direction the next move may be, this is a good time to review any variable interest rates you have (student loans, etc.). Use this opportunity to pay down these types of<br />\ndebts and boost your savings cushions. And, for those of you who might be getting tax refunds,<br />\nyou may want to think about using that money to add to your savings or pay down debt.<br />\nAs your April 30 bank statements come in, this is an opportune time to re-evaluate your<br />\nchecking and savings accounts. If you aren’t earning at least 2% for your short-term goals, you<br />\nshould be looking into some new options.</p>\n<p>With some mortgage rates are at a low of 3.125%, there are hopes that this will continue to<br />\nstimulate the housing market. It’s also a good time to look at your current mortgage rate. If<br />\nyou have an ARM that’s expiring (adjustable rate mortgage), now is good time to consider<br />\nwhether it might be worth converting that to a fixed rate mortgage. Now is the time to take advantage of lower long term rates that may not be here forever.</p>\n<p>We feel that Greg McBride at BankRate sums it up best in this tweet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr valign=\"bottom\">\n<td width=\"48\"><img class=\"CToWUd\" src=\"https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/s_3GCwQcvpO-4PjcedB5kU8FByfHwY9UQtlCwop8yaRfSY5pUxX4hnlZkXb98bFaQEhDT3bnD51uMI45mKftF-ZJBn5iUIUKVW7O8zz2nVOl9Wp9aT90iSFlnxK5hA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/694291009749016579/-rnMsMwy_normal.jpg\" /></td>\n<td><b>Greg McBride, CFA (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankrategreg?s=11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/bankrategreg?s%3D11&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556896148496000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGei2C391g4gcM-Q0PR-fEHLwqAbQ\">@BankrateGreg</a>)</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<div><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankrategreg/status/1123652625294090241?s=11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/bankrategreg/status/1123652625294090241?s%3D11&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556896148497000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHF0fKabZ4ram4Kf2pkeBaf1idYRg\">5/1/19, 2:17 PM</a></div>\n<div>For consumers, the reprieve from rising rates will continue.
