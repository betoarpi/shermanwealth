Think of Your Goals","slug":"election-volatility-had-you-spooked-think-of-your-goals","content":"<p>Were you keeping an anxious eye on your investment accounts leading up to last nights’ election? Are you relieved they seem to be climbing again?</p>\n<p>In spite of the plunge in the futures market last night as it became apparent that Donald Trump would beat favored Hillary Clinton to become America&#8217;s 45th President, much of the market has now climbed back even higher than it was yesterday and are close to their all time highs.</p>\n<p>That’s important to note for several reasons.</p>\n<p>As our friend <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2016/11/07/the-week-when-advice-mattered/\">Josh Brown put it</a>, “it starts with understanding why you’re investing in the first place—a detailed financial plan with hard objectives and goals.” To do that, we work with our clients to focus on short-, medium- and long-term goals so that you can understand what your time frame is and what is needed to achieve it.</p>\n<p>The short-term nature of much of the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">volatility</a> that characterizes the markets is exactly why dollar-cost averaging is such a smart way to invest.

With a fully diversified asset allocation strategy, there will be parts of your portfolio that go<br />\nup,<br />\nas well as other parts that go down, during times of stress. That way you’ll be comfortable sticking to your investment strategy and plan through peaks and dips. Not only that, but you will have purchased those less volatile instruments before pundits start shouting and everyone starts panic-purchasing, driving the costs up.
