Dimensional Fund Advisors’ investment strategy is based on Fama’s early and ongoing research, and the students at this program were the financial advisors who sell its products. Fama is a recent Nobel Prize Winner and the two day, biannual program, held in Austin, Texas allowed the students to hear about new research and new strategies from Fama himself.</p>\n<h2>Strategies like Dimensional Funds Advisors</h2>\n<p>It may seem like an exclusive strategy and that the information that Professor Fama spoke about during the two-day program is only available to a select number of people. In truth, this is a strategy that is available to everyone and we are very excited that Sherman Wealth Management can now offer services like this to you. We will determine if any of these strategies are right for your unique financial plan.</p>\n<p>We believe everyone deserves sophisticated financial advice.
