Was it “retire and live on a boat in Hawaii?” “Quit my job and become a deejay?” “Book a ride to the Space Station?” Or even just “Stop worrying about how to pay for my kids’ college?”</p>\n<p>Your answer &#8211; however crazy or however normal &#8211;  is a window into what’s really important to you and a great way of evaluating your current financial strategy. Is upgrading your home a potential goal? Have you budgeted enough for your passions? Should you start saving more for more travel and adventure? Have you looked into 529 plans?</p>\n<p>As a Financial Advisor, I would advise that you not waste that $2 when it would be better spent collecting compound interest. I would ask you whether you’d already contributed to your 401K plan, your emergency fund, and your other long or short term savings goals. Then I would suggest that if you really wanted to play Powerball, that you re-allocate that $2 from another area –  skipping the caramel latte this morning, for instance, or biking to work tomorrow to save on gas – so that the $2 is amortized.</p>\n<p>But I would also tell you to keep dreaming, because those things you are dreaming about are a great way to evaluate whether your current savings and investment goals are tailor-made to help you achieve the life you really want, the life you’d lead if there was nothing standing in your way.</p>\n<p>So consider it: if you won $90 million dollars, what’s the first thing you’d do? Now call your financial advisor and take the first step to actually making that happen.</p>\n<p>p.s. &#8211; If you want to see what your chances of winning actually are, <a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/powerball-simulator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here</a> to try the LA Times’ Powerball Simulator!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
