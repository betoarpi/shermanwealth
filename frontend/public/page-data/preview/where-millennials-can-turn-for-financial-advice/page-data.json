The <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/13/coming-soon-the-biggest-wealth-transfer-in-history.html\">biggest wealth transfer in history </a>is beginning, as Millennials will soon become the wealth bearing demographic in this county.  Not surprisingly, as we pointed out in a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Personal%20Finance%20Blog\">recent blog post</a>, personal finance is a huge issue for many Millennials. But where can a Millennial turn for advice?</p>\n<p>Goals, dreams, jobs, family plans, etc. are going to vary widely, but there a few common themes that seem relevant across the spectrum. We constantly write on many of these issues, so decided to summarize the topics for you and answer some of those nagging questions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting started</strong> is often the hardest part. Beginning a savings plan early is key, which makes planning all the more important. We constantly preach the importance of determining your short, intermediate and long term goals and then focusing on creating a plan on how to achieve them. Having the “money conversation” is a great way to get started. Remember, it’s not how much you make, but how much you save. Read more here on <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/money-conversation/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Money%20Conversation\">getting started with the money conversation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Student Loans/Debt</strong> &#8211; A common financial hurdle for many millennials is navigating student loans. So how do you determine if your focus should be on accelerating the payoff of that debt or maximizing saving instead? We wrote about that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/save-money-pay-debt/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Save%20Money%20or%20Pay%20Down%20Debt\">here</a><u>.</u></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investing</strong> &#8211; Only 26 percent of people under age 30 own stocks, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/more-millennials-say-no-to-stocks-and-advisors-adapt.html\">CNBC story. </a>Time is one of the greatest assets Millennials have working in their favor. Yet  because of various reasons that have scared many away from the stock market, a vast majority of millennials are missing out on <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Volatility%20and%20Compound%20Interest\">potential compound interest</a><u>, and other benefits of long term investing</u>. Fear and lack of financial comfort or literacy are two main reasons Millennials shy away from investing. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/ryans-open-letter-to-cnbc/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Millennials%20Letter%20CNBC\">I even responded to a Millennial’s letter to CNBC here</a>.  If you are unsure about some of the reasons you may want to consider exploring the stock market, read our blog on why <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/millennials-time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-stock-market/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Millennials%20Wake%20Up\">Millennials should wake up and smell the stock market</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowing Who to Trust</strong> &#8211; Even if you understand the advantages of investing in the stock market, it’s not always easy to find a professional you can trust. A recent <a href=\"http://insights.fb.com/2016/01/25/millennials-money-the-unfiltered-journey/\">facebook study</a> shows that over 50% of millennials have no one to trust for financial guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Picture1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3616 size-full\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Picture1.png\" alt=\"FB Study\" width=\"696\" height=\"271\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://insights.fb.com/2016/01/25/millennials-money-the-unfiltered-journey/\">insights.fb.com</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A few months back we wrote a piece titled <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Why%20Go%20Where%20Money%20Not%20Wanted\">“Why Go Where Your Money’s Not Wanted” </a>that touches on the point of many financial institutions turning down Millennials as clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades. As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first time investors, it’s actually one of the main reasons I created Sherman Wealth Management. It was important to me to make sure top notch financial advice was available to anyone and everyone,  particularly to those who are starting out on the path to wealth accumulation. We created this guide to make sure you are asking your potential financial advisors the right questions to determine if they are right for you. – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=6%20questions%20to%20ask%20advisor\">6 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marriage</strong> &#8211; Getting married is more than just substituting the word “ours” for “yours” and “mine”. It’s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions – even your music – and making all of that “ours” too. If you have started to think about marriage, or are married already, there are a few financial discussions you should be sure you have.  Since a significant part of those pre-marital dreams and aspirations involve money, having multiple financial conversations before marriage (or right after, if you’re newlyweds!) can help you start married life on a firmer footing, with regard to financial goals. Here are two blogs we wrote for those getting married or already married.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/10-things-to-discuss-before-marriage/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=10%20Things%20Before%20Marriage\">10 Things to Discuss Before Marriage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/7-things-married-couples-discuss-today/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=7%20Things%20Married%20Couples%20Should%20Discuss\">7 Things Married Couples Should Discuss Today</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buying a house</strong> &#8211; There are studies out there saying that Millennials are not buying houses. A prudent home purchase often can be one of the most stable and solid investments a young person can make. So why the hesitation? Some Millennials wonder if given the rate increase and current market turmoil – if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now? We wrote about this exact topic <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/do-interest-rates-have-you-worried-about-buying-a-first-home/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Interest%20Rates%20Buying%20House\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kids </strong>&#8211; Babies change your life in many ways, including requiring large amounts of time and money. While you may already be thinking about childcare costs and options, or about paying the medical bills that accompanied your new child, there are several other – important – financial considerations you should be thinking about even before the new baby arrives – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-planning-tips-new-parents/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=5%20Planning%20Tips%20for%20New%20Parents\">5 Planning Tips for New Parents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this all seems overwhelming, don’t be discouraged.
