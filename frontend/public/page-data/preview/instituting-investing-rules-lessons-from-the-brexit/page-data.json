The ultimate victory of the “leave” camp sent shock waves through political and financial sectors, as investors saw the British pound crash to a 30-year low and markets experienced a significant drop.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Rules-Based Investing</h2>\n<p>The Brexit tale is only just beginning, and its ultimate effects are anyone’s best guess. That said, there is a lot to be learned from what’s already happened. We think that in the aftermath of Brexit, you need investing rules that you stick to hard and fast.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The market crash post-Brexit panicked a lot of investors. Of course, investors and advisors should have <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basic philosophies</a> that they stick to, even in times of market crashes, such as not following the herd and selling off when a stock is lowest. (You can read more about the detriments of panic selling <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.) But it may be beneficial to establish some firmer rules for exactly what qualities the investments you make will have.</p>\n<p>For example, consider <a href=\"https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/June-2016-10-Questions.aspx?platform=hootsuite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the following</a> from Kevin O’Leary, Shark Tank judge and O’Shares chairman: “Imagine if you could create the perfect portfolio manager that had no style drift, that never, ever got emotionally involved in a stock, that only used the most hardcore rules on balance sheet testing, and never, ever strayed from that. That’s what rule-based investing is. It takes out one of the challenges I’ve found as an investor over the decades.”</p>\n<p>In other words, you have to eliminate emotion from your investing. As a retirement saver, this can be incredibly difficult after big market swings, whether up or down. We’ve <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previously explained why active management doesn’t win</a> and one of the benefits of passive investment management is that since it takes a long-term view, it reduces the role of emotion in investment decisions. Creating investing rules can be a good extension of this strategy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/070616/instituting-investing-rules-lessons-brexit/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
