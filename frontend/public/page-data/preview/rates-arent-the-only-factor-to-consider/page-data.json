From interest rates to data on home starts, it has been a high priority topic for a lot of households. Not to mention the buzz around the <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/slow-down/\">different real estate pockets</a> that may or may not be losing steam. This has, for better or worse, caught the attention of many investors. But let’s take all the headlines out of the equation and look at what’s really going on behind the curtains.</p>\n<p>We have had many questions lately from clients and others who are curious as to if there is still “room” in the cycle to purchase a home. There seems to be so much worry out there. “Have I waited too long?” Of course, when it comes to the largest financial purchase of your life, it’s totally normal to be hesitant. After 2007, no one wants to buy real estate if they feel we are on the verge of a downswing in housing prices and/or rates. However, this attitude somewhat surprises me. Why? Because mortgage rates are at the same levels they were at almost a year ago, yet the noise from the media has grown so much louder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mortgate-rates-and-10-year-treasury.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4982\" src=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mortgate-rates-and-10-year-treasury.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"501\" /></a></p>\n<p>But, let us not forget that interest rates are not the only piece of the puzzle! Many other factors must be accounted for when purchasing a home in order to get the “full picture”. From talking with CPAs and other professionals in there area, we are discovering that Wealthy households. are much more focused on the loss of the SALT deduction than what interest rate they may receive on their next real estate purchase.</p>\n<p>Another main factor, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which was passed in 2018, will have a big impact on those who are looking to purchase real estate, particularly in the DC Metro. Why is this? Because of the changes in state and local tax (SALT) deductions, which are now capped at $10,000. In states like Maryland, where high state income taxes will eat up most of the SALT deduction, the cap is likely to affect homebuying decisions, as prospective home purchasers seek to minimize their property taxes. The <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/how-taxpayers-dc-and-its-suburbs-would-fare-under-new-tax-law\">variations become greater</a> for taxpayers with annual income between $100,000 and $200,000. Generally, households in the Maryland counties tend to benefit less from the TCJA than those in Virginia largely because Maryland has higher combined state and county taxes. In fact, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/taxes/trumps-plan-to-eliminate-the-state-and-local-tax-deduction-explained\">a whopping 45.04% of Maryland tax returns included a deduction</a> for state and local taxes in 2014. That’s the highest percentage of returns claiming SALT deductions of any state. The average size of those deductions was $12,442.78.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, if you’re worried about interest rates having an impact on the “all-in” cost of your next (first?) real estate purchase, you’re forgetting about another large factor: SALT deductions. And since the environment has changed drastically for states like Maryland, these calculations should be a part of your due diligence and planning.
