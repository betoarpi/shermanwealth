The most common debate revolves around the 15-year versus the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. With interest rates near all-time lows, there have been many recent articles outlining different sides of this debate. One in particular that caught my attention was this <a href=\"http://www.time.com/money/4443932/15-year-mortgage-advantages/\">article</a> from Time quoting financial experts about why a 15-year mortgage can potentially make more sense than a 30-year mortgage.\n\nLet me preface this by saying every situation is going to be different, and that the following considerations are based on the current interest rate environment. Let’s look at the arguments made and examine why the psychological component of a 15-year mortgage may be advantageous to some, but the mathematical evidence shows us otherwise.\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 1 for a 15-year mortgage: Save More Money</h2>\n<em>“Taking out a 15-year mortgage dramatically cuts your home-loan repayment time. The faster you repay the loan, the less in interest you need to pay. This can save you tens of thousands of dollars over the (shorter) life of your loan. A 15-year mortgage also usually offers better interest rates than other loan products,\" says Debbie Todd, a CPA.</em>\n\n</div>\n<strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong>\n\nThe problem with this is that interest rates are now hovering right around the range of inflation (around 4% or lower). Assuming you would invest in the stock market with the excess money you’d be saving on monthly payments by acquiring a 30-year mortgage rather than a 15-year mortgage, and assuming recent average historical returns, your money can do far better for you in that manner. Let's take a look at an example of Jordan and Matt, each of whom wants to get a $400,000 mortgage. For this example, we will make it simple by assuming there is no down payment on the house.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage1.png\" />\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>*<a href=\"http://bretwhissel.net/cgi-bin/amortize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://bretwhissel.net/cgi-bin/amortize</a></em></h5>\nMatt is paying $996.15 less than Jordan per month. Let’s say that Matt invests that full amount in the stock market each month which historically has returned 8% annually depending on the time period you look at (we will also look at it with a more conservative 6% and 4% rate of return). With these assumptions, Matt’s investment account will be worth:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage2.png\" />\n\nNot convinced by these numbers? Try out a free online <a href=\"https://investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator\">compound interest calculator</a>. So now let’s add that amount to the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a> Matt has in his house after five, 10 and 15 years and compare it to Jordan's investment.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage3.png\" />\n\n<em>** Using 8% annual rate of return. See chart above for other rates of return such as 4% and 6%.</em>\n\nAs you can see, as time goes on, the difference only gets greater. By the time Jordan has paid off his house in full, Matt will have accumulated $193,451.13 more equity that Jordan. Of course, if interest rates go up substantially, this analysis changes, but given the current market, it looks like Matt’s course is the wiser one.\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 2 for a 15-Year Mortgage: Build More Equity</h2>\n<em>“When you repay your mortgage faster, you don’t just save money — you build equity in your home faster too. Combine a shorter mortgage term with rising home prices, and you could exponentially grow the amount of equity you have.\" </em>\n\n</div>\n<i>\"This is beneficial for several reasons, especially if you want to refinance the loan down the road. “Since you are paying principal faster with a 15-year note,” explains Therese R. Nicklas, CFP, “you will be building equity faster, making refinancing potentially easier.” With a smaller loan-to-value ratio, the risk you present to your lender will be smaller, so you should have more financial opportunities.\"</i>\n\nThe argument here is that by repaying the loan faster, you not only save money on the lifespan of the loan, you also build equity in the home faster.\n\n<strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong>\n\nThe problem with this is that a home is not an investment, in the truest sense of the term. We say that because of the carrying costs that come with purchasing a home. Most investments don’t require ongoing investments. Between your mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities and general maintenance, these ongoing expenses will at a minimum partially offset the amount of market value the house could theoretically gain over the course of your ownership.\n\nWe constantly preach the importance of diversification. For the vast majority of first time home buyers, the home is far and away their most valuable asset. By accelerating your mortgage, in this scenario, you are putting an enormous percentage of your net worth into one asset, which is contrary to the notion of prudent diversification. Even worse? Your home is not a liquid asset. It’s not like investing in other assets such as the stock market, where if a crisis occurred you would be able to sell your investment and get the funds. You can’t just sell a house overnight.\n\nEven if there is a time period of deflation, that doesn’t change the point that once your cash goes into a house, it is much harder to get out. In this type of scenario, you could always prepay your mortgage.\n\nTo further explain this point, let’s look at how it would all play out after 30 years if Jordan decided to start investing the full amount of his mortgage payment after he finishes paying off his house in 15 years. At the same time, Matt will continue his monthly contribution for the remaining 15 years of his mortgage.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage4.png\" />\n\nThat’s a difference of $528,750.10 over a 30 year period. To show you that this works even at 4%, here's the comparison with that rate of growth:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage5.png\" />\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 3 for a 15-year mortgage: Reduce Pressure on Your Monthly Budget in Retirement</h2>\n<em>“Getting a 15-year mortgage might help if you plan to retire in the next 10 to 20 years. Many people want to downsize before they retire, and that means buying a new home. “Choosing a 15-year mortgage allows you to reduce the strain on your cash flow in retirement,” says Eric Roberge, a financial planner.\"</em>\n\n</div>\n<em>“You can take advantage of stronger cash flow while you’re working to make the bigger monthly payments that a 15-year mortgage requires and pay off the loan before you retire,” Roberge says. “Then, when you do retire, you won’t have to pull as much out of your savings to cover living expenses since your loan will be gone.”</em>\n\n<strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong>\n\nWhile we agree with the general concept here, we want to make sure people understand there are other costs associated with owning a home than just the mortgage. There is no doubt a physiological advantage to reducing the pressure on your budget in retirement but as we aim to point out, the math doesn’t always support that in full.\n\nYou still have to pay for taxes, insurance, upkeep and repairs. Another issue we have is that we are neither factoring in inflation nor the other expenses that come with owning a home. Expenses such as insurance and taxes will continue to increase with inflation. At the same time, as I allude to above, when you factor in inflation, your housing payment actually gets cheaper each year in real dollars.\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 4 for a 15-year Mortgage: Take Advantage of Built-in Discipline</h2>\n<em>\"Instead of considering 15-year mortgages, some people take out a 30-year mortgage and simply accelerate the payments they make on that loan. They get the benefit of saving money on interest but aren’t tied to the higher monthly payment. But Todd Tresidder, a money coach, explains that while this sounds good, the situation isn’t always so simple. “If your intention is to pay off the mortgage in 15 years, then commit to it,” he says. “You may prefer the flexibility of a lower mortgage payment by getting a 30-year loan, and you may honestly have the best intentions to add principal to pay it off in 15 years anyway.”</em>\n\n</div>\n<em>\"However, many people just don’t follow through with that plan. It’s too easy to fall back on making the smaller, easier payment and using the extra payment money for other purchases instead. “Without the enforced discipline of the required payment, it won’t happen,” says Tresidder. “So just be honest with yourself.”</em>\n\n<strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong>\n\nIf you don’t have the discipline to pay off your monthly expenses then you should rethink whether it makes sense to buy real property at this time. If, on the other hand, you are confident that you can hold yourself accountable to paying off your monthly expenses, why not afford yourself more flexibility? You can always pay off a 30-year fixed mortgage in 15 years, but you can’t do the reverse. (For related reading, see <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/got-a-raise-heres-how-to-avoid-lifestyle-creep/\"><em>Got a Raise? Here’s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep</em></a>)\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\nIn summary, we agree that doing something for psychological reasons — as well as to achieve a sense of security and fiscal prudence — has merit. Having said that, by understanding the interest rate market and the pros and cons of home mortgage schedules, you may rethink the psychology of the idea that 15-year mortgages are wiser than 30-year mortgages. It pays to recognize that there are additional factors that may turn this debate in another direction.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/093016/15year-vs-30year-mortgages-comparison/\">Investopedia.com</a></em>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***\n</em></p>\n\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

It’s a time we engage in self-reflection, ideas for self-improvement, and new – or ongoing – resolutions and goals.\n\nOne of the most common resolutions is losing weight, but we all know how that goes: crowded gyms in early January, inevitable drop-off when February rolls around. In fact, a <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/\"><u>study</u></a> done by the University of Scranton shows that only about 8% of people actually achieve their resolutions.\n\nFinancial resolutions often include starting – or finally sticking to - a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp\">budget</a>. Unfortunately, that resolution is all-too-often hard to stick to as well. (For related reading, see <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/newyear.asp\"><em>Financial New Year's Resolutions You Can Keep</em></a>.)\n\nWhy do so many people have trouble sticking to their resolutions? One of the main reasons is having unrealistic expectations. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><u>Overconfidence</u></a> doesn’t just affect fitness goals, it affects investors’ behavior as well.\n\nHow can you make this the year you stick to your goals?\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Take Baby Steps</h2>\nBe reasonable in assessing where you are with your finances and don’t try to tackle everything at once. Start by listing all the areas of your financial situation you would like to improve. Then prioritize the individual elements in order of importance to you, and start by taking on one or two at a time. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/102516/achieve-your-financial-goals-financial-plan/\"><em>Achieve Your Financial Goals With a Financial Plan</em></a>.)\n\nIf one of your goals is to start - and stick to - budgeting, don’t give yourself super-strict boundaries. Instead, start by creating good habits one at a time. If you want to pay off all of your <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp\">credit card debt</a>, for instance, take a look at how much debt you have and create a <u>realistic</u> weekly or monthly plan to start paying it off. If you want to buy a house in five years, you could decide to spend less now on something that you currently enjoy.

Here’s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep</em></a>.)\n\nFocus on one or two goals at a time, see how it goes, and make progress – and adjustments – to stay on track.\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Be Specific</h2>\nInstead of saying “I am going to save more this year,” or “I am going to save $5,000 this year,” try to specify exactly how you plan to do it. Start with something like: “I will take $100 from each paycheck and put it into a savings account.” By giving yourself a tangible – achievable - steps, you’ll be better able to track how well you are sticking to it.\n\nIn addition, try to think about what it is that you are trying to accomplish. Why do you want to save an extra $100 each paycheck? Are you saving up for a car? Trying to pay off debt? Building up an emergency fund? When you add purpose to your goals, it makes it more compelling and easier to accomplish.

Are you someone who might let things build up then feel too overwhelmed to jump back on track? Think about sharing your goals with a friend or family member and set times to check in with them and go over your progress. If you want to go to the gym three days a week, think about getting a workout partner. If you want to save an extra $100 from each paycheck, see if there is a friend that has the same goal and you can do it together, comparing how it’s going throughout the journey.\n\nMost importantly, understand that this is a process. Some weeks will be better than others, but, if you can follow these three steps – set realistic goals, set specific goals, be accountable - hopefully you will be part of the 8% that gets it done this year.

And this season, as in previous ones, fans will be wondering why some fantasy team managers just seem to have a knack for finding those sleepers and high upside players, while other managers routinely fail to understand and predict player value.\n\nInvestors often wonder the same thing: why do some investors consistently get it right and prosper, while others are lucky if they even break even?\n\nCoincidence? Maybe, but there are several important things successful fantasy football managers have in common with successful real-life investors.\n\nHere are three important mindsets that can help you go the whole 9 yards, whether it’s on the virtual gridiron or with your own financial plan.\n\n<strong>Research the Players</strong>\n\nA good fantasy football manager knows that you need to study all the different variables - including roster positions, draft picks, and expected performance – to build a winning team. Understanding the available options is critical to determining things like how many players you need at each position and which players you think will be the best.\n\nThis same principal applies to investing. A smart investor or financial advisor starts by understanding all the different variables, such as capital, types of investments, and asset classes. Understanding the pros and cons of various investment strategies is critical in determining how to choose a strategy that is the appropriate option for your own goals and needs.\n\n<strong>Never count on a couple of stars to carry the team</strong>\n\nWhen drafting your fantasy team, you always want to diversify your risk. You might not want to draft multiple offense players from the Green Bay Packers, for instance, even if that team is loaded with talent, because, if Aaron Rodgers and company have a bad week, your fantasy team will be struggling too. Smart fantasy managers build a stable foundation and don’t just count on rising stars.\n\nWhen building your investment portfolio, risk diversification is critical as well. Wall Street is littered with stories of investors who put all their eggs in one “sure” basket, only to learn the lesson of diversification the hard way. Even if you’re extremely confident that a certain sector is a good bet, it’s usually better to diversify and limit your amount of exposure to individual sectors. That way, even if the sector doesn’t do as well as you had anticipated, your investments are distributed across other asset classes, and your risk should be better managed.\n\n<strong>When the going gets tough, the tough stay disciplined</strong>\n\nAnyone who has played fantasy football knows the danger of making a snap waiver wire decision you’ll regret later. On one hand, you don’t want to panic and drop your star player after a rough few weeks, only to see him rebound to a MVP-caliber season (and on someone else’s team!) On the other hand, just because an unproven player has a great week doesn’t mean he’s more valuable than the player you’d have to drop in order to acquire him.\n\nWhen the market hits a volatile patch, it takes a disciplined investor to trust their plan and avoid making snap decisions about buying and selling. A look at the history of the stock market makes it abundantly clear that investors who take a long term view do better than those who shift their investment strategies with every changing wind. This doesn’t mean that any plan should be viewed as foolproof; a good investor or financial advisor knows the value of reassessing and recalibrating appropriately and strategically. What it does mean is that, when the going gets tough, a prudent investor takes the long view, stays disciplined, and sticks to a strategy.\n\n<strong>It’s a long season</strong>\n\nThe only NFL team in history to have an undefeated season is the Miami Dolphins who finished 17-0 in the shorter 1972 season. No NFL team has gone 19-0 to date so it’s highly unlikely that any fantasy team will achieve perfection either. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have a great season and get smarter and smarter about putting together a winning team.\n\nWith investing too, there will always be ups and downs, touchdowns and penalties, fumbles and conversions, and a few Hail Mary’s. But with a solid game plan and clearly defined goal, you’ll be on your way to a putting together a strategy designed to stand the test of time and put you squarely where you want to be: heading toward your own end zone with your eye on the ball and your own goals in sight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>LFS-1304073-091715</strong>\n\n&nbsp;"}]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":889}}}
