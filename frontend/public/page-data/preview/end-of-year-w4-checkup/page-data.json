If you withhold too little, you may owe the IRS come tax time. However, if you withhold too much, you could end up with </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/5-best-and-worst-places-to-live-in-the-us-for-getting-a-tax-refund.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a large refund</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which means you’ve essentially given an interest-free loan to the government.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by using the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IRS </span></i><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">withholding calculator</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to determine the right amount for you to withhold. If your situation is complicated, or </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/youre-probably-out-of-time-to-withhold-enough-pay-for-taxes-in-2018.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you’re confused</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you may also want to consult with an accountant.  In addition, you should also revisit the W-4 if you’ve had a major life changing event, such as having a child, getting married or divorced, or if your spouse dies.  Next, review what your current withholding is. If the numbers don’t match up, you’ll want to adjust your W-4, which you can do at any point during the year.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you revisit your W-4, it’s also important to keep in mind that the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/09/12/your-first-look-at-2020-tax-rates-projected-brackets-standard-deduction-amounts-and-more/#34ab9e827930\">2020 projected tax rate schedules</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to paying the right amount of tax is to update your W-4 regularly. You should revisit your W-4 whenever you have a major personal life change. As we have written in the past, the potential for both a tax bill and a tax refund should be zero, or close to it. However, if you count on a big tax refund every year, pay attention to your withholding because it directly impacts your refund.  You can adjust your W-4 at any time throughout the year, but if you do it later in the year, there will be less impact on your taxes for that year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need any assistance with your taxes or updating your W-4, you should speak to a professional.  We are happy to provide you with CPA recommendations if you would like.
