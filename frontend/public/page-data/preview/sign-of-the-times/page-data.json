not stuck lamenting the past.  </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So… just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times.  </span></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**</span></i></p>\n<h6><b><i>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
