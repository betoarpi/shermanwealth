I think when you’re able to relax and have a beer, hear what everyone else is thinking about financially and truly see that you are not alone and other people have the same fears around money it enables the conversation to expand and for questions to surface that you may not have asked before.</p>\n<p>I created the idea of <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/beers-with-brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Beers with Brad</strong></a> because people are so hesitant to speak up about their financial anxieties and worries about how to save for retirement.  Many questions surround saving for kids college education and how to valuate the interest rate on your student loan debt versus what you could be potentially making in the diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, and other asset classes.  There is so much information available that it can be overwhelming and many people I&#8217;ve talked to are searching for clear answers.</p>\n<p>As Morgan explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That’s because investing is not the study of finance. It’s the study of how people behave with money. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. You can’t sum up behavior with formulas to memorize or spreadsheet models to follow. Behavior is inborn, varies by person, is hard to measure, changes over time, and people are prone to deny its existence, especially when describing themselves. &#8211;<em><a href=\"http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morgan Housel</a></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Young families have so much going on in their lives that they don’t have the time to discuss personal finances and one of the greatest stresses in a marriage is finance.  We created this video to show exactly what <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/beers-with-brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Beers with Brad</strong> </a>is, how relaxed it is and how engaging the conversations are.</p>\n<h3>Plus, who doesn’t like a good local craft beer?</h3>\n<p><iframe title=\"Join Us for Beers With Brad\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/msM_rkQYkpc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about the event contact us at info@shermanwealth.com we hope to see you there!</p>\n<p>If you are unable to join this month, please let us know if you want to be added to the email list for the future events below:</p>\n<p>[contact-form-7 id=&#8221;4411&#8243; title=&#8221;Beers With Brad Updates&#8221;]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":null,"acf":null}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":856}}}
