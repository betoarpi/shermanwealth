The most common debate revolves around the 15-year versus the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. With interest rates near all-time lows, there have been many recent articles outlining different sides of this debate. One in particular that caught my attention was this <a href=\"http://www.time.com/money/4443932/15-year-mortgage-advantages/\">article</a> from Time quoting financial experts about why a 15-year mortgage can potentially make more sense than a 30-year mortgage.\n\nLet me preface this by saying every situation is going to be different, and that the following considerations are based on the current interest rate environment. Let’s look at the arguments made and examine why the psychological component of a 15-year mortgage may be advantageous to some, but the mathematical evidence shows us otherwise.\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 1 for a 15-year mortgage: Save More Money</h2>\n<em>“Taking out a 15-year mortgage dramatically cuts your home-loan repayment time. The faster you repay the loan, the less in interest you need to pay. This can save you tens of thousands of dollars over the (shorter) life of your loan. A 15-year mortgage also usually offers better interest rates than other loan products,\" says Debbie Todd, a CPA.</em>\n\n</div>\n<strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong>\n\nThe problem with this is that interest rates are now hovering right around the range of inflation (around 4% or lower). Assuming you would invest in the stock market with the excess money you’d be saving on monthly payments by acquiring a 30-year mortgage rather than a 15-year mortgage, and assuming recent average historical returns, your money can do far better for you in that manner. Let's take a look at an example of Jordan and Matt, each of whom wants to get a $400,000 mortgage. For this example, we will make it simple by assuming there is no down payment on the house.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage1.png\" />\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>*<a href=\"http://bretwhissel.net/cgi-bin/amortize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://bretwhissel.net/cgi-bin/amortize</a></em></h5>\nMatt is paying $996.15 less than Jordan per month. Let’s say that Matt invests that full amount in the stock market each month which historically has returned 8% annually depending on the time period you look at (we will also look at it with a more conservative 6% and 4% rate of return). With these assumptions, Matt’s investment account will be worth:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage2.png\" />\n\nNot convinced by these numbers? Try out a free online <a href=\"https://investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator\">compound interest calculator</a>. So now let’s add that amount to the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a> Matt has in his house after five, 10 and 15 years and compare it to Jordan's investment.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage3.png\" />\n\n<em>** Using 8% annual rate of return. See chart above for other rates of return such as 4% and 6%.</em>\n\nAs you can see, as time goes on, the difference only gets greater. By the time Jordan has paid off his house in full, Matt will have accumulated $193,451.13 more equity that Jordan. Of course, if interest rates go up substantially, this analysis changes, but given the current market, it looks like Matt’s course is the wiser one.\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 2 for a 15-Year Mortgage: Build More Equity</h2>\n<em>“When you repay your mortgage faster, you don’t just save money — you build equity in your home faster too. Combine a shorter mortgage term with rising home prices, and you could exponentially grow the amount of equity you have.\" </em>\n\n</div>\n<i>\"This is beneficial for several reasons, especially if you want to refinance the loan down the road. “Since you are paying principal faster with a 15-year note,” explains Therese R. Nicklas, CFP, “you will be building equity faster, making refinancing potentially easier.” With a smaller loan-to-value ratio, the risk you present to your lender will be smaller, so you should have more financial opportunities.\"</i>\n\nThe argument here is that by repaying the loan faster, you not only save money on the lifespan of the loan, you also build equity in the home faster.\n\n<strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong>\n\nThe problem with this is that a home is not an investment, in the truest sense of the term. We say that because of the carrying costs that come with purchasing a home. Most investments don’t require ongoing investments. Between your mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities and general maintenance, these ongoing expenses will at a minimum partially offset the amount of market value the house could theoretically gain over the course of your ownership.\n\nWe constantly preach the importance of diversification. For the vast majority of first time home buyers, the home is far and away their most valuable asset. By accelerating your mortgage, in this scenario, you are putting an enormous percentage of your net worth into one asset, which is contrary to the notion of prudent diversification. Even worse? Your home is not a liquid asset. It’s not like investing in other assets such as the stock market, where if a crisis occurred you would be able to sell your investment and get the funds. You can’t just sell a house overnight.\n\nEven if there is a time period of deflation, that doesn’t change the point that once your cash goes into a house, it is much harder to get out. In this type of scenario, you could always prepay your mortgage.\n\nTo further explain this point, let’s look at how it would all play out after 30 years if Jordan decided to start investing the full amount of his mortgage payment after he finishes paying off his house in 15 years. At the same time, Matt will continue his monthly contribution for the remaining 15 years of his mortgage.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage4.png\" />\n\nThat’s a difference of $528,750.10 over a 30 year period. To show you that this works even at 4%, here's the comparison with that rate of growth:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage5.png\" />\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 3 for a 15-year mortgage: Reduce Pressure on Your Monthly Budget in Retirement</h2>\n<em>“Getting a 15-year mortgage might help if you plan to retire in the next 10 to 20 years. Many people want to downsize before they retire, and that means buying a new home. “Choosing a 15-year mortgage allows you to reduce the strain on your cash flow in retirement,” says Eric Roberge, a financial planner.\"</em>\n\n</div>\n<em>“You can take advantage of stronger cash flow while you’re working to make the bigger monthly payments that a 15-year mortgage requires and pay off the loan before you retire,” Roberge says. “Then, when you do retire, you won’t have to pull as much out of your savings to cover living expenses since your loan will be gone.”</em>\n\n<strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong>\n\nWhile we agree with the general concept here, we want to make sure people understand there are other costs associated with owning a home than just the mortgage. There is no doubt a physiological advantage to reducing the pressure on your budget in retirement but as we aim to point out, the math doesn’t always support that in full.\n\nYou still have to pay for taxes, insurance, upkeep and repairs. Another issue we have is that we are neither factoring in inflation nor the other expenses that come with owning a home. Expenses such as insurance and taxes will continue to increase with inflation. At the same time, as I allude to above, when you factor in inflation, your housing payment actually gets cheaper each year in real dollars.\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 4 for a 15-year Mortgage: Take Advantage of Built-in Discipline</h2>\n<em>\"Instead of considering 15-year mortgages, some people take out a 30-year mortgage and simply accelerate the payments they make on that loan. They get the benefit of saving money on interest but aren’t tied to the higher monthly payment. But Todd Tresidder, a money coach, explains that while this sounds good, the situation isn’t always so simple. “If your intention is to pay off the mortgage in 15 years, then commit to it,” he says. “You may prefer the flexibility of a lower mortgage payment by getting a 30-year loan, and you may honestly have the best intentions to add principal to pay it off in 15 years anyway.”</em>\n\n</div>\n<em>\"However, many people just don’t follow through with that plan. It’s too easy to fall back on making the smaller, easier payment and using the extra payment money for other purchases instead. “Without the enforced discipline of the required payment, it won’t happen,” says Tresidder. “So just be honest with yourself.”</em>\n\n<strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong>\n\nIf you don’t have the discipline to pay off your monthly expenses then you should rethink whether it makes sense to buy real property at this time. If, on the other hand, you are confident that you can hold yourself accountable to paying off your monthly expenses, why not afford yourself more flexibility? You can always pay off a 30-year fixed mortgage in 15 years, but you can’t do the reverse. (For related reading, see <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/got-a-raise-heres-how-to-avoid-lifestyle-creep/\"><em>Got a Raise? Here’s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep</em></a>)\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\nIn summary, we agree that doing something for psychological reasons — as well as to achieve a sense of security and fiscal prudence — has merit. Having said that, by understanding the interest rate market and the pros and cons of home mortgage schedules, you may rethink the psychology of the idea that 15-year mortgages are wiser than 30-year mortgages. It pays to recognize that there are additional factors that may turn this debate in another direction.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/093016/15year-vs-30year-mortgages-comparison/\">Investopedia.com</a></em>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***\n</em></p>\n\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

It’s a time we engage in self-reflection, ideas for self-improvement, and new – or ongoing – resolutions and goals.\n\nOne of the most common resolutions is losing weight, but we all know how that goes: crowded gyms in early January, inevitable drop-off when February rolls around. In fact, a <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/\"><u>study</u></a> done by the University of Scranton shows that only about 8% of people actually achieve their resolutions.\n\nFinancial resolutions often include starting – or finally sticking to - a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp\">budget</a>. Unfortunately, that resolution is all-too-often hard to stick to as well. (For related reading, see <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/newyear.asp\"><em>Financial New Year's Resolutions You Can Keep</em></a>.)\n\nWhy do so many people have trouble sticking to their resolutions? One of the main reasons is having unrealistic expectations. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><u>Overconfidence</u></a> doesn’t just affect fitness goals, it affects investors’ behavior as well.\n\nHow can you make this the year you stick to your goals?\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Take Baby Steps</h2>\nBe reasonable in assessing where you are with your finances and don’t try to tackle everything at once. Start by listing all the areas of your financial situation you would like to improve. Then prioritize the individual elements in order of importance to you, and start by taking on one or two at a time. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/102516/achieve-your-financial-goals-financial-plan/\"><em>Achieve Your Financial Goals With a Financial Plan</em></a>.)\n\nIf one of your goals is to start - and stick to - budgeting, don’t give yourself super-strict boundaries. Instead, start by creating good habits one at a time. If you want to pay off all of your <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp\">credit card debt</a>, for instance, take a look at how much debt you have and create a <u>realistic</u> weekly or monthly plan to start paying it off. If you want to buy a house in five years, you could decide to spend less now on something that you currently enjoy. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/091916/got-raise-heres-how-avoid-lifestyle-creep/\"><em>Got a Raise? Here’s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep</em></a>.)\n\nFocus on one or two goals at a time, see how it goes, and make progress – and adjustments – to stay on track.\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Be Specific</h2>\nInstead of saying “I am going to save more this year,” or “I am going to save $5,000 this year,” try to specify exactly how you plan to do it. Start with something like: “I will take $100 from each paycheck and put it into a savings account.” By giving yourself a tangible – achievable - steps, you’ll be better able to track how well you are sticking to it.\n\nIn addition, try to think about what it is that you are trying to accomplish. Why do you want to save an extra $100 each paycheck? Are you saving up for a car? Trying to pay off debt? Building up an emergency fund? When you add purpose to your goals, it makes it more compelling and easier to accomplish. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/060816/why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><em>Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</em></a>)\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Stay Accountable</h2>\nKnow yourself: accept who you are and what that means. Are you someone who might let things build up then feel too overwhelmed to jump back on track? Think about sharing your goals with a friend or family member and set times to check in with them and go over your progress. If you want to go to the gym three days a week, think about getting a workout partner. If you want to save an extra $100 from each paycheck, see if there is a friend that has the same goal and you can do it together, comparing how it’s going throughout the journey.\n\nMost importantly, understand that this is a process. Some weeks will be better than others, but, if you can follow these three steps – set realistic goals, set specific goals, be accountable - hopefully you will be part of the 8% that gets it done this year.

And this season, as in previous ones, fans will be wondering why some fantasy team managers just seem to have a knack for finding those sleepers and high upside players, while other managers routinely fail to understand and predict player value.\n\nInvestors often wonder the same thing: why do some investors consistently get it right and prosper, while others are lucky if they even break even?\n\nCoincidence? Maybe, but there are several important things successful fantasy football managers have in common with successful real-life investors.\n\nHere are three important mindsets that can help you go the whole 9 yards, whether it’s on the virtual gridiron or with your own financial plan.\n\n<strong>Research the Players</strong>\n\nA good fantasy football manager knows that you need to study all the different variables - including roster positions, draft picks, and expected performance – to build a winning team. Understanding the available options is critical to determining things like how many players you need at each position and which players you think will be the best.\n\nThis same principal applies to investing. A smart investor or financial advisor starts by understanding all the different variables, such as capital, types of investments, and asset classes. Understanding the pros and cons of various investment strategies is critical in determining how to choose a strategy that is the appropriate option for your own goals and needs.\n\n<strong>Never count on a couple of stars to carry the team</strong>\n\nWhen drafting your fantasy team, you always want to diversify your risk. You might not want to draft multiple offense players from the Green Bay Packers, for instance, even if that team is loaded with talent, because, if Aaron Rodgers and company have a bad week, your fantasy team will be struggling too. Smart fantasy managers build a stable foundation and don’t just count on rising stars.\n\nWhen building your investment portfolio, risk diversification is critical as well. Wall Street is littered with stories of investors who put all their eggs in one “sure” basket, only to learn the lesson of diversification the hard way. Even if you’re extremely confident that a certain sector is a good bet, it’s usually better to diversify and limit your amount of exposure to individual sectors. That way, even if the sector doesn’t do as well as you had anticipated, your investments are distributed across other asset classes, and your risk should be better managed.\n\n<strong>When the going gets tough, the tough stay disciplined</strong>\n\nAnyone who has played fantasy football knows the danger of making a snap waiver wire decision you’ll regret later. On one hand, you don’t want to panic and drop your star player after a rough few weeks, only to see him rebound to a MVP-caliber season (and on someone else’s team!) On the other hand, just because an unproven player has a great week doesn’t mean he’s more valuable than the player you’d have to drop in order to acquire him.\n\nWhen the market hits a volatile patch, it takes a disciplined investor to trust their plan and avoid making snap decisions about buying and selling. A look at the history of the stock market makes it abundantly clear that investors who take a long term view do better than those who shift their investment strategies with every changing wind. This doesn’t mean that any plan should be viewed as foolproof; a good investor or financial advisor knows the value of reassessing and recalibrating appropriately and strategically. What it does mean is that, when the going gets tough, a prudent investor takes the long view, stays disciplined, and sticks to a strategy.\n\n<strong>It’s a long season</strong>\n\nThe only NFL team in history to have an undefeated season is the Miami Dolphins who finished 17-0 in the shorter 1972 season. No NFL team has gone 19-0 to date so it’s highly unlikely that any fantasy team will achieve perfection either. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have a great season and get smarter and smarter about putting together a winning team.\n\nWith investing too, there will always be ups and downs, touchdowns and penalties, fumbles and conversions, and a few Hail Mary’s. But with a solid game plan and clearly defined goal, you’ll be on your way to a putting together a strategy designed to stand the test of time and put you squarely where you want to be: heading toward your own end zone with your eye on the ball and your own goals in sight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>LFS-1304073-091715</strong>\n\n&nbsp;","post_name":"3-winning-strategies-investing-and-fantasy-football-share"}]}},"allWordpressPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Has Your Employer Suspended Its 401(k) Matching During COVID-19?","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a recent survey, 16.1 percent of organizations have suspended matching employer contributions due to financial hardships caused by COVID-19. Worse yet, 1.3 percent of businesses have terminated their 401(k) plans altogether.<sup><em>1</em></sup> 401(k) plans and their matching employer contributions are relied on by millions of Americans to bolster their savings for retirement. If your employer has recently made an adjustment to its 401(k) offerings, you may want to consider how this could impact your future retirement and the next steps you should be taking.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Why Are Employers Changing Their 401(k) Plans?</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on businesses throughout the globe. With most states implementing stay-at-home orders, businesses have been forced to reduce hours or cease operation altogether. As Americans were encouraged to stay home throughout March, April and May, foot traffic all but vanished across America for months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though some states have begun relaxing measures and stores are starting to open back up, America remains suspended in a fairly volatile market. People are worried about what the future will look like.  Many of them are strapped for cash and not willing to spend like they used to. In return, businesses are suffering and searching for ways to save. Unfortunately, one of the first things to go is often employer-sponsored benefits such as 401(k) plans or their matching contributions.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Is it Legal for an Employer to Suspend Matching Contributions?</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, it is legal for an employer to suspend matching 401(k) contributions. While it may have been an enticing addition to your benefits package upon your hiring, employers do have the power to simply stop offering this benefit. The most important thing an employer can do in this instance is to effectively communicate with employees who will be affected by the change. For example, explaining that cutting these benefits is their solution to avoiding layoffs will likely make employees more understanding and receptive to the change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your employer doesn’t provide you with an explanation or any idea of if/when contributions will start up again, speak to your manager or HR department. If your employer offers contribution matches to a safe harbor 401(k) plan, they must offer notice to employees 30 to 90 days in advance of suspending contributions.<sup><em>2 </em></sup>  </span></p>\n<h5><b>What Should You Do if Your Matching Contributions Are Suspended?</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case that your employer does suspend matching contributions, there are a few next steps you can take to help maintain and grow your retirement savings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having an employer suspend matching contributions, even if it’s only temporary, is a sign of the times. We’re facing a global pandemic, the stock market’s unpredictable and people are worried about money. If you have been personally impacted by the coronavirus, you can even withdraw up to $100,000 penalty-free as part of the recently passed CARES Act,<sup><em>3</em></sup> although this should only be done if you are in dire need of financial assistance.  Withdrawing any amount from your 401(k) now will only rob your future retirement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have questions regarding your company 401(k), please reach out to your financial advisor.  Your advisor’s sole responsibility is to help you make unbiased, educated and objective decisions about your money. Use him or her as a sounding board to voice your concerns and discuss potential paths forward. How will you make up for the missing contributions? What financial impact will this change have on your future retirement? The market is volatile and economic confidence is low amongst investors. If you haven’t already, use this as an opportunity to reevaluate your current asset allocations and investment strategies. You likely have plenty of questions regarding any changes to your 401(k) and other investments and your advisor may be able to help you identify potential areas for improvement based on your current tolerance for risk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your employer has slashed matching contributions, that doesn’t mean you still can’t contribute to your 401(k). If you have the means to do so, consider upping your contributions, for now at least, to help offset the loss of any missing contribution matches. The contribution limit for a 401(k) increased in 2020 to $19,500. If you’re over 50, you’re allowed to contribute an additional $6,500 in catch-up contributions.<em><sup>4</sup></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these challenging times, you are not alone if you find yourself working for a company that has suspended its 401(k) matching contributions.  Hopefully, these changes are just temporary, but it is necessary to plan accordingly for what is happening in the present.  Every penny counts when it comes to preparing for retirement and it is important to know how these 401(k) changes will affect your future savings.  If you have any questions about the impact this may have on your future retirement earnings and what you should be doing right now to make up for any lost funds, please <a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\">contact us</a>.  We are here to help!</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.psca.org/sites/psca.org/files/uploads/Research/snapshot_surveys/CARES%20Act%20Snapshot%20Summary.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.psca.org/sites/psca.org/files/uploads/Research/snapshot_surveys/CARES%20Act%20Snapshot%20Summary.pdf</span></a></em></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/mid-year-changes-to-safe-harbor-401k-plans-and-notices\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/mid-year-changes-to-safe-harbor-401k-plans-and-notices</span></a></em></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/</span></a></em></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19500-for-2020-catch-up-limit-rises-to-6500\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19500-for-2020-catch-up-limit-rises-to-6500</span></a></em></li>\n</ol>\n","slug":"has-your-employer-suspended-its-401k-matching-during-covid-19"}},{"node":{"title":"National 529 College Savings Plan Day","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today is Friday, May 29 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which means it’s “529 Day” or “National 529 College Savings Plan Day”.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> E</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ach year, National 529 College Savings Plan Day draws awareness to the tax-advantaged way of putting money away for education costs. To help ease the burden of student loans, some parents put money aside each year for their children&#8217;s education. 529 plans have grown in popularity over the years, however many people still remain unaware that 529 plans are even an option for education savings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what exactly is a 529 plan? 529 plans, also referred to as &#8220;qualified tuition plans,&#8221; are tax-advantaged savings plans sponsored by states, state agencies or educational institutions. Earnings are federally tax-exempt and most states exempt earnings from state income tax.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of 529 plans: Prepaid tuition plans and education savings plans. Both can be used as a way to save for a child or beneficiary&#8217;s education, but differ in their methods.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepaid tuition plans allow people to purchase units or credits at higher education institutions at current prices to be used in the future by the beneficiary. The credits are purchased for participating colleges or universities, which are usually public and in-state. However, it may be able to be used for an equal payment to private or out-of-state institutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second type of plan is an education savings plan. It serves as an investment account that can be used for future qualified higher education expenses. Similar to a Roth401(k) or Roth IRA, plans offer several investment options and funds will rise and fall based on the investment&#8217;s performance. Generally, the accumulated funds can be used at any participating college or university, regardless of its location. You can also use up to $10,000 to pay tuition at elementary or secondary schools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ways you can spend this saved money differs based on the plan. Prepaid tuition plans can be used for tuition and mandatory fees, but not room and board. Education savings plans, however, can be used for tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, computers and sometimes room and board. Technically, a person can use the funds accumulated in an education savings plan for any expense they choose, but if the funds are used for a non-qualified distribution, they are subject to income tax, a 10 percent penalty and any additional state penalties. If a beneficiary doesn&#8217;t need the funds, they can be withdrawn with the payment of income tax and penalties, although there are exceptions to the penalty fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">529 Day is a great time to review your college savings progress and if you haven’t started saving for college yet, it’s not too late!  Some states currently have different contests and incentives to try to boost interest and participation in their 529 savings programs.

However, the more you charge on your cards, the closer you may come to hitting that max limit.  If you do hit that amount, you are likely to get hit with over-the-limit fees. Before you decide to use your credit card to pay for necessities, there are alternatives to going over your max before risking having your credit limit cut or incurring unnecessary fees.  </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Can You Go Over Your Credit Limit?</b></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you can go over your credit limit, but there’s no surefire way to know how much you can spend in excess of your limit. Card issuers may consider a variety of factors, such as your past payment history, when deciding the risk of approving an over-the-limit transaction. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any approved transactions above your credit limit are subject to over-the-limit (or over-limit) fees. This </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit card fee</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is typically up to $35, but it can’t be greater than the amount you spend over your limit. So if you spend $20 over your limit, the fee can’t exceed $20.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the CARD Act of 2009, over-limit fees can’t be charged without your consent. As a result of these regulations, most card issuers have done away with over-limit fees and the default for any transactions over your credit limit may be that the transaction is simply denied.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do consent to a one-time over-limit fee, you can change your mind and opt-out at any time. However, in doing so, your card issuer will likely decline any purchases you attempt to make over your limit. Even if you opt-in to over-limit fees, transactions exceeding your credit limit may still be denied.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Should You Go Over Your Credit Limit?</b></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While spending over your credit limit might relieve some short-term problems, it can also cause long-term financial issues, including fees, debt and damage to your credit score. The best practice is to try to maintain a low credit utilization rate &#8211; avoid maxing out your card and spending anywhere near your credit limit.  If you do go over your limit, y</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ou should sit down and consider why it happened in the first place and review your budget. You should figure out what purchases caused you to spend more and whether you can make any changes to your spending habits.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Alternatives If Your Credit Limit Is Low</b></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those that may have a low credit limit or if your credit limit recently got cut, there are some options to ensure you don’t max out your spending. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve had a low credit limit for a while and currently have a stable job, you may want to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">request a credit limit increase</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This can be a good idea if you have </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good credit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (scores 670 to 739) or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">excellent credit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (scores 740 and greater) or if you haven’t updated your income in a while and make more money than what’s listed. Your card issuer may pull your </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit report</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for this request, which may cause a small, temporary ding to your credit score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if your credit limit was reduced, you may want to consider other options. Cardholders with good payment history and a stable job should call their card issuer and ask for reconsideration.  You should ask why your credit limit was cut, explain that your account is in good standing and that you have a stable source of income to pay off your bill. This may shed light on why your limit was lowered and potentially result in your credit limit increasing — though there is no guarantee. Rather than asking for a credit limit increase on the card that had a reduction, you may want to consider any other cards you have instead. If you have three credit cards and one got the limit cut, see if you can get an increase on one or both of the other two,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a history of missed payments or maxing out your cards, you are likely not a good candidate for reconsideration and don’t want to draw attention to yourself. Therefore, if you fall into one of these categories, it’s best to not try to request a higher limit.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>When To Apply For A New Credit Card</b></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardholders with only one credit card and a low credit limit may want to consider opening a new credit card, but should be aware of any potential risks. For starters, if you were recently laid off or faced a reduction in income, you may not be in the best position to be approved for a new card, and there’s no sense in adding a new credit inquiry to your credit report if your chances are low. Also, if you have a history of maxing out your card, you should be aware that more credit can lead to more debt. An additional credit limit can be helpful for affording your expenses, but it can also be harmful if you overspend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before opening a new card, give yourself clear guidelines on how you’ll use the card and stick to keeping a low credit utilization rate. When it comes time to pay your bill, make on-time payments of at least the minimum every month for all of your cards.  If you are able to do so, pay in full so that your credit score will  improve and your debt will be minimized. When applying for a new card, </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-credit-score-and-how-to-check-yours-for-free/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">check your credit score</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first to narrow down your options. Then consider cards based </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on your credit score. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these tough times, we need to be </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">responsible when it comes to spending and not see going over your credit limit as a choice. If you do need to use your credit cards to pay for utilities, groceries and other necessities right now, make sure you are aware of your max and other options you might be able to work out with the credit card companies before going over your limit. When you do receive those credit card statements, make sure to pay at least the minimum amount each month to maintain a positive credit score. And, make sure you are paying the bills on time to ensure you won’t incur any late fees either.  If you have any questions about credit, credit cards or other issues concerning your finances, please <a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\">contact us</a>.  We are all in this together and we’re here to help! </span></p>\n","slug":"what-happens-if-you-try-to-spend-more-than-your-credit-limit"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
