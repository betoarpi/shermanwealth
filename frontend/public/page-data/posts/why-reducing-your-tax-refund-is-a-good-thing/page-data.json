While you&#8217;re probably looking forward to this windfall, there are reasons why you may wish to minimize your end-of-year refund.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why Big Refunds are Bad</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taxes are refunded to you when the Government takes too much of your pay each pay period. By overpaying each paycheck, only to get the money returned to you once a year, you are essentially lending the Government money at zero percent interest. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is money that could have been budgeted for and spent, or invested, throughout the year. Even if you had put the money in a savings account over the year, you still would be better off.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How to Minimize Your Refund</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to adjust the amount that is withheld for the IRS each pay period you need to fill out/change your W-4 form.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The W-4 allows you to specify allowances or exemptions that you are eligible for.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">These can include:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Donations to charitable organizations</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interest on a home mortgage</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interest on student loan debt</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Contributions to traditional IRAs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The W-4 form estimates the amount that you would receive from a tax refund. This amount is then distributed over the number of weeks remaining in the tax year, lowering the amount withheld from your paycheck each pay period.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You should also look into filling out a new W-4 every time you have experienced a major change in your life. Examples of this include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Switching jobs</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marriage</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Having a child</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Losing a dependent (They either file their own tax return, or you can no longer claim them)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While trying to lower the amount that is withheld in taxes each pay period generally makes sense, it may be prudent to not list all of the exemptions you are eligible for on your W-4.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why You May Not Want to Claim all Your Allowances</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While having too much in taxes withheld can be compared to lending the Government money at a rate of zero percent interest, the reverse is also true. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you underpay in taxes each paycheck, you end up owing money to the Government. In theory this is great. You could put the money in a savings account, and then at the end of the year pay back the Government while pocketing the interest that you collected. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In practice however this is not a prudent strategy for most people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Individuals have a tendency to spend money that they have, and forget about longer-term consequences of their actions. Additionally while receiving a refund at the end of the year is exciting, the opposite is also true.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is why it may make sense for you to leave a few deductions you are eligible for unlisted on your W-4. This ensures that you receive a tax refund, albeit a smaller one, rather than owing money.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What to Do When You Do Receive a Refund</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While this advice can be helpful for next year, chances are this year’s tax season will provide you with a large refund.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you do receive a large refund there are a series of things you can consider to maximize its value. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Invest in yourself – Sometimes the best investment you can make is in yourself. Consider buying a book or taking a class to help improve your performance in work or at life.</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Get your will done – this can often cost less than a $1,000 in total but can save your beneficiary’s significantly more both in terms of money as well as headache</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Put money into a college savings plan </span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay down your mortgage</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Invest in a non-tax-exempt account – if you have already maxed out your IRA</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Save for a rainy day</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Open/add to an IRA</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay off student loan debt</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay off credit card debt – if you have any credit card debt, this should be an immediate priority</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Save the money and increase your 401(k) contributions – put your money in a safe place such as a savings account, and bump up your 401(k) contributions to reflect the fact that you have this money sitting on the side.</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of what you do with your tax refund, it is important that you come up with a plan. A trusted financial planner can help you in the process of creating one.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With over a decade’s worth of experience in the financial services industry <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Brad Sherman</a> is committed to helping individual investors plan and prepare for retirement.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
