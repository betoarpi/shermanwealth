In 2008, this threshold increased to cover children through age 18 and full time students through age 23.”</p>\n<h3><strong>How were Uniform Gifts and Transfers Taxed?</strong></h3>\n<p>UGMAs and UTMAs have been a popular way to save money in a child&#8217;s or grandchild’s name precisely because of their significant tax advantages. A portion of the money earned &#8211; the first $1,050 of the child’s investment income (including interest, dividends and capital gains distributions) has been tax-free; the next $1,050 has taxed at the child’s rate; and investment income above $2,100 was taxed at the parent’s or grandparent’s “marginal” tax rate, ie the highest rate applied to the last dollar earned.</p>\n<h3><strong>How is it Changing?</strong></h3>\n<p>The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made an important change to this graduated “Kiddie Tax.”</p>\n<p>Instead of a child’s investment income above $2,100 being taxed at the parent or grandparent’s individual tax rate, it will be taxed at the 2018 trust and estate tax rates:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 269px;\" width=\"831\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Investment Income</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Trust &amp; Estate Tax Rate</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Up to $2,550</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$2,551-$9,150</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$9,151-$12,500</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Over $12,500</td>\n<td>37%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>Will You Pay More or Less?</strong></h3>\n<p>How much you will pay depends on the amount of investment income and your own marginal tax bracket. As a rule of thumb, the more you have the more you may be taxed this year.</p>\n<p>While the Tax Code changed with this law, it unfortunately did not get simpler. And one alternative, if your rates are going up, may be to consider rolling the UTMA or UGMA into a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/saving-for-college-529-plans/\">529 plan</a>. Because of the complexity, it’s a good idea to speak with your Financial Planner about how the new law affects you, and what your best alternatives are now among the wide array of educational savings plans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\">give us a call</a> if you’d like to schedule a free consultation.</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v_roundrect   href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v_fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w_anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v_roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":null,"acf":null}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"the-kiddie-tax-is-changing-what-you-need-to-know-now"}}}
