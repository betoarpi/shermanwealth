(In fact, they might be worse!)  Wealthy people just tend to own most of the equity in the economy, meaning that when business does well, they reap disproportionately large benefits.  Generally speaking, rich individuals own the upside of the economy in the form of stock, while the middle class’s gains are limited by the slow growth of housing wealth.  It is no surprise that the collapse of the housing bubble has exacerbated wealth inequality because stocks recovered more strongly than real estate did.  Maybe the difference between you and the 1% is just your perception of the options available to you.</p>\n<p>Surely, shelter is one of the basic necessities of life.  Everyone has to live somewhere &#8211; but taking the time to consider all of your options before making any large financial decisions is something that every person should do.  At the very least, you should consider the opportunity costs of your cash and look into advantages of a less expensive housing option, renting, or investing more in equity to ensure that you are getting the most out of your money in the long run.</p>\n<h2>At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe that real life decisions call for real life financial planning.</h2>\n<p>These are the kinds of decisions we want to help you make, so don’t hesitate to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">contact us</a> today to get started.</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
