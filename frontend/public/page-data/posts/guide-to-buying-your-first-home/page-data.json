A home is generally the most expensive purchase you will make. Is now the right time to purchase your first home? Here are a few ideas to help guide the decision:</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate your current circumstances.</strong> A few questions to consider include: Do you plan to be in the area for 5 years or more? What would your mortgage payment be in relation to current rent? How long does it take the average home to sell? Is the housing market on an upward trend?</p>\n<p>• A good rent versus buy calculator can be found at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" title=\"Realtor.com Rent Or Buy Calculator\" href=\"http://www.realtor.com/mortgage/tools/rent-or-buy-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Realtor.com</strong></a></span></span><br />\n• Remember a house is both an investment and a home. The housing market will fluctuate. As a long term investment, you must be aware, if you need to sell quickly, can result in selling it for less than desired. A booming market can provide quick sales for a profit.<br />\n• The cost of home ownership is more than just the mortgage payment. There are maintenance costs, taxes, insurance and sometimes homeowner’s dues that need to be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Assess Your Finances.</strong> Have a good understanding of what your assets and liabilities are, and how your credit looks should be included. Meeting with a financial advisor and a lender before applying will help you evaluate your finances.</p>\n<p>• Speak with a lender about which programs you may qualify for. This will determine the down payment needed, the price range of homes you qualify for, and estimated monthly payments.<br />\n• Pull your credit report. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" title=\"Annual Credit Report\" href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>AnnualCreditReport.com</strong></a></span></span> offers a free credit report from all three credit bureaus. Get one from each bureau and check it for accuracy.<br />\n• Meet with a financial advisor to strategize your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" title=\"Financial Planning\" href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\"><strong>financial planning</strong></a></span></span> needs. Is it better to make a higher down payment, pay down debt to get your debt to income ratios lower, or leave the money invested so the lender includes this in your financial reserves? Each decision has its own merits and between the lender and your Sherman Wealth Management adviser they can help you determine the best course of action for your needs.<br />\n• Consider what you can afford. What a lender will approve you for and how much you can afford may not be the same thing. Take a close look at all your financial obligations. Being house poor and unable to save for emergencies, retirement, college or other financial goals can create a stressful situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Get a Preapproval.</strong> Once you have evaluated your finances and determined a loan program, you are ready for a pre-approval. Your chosen lender will provide this. There are two levels of pre-approval.</p>\n<p>• The loan officer can review your financial information and credit. The loan officer then makes an assessment on how much home you can buy, what down payment is required and the best loan program. He/she then provides a preapproval letter.<br />\n• The second option includes an underwriting review of your completed file. They evaluate your income, credit, and financial assets before providing a letter. Ultimately, an underwriter makes the final decision on whether a loan is granted so the second step carries more weight than the first. Having an underwriter review your file, however, may require application fees and other costs to be paid up front.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact a real estate agent</strong> and find your first home. This is the fun part of the process. Many buyers start their search online to help narrow down location and potential neighborhoods. This can save time giving you a sense of where you want to live and what is available in your price range.</p>\n<p>When searching for your home, keep these points in mind:</p>\n<p>• You can change a lot about a home, but not its location. Be sure you are within an acceptable commute to work, schools and other activities that you will be involved in on a regular basis.<br />\n• While you will be living in your home and enjoying all its features, there will come a time you will want to sell, so consider resale value in your decision.<br />\n• Do not buy the most expensive home in the neighborhood.<br />\n• The best bargains are fixer uppers. While these homes are priced lower to compensate for needed work, it takes both time and money to make repairs. Consider how you want to use your financial resources. It is sometimes better to buy a move in ready home than to use all your cash reserves on repairs.</p>\n<p>Buying a home is an exciting decision. It can result in a solid investment that appreciates over time, though this is not guaranteed. Homeownership gives you a sense of community and allows you to personalize your space in a way that renting does not. Use these tips to determine if buying a home now, is the best decision for you and your family.</p>\n<p>LFS-1061220-111714</p>\n","acf":null}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"guide-to-buying-your-first-home","rootQuery":"\n  query PostQuery($slug: String!) {\n    wordpressPost(slug: { eq: $slug }) {\n      title\n      slug\n      content\n      acf {\n        display\n        recommended_articles {\n          post_title\n          post_content\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n"}}}
