Some say it’s too overwhelming to think about. But even young, healthy adults can unexpectedly fall to illness or become involved in an accident. Ask yourself these questions:</p>\n<p>&#8211; What would happen to my child if I and my spouse suddenly died or became incapacitated?</p>\n<p>&#8211; Who will take care of your child&#8217;s medical needs and daily care?</p>\n<p>&#8211; Who will manage your assets until your child reaches adulthood?</p>\n<p>A well-crafted estate plan can both address these issues and ensure that your kids are taken care of after you are gone. That is precisely the reason young families <em>need</em> estate planning. After all, let’s not forget what happened <a href=\"https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2018/10/05/dont-let-your-clients-make-the-same-mistake-as-are/\">when Prince passed</a> with no will or estate plan in place. While most believe estate planning to be a simple routine, there are actually many things to consider when planning for the future:</p>\n<p><strong>Nominate a guardian for your children</strong></p>\n<p>As a parent of a child or multiple children, the top reason as to why you need an estate plan is to allow for the specific naming of the person who will continue to raise the children. If this is not named, the court will appoint someone. This person will not know your children, nor will they know your wishes for the future of each child.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions for the distribution of your assets</strong></p>\n<p>Typically, married couples want a majority of their assets to go to the surviving spouse if one of them was to pass away. If both parents die and the children are young, they want their assets to be used to care for their children.</p>\n<p><strong>Naming Someone to Manage Your Children’s Inheritance</strong></p>\n<p>As with guardian status, unless you specifically name someone, the court will appoint someone to oversee the inheritance going to your children. This will likely be a stranger to your family. Further, it will cost money, which will be paid from the inheritance. Most parents ask that their children inherit the assets when they are older. This allows the inheritance to stay “intact” and provide for all children under the age of 18.</p>\n<p><strong>Reviewing Insurance Needs</strong></p>\n<p>A main component of the planning process is to evaluate the amount of life insurance on both parents. Obviously, Income will need to be replaced in the loss of one, or both, parents. Additional coverage may be needed to provide for your children until they are of legal age. This amount could go up more if you wanting to pay for college for these children</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Estate planning will require you to ponder over relationships and life. This may very well lead to some difficult decisions. But a qualified financial advisor will be able to help you through this process. They can also provide valued direction and ensure your plan will do what you want if the time comes. If finances are tight, which is normal for young families, we suggest starting with the most critical legal documents and life insurance. Other aspects of the plan can be decided when the time is right. In the end, the most important thing is to not put this off. Once your plan is settled, this will bring you and your family a great deal of peace and comfort.</p>\n<p>We meet with lots of young couples and have encountered countless one-off, complex scenarios.
