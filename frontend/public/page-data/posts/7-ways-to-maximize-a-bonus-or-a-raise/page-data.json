Read these tips before you start Googling airfares to Thailand…</strong></h4>\n<p>Using a bonus or a raise to catch up in financial areas where you’ve fallen behind is a great way to jump start 2015. From paying off high interest debt to setting up a college savings plan, there are plenty of smart ways to put that chunk of change to good use.</p>\n<h4><strong>Pay off High Interest Loans</strong></h4>\n<p>It may feel impossible to escape the credit card damage you did in college or mounting loans. But you actually<em> can</em> make a dent in your debt by using your bonus for a large payment. This lowers your balance and minimizes some of those high interest charges moving forward. Get a snapshot of where you stand with the <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/debtrepayment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debt Repayment Calculator</a> from Credit Karma.</p>\n<h4><strong>Rebalance Your Investment Portfolio</strong></h4>\n<p>Those extra funds are a great reason to take a closer look at your assets and determine what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.<strong> </strong>We can help you adjust to create the right balance between return and risk, ensuring you&#8217;re pursing both long and short-term financial goals.</p>\n<h4><strong>Start a College Savings Plan </strong></h4>\n<p>Even if your kids are in diapers, it&#8217;s never too early to start saving for their college education. By starting early and using the variety of college savings programs available today, you can get a good head start on a college savings account.  There are a couple of different types of college savings savings plans and each has different features and potential tax benefits.    A financial advisor can help you determine the plan that suits your situation.  The <a href=\"http://www.collegesavings.org/gettingStarted.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">College Savings Plan Network</a> also offers great resources and tips for getting started.</p>\n<h4><strong>Think About Retiring</strong></h4>\n<p>Unless you received a<em> <strong>really</strong></em> enormous bonus, we don&#8217;t mean retire now. But if you haven&#8217;t reached your company&#8217;s 401(k) contribution limits, use your bonus to max out those weekly or monthly contributions. If your employer matches&#8230; consider that bonus doubled.</p>\n<h4><strong> Open an Investment Account</strong></h4>\n<p>Planning for the future can be daunting, especially when you have large expenses to deal with <em>now</em>. But the earlier you start investing <strong>(even low monthly contributions)</strong>, the longer your money has to grow.  Rather than let it sit in your checking account, create an investment account with your bonus to kick-start a financial safety net.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prep for an Emergency</strong></h4>\n<p>Fun? No. Smart? Yes. Unexpected issues pop up and can throw your monthly budget off track. Get prepared by setting up a fund for irregular expenses and circumstances like job loss, repairs, or costly medical bills for people and pets. A good rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses saved up for those worst-case scenarios.</p>\n<h4><strong>Save for a Rainy Day</strong></h4>\n<p>It may be tempting to book a trip somewhere warm or buy a TV that covers every square inch of your wall space. While it’s best to take care of outstanding debt and invest wisely, you deserve to have a little fun for burning the midnight oil at the office all year. Be sure to put a small portion of your bonus aside to treat yourself or your family to something special when the time is right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LFS-1094780-011215</p>\n","acf":null}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"7-ways-to-maximize-a-bonus-or-a-raise","rootQuery":"\n  query PostQuery($slug: String!) {\n    wordpressPost(slug: { eq: $slug }) {\n      title\n      slug\n      content\n      acf {\n        display\n        recommended_articles {\n          post_title\n          post_content\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n"}}}
