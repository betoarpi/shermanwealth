As Barry Ritholz noted in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/get-there/what-history-tells-us-about-your-investments-in-2017/2016/12/30/1e4c5714-cc4d-11e6-a87f-b917067331bb_story.html\">excellent piece</a> in the Washington Post last week, during President Grover Cleveland’s first term stocks rose 53 percent while in his second term they fell 2 percent. That wasn’t because President Cleveland forgot how to make stocks go up – it was overall market drivers that made a difference. So for medium and long-term goals – like saving for retirement or your children’s education – taking the long view with your investments is critical.</p>\n<h2>How Much Risk is Too Much?</h2>\n<p>The second point is that everyone has a different level of risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>That is why it’s critical that you have access to a sophisticated risk tolerance tool that really drills down to who <em>you</em> are, instead of only generic questions about age, income and whether or not you call yourself “aggressive” or “cautious.”</p>\n<p>If you’re risk adverse and you’re anxious about a crash or a downward trend that may affect your short term plans, you can always use January to re-balance your portfolio and lock in profits. As a wise investor once said: “no one ever lost money taking a profit.” If your risk tolerance is higher, you can view the volatility as an opportunity to maximize the possible potential for your investments. By continuing to contribute regularly to a savings or investment plan, you take advantage of the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/#sthash.URdSwiaq.dpuf\">dollar-cost averaging and compounded interest</a> to make your money work for you. If you had sold in the sharp downturn last January, for instance, instead of sticking to your plan, you would have lost out on the dramatic returns afterwards.</p>\n<p>Of course every January is a good time to meet with your advisor to rebalance your portfolio based on your own changing circumstances, tax needs, and risk tolerance. But, fundamentally, your plan is still <em>your</em> plan, no matter who wins the presidential election. Your goals are still <em>your</em> goals and compound interest <em>still</em> compounds. If you have worked with a good – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\">fiduciary, fee only &#8211; financial advisor</a> to create a workable plan based on <em>your</em> life goals and <em>your</em> circumstances, then staying the course – with minor adjustments – is very often the smartest plan. Data overwhelmingly shows that it’s “slow and steady” investing &#8211; not playing a guessing game by jumping in and out of investments &#8211; that ultimately wins the race.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Sources:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\">What is a Financial Plan?</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-importance-of-personal-finance-knowledge/\">The Importance of Personal Finance Knowledge</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-for-millennials/\">Financial Planning for Millennials: Overcoming the Fear Factor</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/112116/problem-buy-low-sell-high-advice/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
