This is commonly referred to as behavioral finance. As part of a two-part series on Behavioral Finance, we will start by exploring the different personality types of most investors. When it comes to money and investing, there are many factors that contribute to the “how” and “why” of important financial decisions.</p>\n<h2>Investor Personality Types</h2>\n<p>There are four different types of investors, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/pwmn.v2012.n1.5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFA Institute</a>, each with their own distinct behavioral biases. Understanding your own investor personality type can go a long way toward helping you determine and meet your long term investment goals, as well as producing better returns. (For more from Brad Sherman, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\"><em>6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Which of these profiles best describes you?</p>\n<h2>Preservers</h2>\n<p>Preservers are investors who place a great deal of emphasis on financial security and on preserving wealth rather than taking <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\">risks</a> to grow wealth. Preservers watch closely over their assets and are anxious about losses and short-term performance. Preservers also have trouble taking action for fear of making the wrong investments decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Preservers:</strong> An investment strategy should take into account short-, mid- and long-term goals. By overemphasizing short-term returns, an investor risks making an emotional decision based on the short-term performance, which may end up being more detrimental to them in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Accumulators</h2>\n<p>Accumulators are investors who are interested in accumulating wealth and are confident they can do so. Accumulators tend to want to steer the ship when it comes to making investment decisions. They are risk takers and typically believe that whatever path they choose is the correct one. Accumulators have frequently been successful in prior business endeavors and are confident that they will make successful investors as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Common issue with Accumulators:</strong> Overconfidence. We recently wrote a blog on the issue with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock picking</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">active management.</a> Overconfidence is a natural human tendency. As investors, accumulators consistently overestimate their ability to predict future returns. History has shown that it is impossible to predict markets at large scale, yet accumulators continue to try and do so and expose themselves to extreme risk.</p>\n<h2>Followers</h2>\n<p>Followers are investors who tend to follow the lead of their friends and colleagues, a general investing fad, or the status quo, rather than having their own ideas or making their own decisions about investing. Followers may lack interest and/or knowledge of the financial markets and their decision-making process may lack a long-term plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Followers:</strong> The herd mentality is a concept of investors piling into the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/diversification-gluten-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same investments as others</a>. This is often the basis of investment bubbles and subsequent crashes in the stock market. When you are a follower, you are typically following fund managers who have tools and recourses to act on new information in a fraction of a second. By the time the average investor “follows” them into a position, it is often too late. It is always important to understand your investment decisions and how they fit into your overall plan.</p>\n<h2>Independents</h2>\n<p>Independents are investors who have original ideas about investing and like to be involved in the investment process. Unlike followers, they are very interested in the process of investing, and are engaged in the financial markets. Many Independents are analytical and critical thinkers and trust themselves to make confident and informed decisions, but risk the pitfalls of only following their own research.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Independents:</strong> Similar to overconfidence bias associated with accumulators, independents face similar issues with relying too heavily on their own train of thought. We as humans have ability to convince ourselves that we are correct or that we don’t need guidance, even when that is not the case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
