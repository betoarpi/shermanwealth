Nearly every student is eligible for some form of financial assistance, however if you wait, there may be less money available so your aid may be in the form of more loans and less grant.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some other helpful tips to guide you through the process of figuring out just how much school you can afford.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Calculate your Expected Family Contribution (EFC).  See <a href=\"http://collegeboard.org\">collegeboard.org</a> and search “EFC Calculator.” This is a measure of your family’s financial strength and is calculated according to a law-established formula.  It takes into account your family’s taxed and untaxed income, assets and benefits and uses your most recent tax returns as of the day you file the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAFSA) and/or CSS Profile (</span><a href=\"https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). You can then use this information to estimate potential aid from schools.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use College Navigator (<a href=\"http://nced.ed.gov/collegenavigator\">nced.ed.gov/collegenavigator</a>) to search for schools.  You can compile a comprehensive list based on your student’s criteria (location, scores, majors offered, net price, etc.).  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use your EFC to estimate need-based aid.  Once your child has a preliminary set of schools, you can research the total cost and the estimated aid they can expect to receive by looking at the College Board’s website under each school’s “Paying” and “Financial Aid by the Numbers” tabs.  You can also use the net price calculator for each school which takes into account more in-depth information.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also the option of merit-based aid, but this should be researched for each school.  Not every school offers merit-based aid and for those that do, some are dependent on need, may apply to in-state students only or could be contingent on strict academic requirements.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These steps can assist you in navigating the college search process and can help ensure that the schools your child is applying to are financially feasible.  Even though most students are likely to graduate with some student loan debt after college, including financial aid research in their initial college search can be a helpful tool in minimizing these loans and after-college debt.  For help with college financial planning, please email us or schedule a <a href=\"https://go.oncehub.com/BradSherman\">free 30 minute introductory call</a>.  </span></p>\n","featured_media":null,"acf":null}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"how-to-pay-for-college-your-financial-aid-checklist"}}}
