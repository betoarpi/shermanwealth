As everyone becomes more comfortable with financing and credit, there is a greater risk that accumulated debt will never be paid off in full.</p>\n<p><em>&#8216;Younger people are taking on debt at a higher rate and paying it off at a lower rate,&#8217; says Lucia Dunn, an economics professor at Ohio State University who has studied consumer debt. &#8216;When they reach age 75, the debt picture for them will look a lot different than what we currently see.
