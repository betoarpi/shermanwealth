Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades.</p>\n<p>As frustrating as this is for first time investors, it has also inspired the creation of the new robo-advisors, as well as a new breed of smaller independent RIAs, like Sherman Wealth Management (“SWM”).</p>\n<p>Younger, breakaway firms like SWM aren’t looking for “efficiencies” or working for sales commissions on the products we recommend. Our focus is different. We strive to help investors build a strong foundation then grow with them, not by profiting off the trades, good or bad, we recommend for them.</p>\n<p>Where large brokerages currently see a “revenue problem,” we see a growth potential and are building long-term lasting relationships. By the time Wells Fargo and the other firms with traditional models get around to investing their time and attention in younger investors, it may just be too late. Those Millennial clients will be growing their wealth with firms that didn’t “ghost” them and, like Jack – spoiler alert! – may end up being “frozen out” of the largest wealth transfer in the history of the world as capital shifts from Boomers to Millennials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
