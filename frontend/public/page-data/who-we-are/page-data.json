Keaton – the money-savvy kid played by Michael J. Fox on “Family Ties” – was his role model. When he then turned a dollar his grandmother had given him into five – and then fifty – dollars, it was clear he had an aptitude for smart saving, investing and wealth preservation!</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">A frequent media contributor to such publications as The Wall Street Journal, CNBC, MarketWatch, Business Insider, and Investopedia, and the co-host of Launch Financial, a weekly podcast, he has a BA in International Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and MSF in Finance from American University’s Kogod School of Business.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Born and raised in Rockville, Maryland, Brad enjoys a strong connection to his community and contributes to a variety of organizations including The Rockville Chamber of Commerce and the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington.</p>\n<p class=\"font_2\">In his spare time he relaxes with football – both real and fantasy, baseball – especially his beloved Nats, and spending time with his two young children.</p>\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"who-we-are","template":"page-about.php","rootQuery":"\n  query AboutPageQuery($slug: String!) {\n    wordpressPage(slug: { eq: $slug }) {\n      title\n      slug\n      content\n      template\n      acf {\n        hero {\n          text\n          image {\n            localFile {\n              childImageSharp {\n                fluid(maxWidth: 1200) {\n                  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n        team_members_grid {\n          wordpress_id\n          post_excerpt\n          post_title\n          post_status\n          post_name\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    allWordpressWpTeam {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          featured_media {\n            localFile {\n              childImageSharp {\n                fluid(maxWidth: 800){\n                  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n          title\n          wordpress_id\n          acf {\n            title\n            team_member_bio\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n"}}}
