Will the market go up or down? Is that investment a winner or a loser? Did I buy at the top or the bottom? While these questions can sometimes be good to ask, they&#8217;re almost impossible to answer without the benefit of hindsight.</p>\n<p>When entering the world of financial budgeting and saving, it&#8217;s far more productive to focus on those things that you can control, like the amount you save every month. The amount of money that you save on a regular basis is one of the biggest factors in whether or not you&#8217;re able to enjoy a long and happy <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-independence-retirement/\">retirement</a>.</p>\n<p>Many people believe that they don&#8217;t make enough money to save on a regular basis. Very often, though, the problem isn&#8217;t that they don&#8217;t make enough money, but rather that they spend too much money. They don&#8217;t have a budget to control their spending.</p>\n<p>A budget is a powerful tool that can boost your savings efforts and transform your financial future and your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">retirement planning</a>. It gives you a clear view into your spending habits, so you can make changes where needed.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Using a Financial Budget</h3>\n<p>It allows you to see and track your spending, so you can tell if you&#8217;re making progress towards your goals.<br />\nIt gives you the information you need to make wise spending decisions. Can you really afford that night out on the town or should you stay in for the weekend?</p>\n<p>It helps you better understand your trouble areas. It&#8217;s likely that you spend frivolously on a few certain items. When you use a budget, you can isolate that spending and work to reduce it.</p>\n<p>At Sherman Wealth, we work with concerned savers like you every day, and help them retake control of their financial future. We can help you establish a budget that fits your income and lifestyle. We then help you stick to that budget so you can pursue your savings goals and enjoy the confident financial future you envision</p>\n","template":"","acf":null}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"budgeting-and-saving","template":"","rootQuery":"\n  query PageQuery($slug: String!) {\n    wordpressPage(slug: { eq: $slug }) {\n      title\n      slug\n      content\n      template\n      acf {\n        content_blocks_page{\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_intro_section {\n            intro_text\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_regular_content {\n            content_text\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_two_columns {\n            two_columns {\n              column_left\n              column_right\n            }\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_three_columns {\n            three_columns_block {\n              column_left\n              column_middle\n              column_right\n            }\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_four_columns {\n            four_columns_block {\n              column_left\n              column_middle_left\n              column_middle_right\n              column_right\n            }\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_featured_content {\n            featured_content_block {\n              content\n              image {\n                source_url\n                id\n              }\n            }\n            id\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n"}}}
