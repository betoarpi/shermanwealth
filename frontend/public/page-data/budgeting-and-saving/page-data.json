While these questions can sometimes be good to ask, they&#8217;re almost impossible to answer without the benefit of hindsight.</p>\n<p>When entering the world of financial budgeting and saving, it&#8217;s far more productive to focus on those things that you can control, like the amount you save every month. The amount of money that you save on a regular basis is one of the biggest factors in whether or not you&#8217;re able to enjoy a long and happy <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-independence-retirement/\">retirement</a>.</p>\n<p>Many people believe that they don&#8217;t make enough money to save on a regular basis. Very often, though, the problem isn&#8217;t that they don&#8217;t make enough money, but rather that they spend too much money. They don&#8217;t have a budget to control their spending.</p>\n<p>A budget is a powerful tool that can boost your savings efforts and transform your financial future and your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">retirement planning</a>.
