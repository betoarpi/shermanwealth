Today we learn how ineritance works when it comes to airline miles being passed to family members, and how the airlines make it difficult. We take a look at data behind the changing real estate market in Phoenix, and how it&#8217;s being shaped Zillow. Rising construction costs are depressing land values, slowing D.C.&#8217;s values.
