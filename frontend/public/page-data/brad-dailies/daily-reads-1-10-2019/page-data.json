That’s less than any year since 2008. The bid-to-cover ratio, as it’s known, fell even as benchmark Treasury yields soared to multi-year highs in October, before falling back to their lows last month.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.financial-planning.com/news/with-memories-of-housing-crash-older-millennials-prefer-stocks\">With memories of housing crash, older millennials prefer stocks</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PCentopani\"><strong>@</strong>PCentopani</a></p>\n<p>How people view the best way to build their wealth — real estate vs. stocks — was partly influenced by their age when the crisis happened. Indeed, the 35-44 year-old range was prime home buying age when the housing bubble popped, likely explaining why 52% prefer putting money in the stock market. Every other age range viewed real estate as the better investment of the two.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/china-apple-others-flash-warning-sign-economy-2019-1-1027856231?nr_email_referer=1&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=opening_bell&amp;utm_campaign=post%20blast%20%28moneygame%29:%2010%20things%20you%20need%20to%20know%20before%20the%20opening%20bell&amp;utm_term=10%20things%20before%20opening%20bell\">A growing number of companies are flashing a warning sign on China&#8217;s economy</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ginaheeb\"><strong>@</strong>ginaheeb</a></p>\n<p>Apple rattled global markets last week as it cited cooling activity in China as a risk to revenue, underscoring expectations for the second-largest economy to lose steam.
