Cook blamed much of the shortfall on China, where the company underestimated a decelerating economy. The company saw a decline in sales of iPhones, Macs and iPads in the country. Cook cited macro factors like trade friction between the US and China, the world&#8217;s two biggest economies. &#8220;We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States,&#8221; Cook said.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-03/companies-in-u-s-added-271-000-workers-in-december-adp-says\">Firms in U.S. Hired Most Workers Since Early 2017, ADP Says</a> from @ShoChandra</p>\n<p>“Businesses continue to add aggressively to their payrolls despite the stock market slump and the trade war,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/manhattan-apartment-median-price-below-1-million-first-time-3-years-2019-1-1027840575\">The price of a typical Manhattan apartment just fell below $1 million</a> from @ginaheeb</p>\n<p>The median sales price of units sold in the borough fell nearly 6% from the same period last year to $999,000 from October to December, according to a report from listing broker Douglas Elliman Real Estate, the lowest since 2015.
