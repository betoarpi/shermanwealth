Growth in 2019, the fund said, will be 3.5% globally, while next year it will come in at 3.6%. These figures, released on the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, compare to 3.7% and 3.8% respectively at the last release.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-consumer-strong-as-economy-slows.html\">US consumer is ‘very strong’ even as the world economy sees a ‘synchronized slowdown’</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Matt_Belvedere\"><strong>@</strong>Matt_Belvedere</a></p>\n<p>Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan told CNBC on Tuesday the American consumer remains confident despite headwinds in the United States and around the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/dow-today-1-22-2019/index.html\">Wall Street is ignoring &#8216;childish behavior&#8217; of Washington — for now</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattEganCNN\"><strong>@</strong>MattEganCNN</a></p>\n<p>Wall Street doesn&#8217;t seem rattled by the longest government shutdown in American history. The S&amp;P 500 has spiked more than 10% since the shutdown began on December 22. Stocks have been lifted by hopes that the United States will avoid an imminent recession, the Federal Reserve will slow its rate hikes and the US-China trade war will ease.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PERSONAL FINANCE</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-the-postcard-sized-form-1040-could-simplify-your-life-and-save-you-money-on-tax-prep-2019-01-15?mod=personal-finance\">How the new Form 1040 could simplify your life and save you money on tax prep</a> from  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarketWatch\"><strong>@</strong>MarketWatch</a></p>\n<p>The IRS has released the new-and-improved Form 1040 for your 2018 individual federal income tax return. The good news is the return is now postcard-sized if your tax situation is super-simple.
