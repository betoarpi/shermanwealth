If the numbers don’t match up, you’ll want to adjust your W-4, which you can do at any point during the year.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you revisit your W-4, it’s also important to keep in mind that the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/09/12/your-first-look-at-2020-tax-rates-projected-brackets-standard-deduction-amounts-and-more/#34ab9e827930\">2020 projected tax rate schedules</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to paying the right amount of tax is to update your W-4 regularly. You should revisit your W-4 whenever you have a major personal life change. As we have written in the past, the potential for both a tax bill and a tax refund should be zero, or close to it. However, if you count on a big tax refund every year, pay attention to your withholding because it directly impacts your refund.  You can adjust your W-4 at any time throughout the year, but if you do it later in the year, there will be less impact on your taxes for that year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need any assistance with your taxes or updating your W-4, you should speak to a professional.  We are happy to provide you with CPA recommendations if you would like.

Although “rollover” is a term widely used to mean moving money from one retirement account to another.  That money is best moved by direct transfer, but some employers will send a check. You have 60 days to roll that money over to an IRA or other qualified plan. If you miss that window, there is a grace period (with a penalty fee), but this is offered only once every 12 months. It’s best to do a direct transfer to avoid this becoming a problem.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Don’t assume an IRA is best.  </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of good reasons to move your money into an IRA (individual retirement account).  These accounts aren’t linked to any one employer and consolidate your money into a single retirement account.  However, your employer’s plan may offer you access to investment options, tools and institutional pricing that you might not get with an IRA.  In addition, the creditor protection for IRAs varies by state and might not be as secure as a 401(k) option.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Make sure to not overlook other tax strategies.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be other strategies to consider when weighing a job move, although most people associate 401(k) plans with pretax contribution. One option may be to convert the savings to a Roth IRA; you’ll owe income taxes on what you convert, but future growth and withdrawals will be tax free. If your income is lower that year, the tax impact will be less.  For those who’ve accumulated their employer’s stock in their 401(k) plans, leaving a job may open the door for an often overlooked tax break. Normally, distributions from a tax-deferred retirement account are taxed as ordinary income. Under the so-called “net unrealized appreciation” break, you can opt to withdraw your employer’s stock as shares. You’ll owe ordinary income tax on the cost basis, but not on any gains. When you sell the shares down the road, you’ll owe capital-gains tax just on the shares’ appreciation.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we enter the 4th quarter, and you may have received all your September 30th statements from all your old 401k plans, use this opportunity as  a good time to evaluate and understand what you have and you options. Keeping regular tabs on what is going on with your investments is critical to ensuring they line up with your goals for the future.  </span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>&nbsp; According to a recent piece in Barron&#8217;s , most Americans change jobs an average of 12 times throughout their lifetime.  Many people often make rushed decisions and think they need to pack up their savings when they leave a job.  On the other hand, some people pay no attention when they move from job [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}],"featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.5698924731182795,"src":"/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/26a4d/401k-1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/4e5cc/401k-1-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/5398f/401k-1-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/26a4d/401k-1-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/897d1/401k-1-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/57238/401k-1-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/3893c/401k-1-1.jpg 1195w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"7358a901-13d2-5fd1-b918-49dfae6ccc50","slug":"are-you-ready-for-a-recession-a-survey-says-probably-not","title":"Are you ready for a recession?

The Fed has cut rates twice this year to cushion the economy and experts are betting that there might be another cut as well when the Fed meets again in 2 weeks.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what can you do to make sure you are prepared for a recession if it were to happen?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you should pay off high-interest debts and boost your emergency savings. An emergency fund is key if an economic downturn leaves you strapped for cash or a potential loss of income.  Americans should also cut down on overall spending. You might want to consider having funds automatically put into a savings account from each paycheck.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As to be expected, those with higher incomes feel more secure about their financial position if a recession were to occur.  Those that are more comfortable financially have the ability to look ahead and tend to be more goal-oriented. Typically, those that can pay their bills without much concern also have the ability to be more mindful of their spending and can build their savings funds to better prepare in the event of a job loss or other emergency.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those living paycheck-to-paycheck, it is much more difficult to prepare for a downturn.  At a minimum, limiting any “wants” and putting aside even an extra $1 a day can be helpful is starting to build that emergency fund.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a strong financial mindset is the most important factor in trying to save for an economic downfall.  You should limit what you spend and control what you save. Being proactive about your money, instead of reactive, will put you in a better position to prepare for downside risk. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can&#8217;t tell you when the next recession will happen with any accuracy. Neither can the TV pundits or even the best economists. But we know that it will happen again. Real businesses will fail. Start with a plan based on your individual situation, prioritizing the following things:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building up emergency savings and paying off expensive debt</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximizing your professional value and prospects</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allocating your portfolio based on your goals and not on how the market is doing right now</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your priorities and the plan you make will be unique to you.

Financial stress not only leads to anxiety for many, but is also one of the key factors that can lead to conflicts in a relationship. Finding alignment on money matters should be a top priority in any serious relationship (and may help you sleep better at night as well!), but many struggle with finding ways to have these important conversations. Here are five money-related issues that anyone in a long-term relationship should avoid:</p>\n<p>1. Financial Infidelity &#8211; Dishonesty about money issues is a very common problem and is a key factor in ending a relationship. Whether lying about purchases or hiding massive credit card debt, holding back on financial information is lead to massive trust issues in any relationship. Partners should find a way to talk openly about their financial situation before it leads to problems in the future.</p>\n<p>2. Being too controlling or judgmental &#8211; Feeling like your significant other is stopping you from buying things you want can often lead to serious problems in a relationship. It is helpful to decide on an amount of money that each partner can spend with no questions asked and don&#8217;t judge the things your partner might want to purchase. Make this amount something that works within the budget of your relationship so it doesn&#8217;t lead to further issues down the line.</p>\n<p>3. Not talking about your finances regularly &#8211; Talking money might often lead to arguments, but it&#8217;s imperative not to avoid these conversations. These discussions should be about budgeting, setting joint financial goals and finding ways to agree on what to spend and save.</p>\n<p>4. Refusing to Compromise &#8211; Both partners in a relationship need to realize they might not always get their way when it comes to money. You should continue to discuss financial matters until you can come to an agreement on something that works for BOTH.</p>\n<p>5. Failing to Set Joint Financial Goals &#8211; It is extremely important for couples to set financial goals that they both agree on. If you are both in agreement on what your needs/wants are, then there is less likely to be an issue when it comes to deciding what to spend money on.</p>\n<p>The keys to successful relationships regarding financial issues are transparency, setting clear goals and compromise. Keeping the conversations flowing regarding money matters is integral to a healthy relationship. As relationships continue to change and evolve, it’s important to continue to have these discussions in an ongoing fashion. Keep experimenting with different methods until you find one that works best for you and your significant other and remember to always try to keep an open mind. These discussions might just be the key to a better night’s sleep AND a more successful and happier relationship.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>According to a recent survey, money is one of the most common reasons for both sleep loss and divorce.

(CFP) states that their new fiduciary standards will be delayed, pushing the enforcement of these important ethics back to June 30, 2020. With this news comes questions about the quality of service people can expect from those handling their money, and what this all means to them in the long run.</p>\n<p>The CFP started reviewing their standards almost four years ago, in an effort to identify areas for improvement. Their code of ethics and standards of conduct, which were approved last year, require that all CFPs and brokers act in the best interests of their clients when providing financial advice. This is in contrast to the established set of standards that only required client advocacy with regards to their financial planning. With the current rule, if a CFP is not providing elements of financial planning, then they do not need to place their clients’ interests ahead of their own<strong>. </strong>It can come as a shock to many that those tasked with handling their money are not necessarily obligated to act in the best interest of investing it.</p>\n<p>When you start to appreciate the significance of these standards or lack thereof, you can see why the CFP&#8217;s decision to delay enforcement has many concerned. Currently, the CFP has 85,000 financial advisors certified under their current standards. When you factor in that many planners with a CFP designation have multiple clients with varying amounts of money under their management, you can start to see the magnitude of all this.</p>\n<p>To be a fiduciary means to act in the best interest of your clients. To uphold the integrity of such a title means that there cannot be any motivation of profiteering off clients in the interest of personal gain. A fiduciary is always to provide advice which is in the best interest of their clients.</p>\n<p>The world of finance can be a tricky landscape to negotiate. We use money every day, and it touches upon every aspect of our life, direct or indirect.</p>\n<p>That in mind, it&#8217;s important to consider regulations that may seem distant to us at face-value, but do in fact have a genuine impact on our wellbeing. Consider all this when you assess who handles your money. Huge firms that employ many advisors with the CFP designation were in fact the ones pushing for the delayment of the new fiduciary standards, stating that many of them needed more time to make the necessary business adjustments. The fact that they must alter their business strategies in order to incorporate stricter fiduciary standards proves that they have not consistently been acting in their clients best interest all along. An independent financial planner has the advantage of weighing all the options available to their clients, without being mandated to sell internal financial products. It’s characteristics like this that uphold the definition of a fiduciary, and help maintain the integrity associated with the term. Always be sure to take the time to consider these important characteristics, so that your financial wellbeing has as much integrity as those who are handling it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc.

Whether exhausted from all the spring sports (both physically and financially) or trying to figure out what to do with the kids this summer, many of us are all in the same boat.   For those of us that work full-time or part-time, it is necessary to find coverage for our kids during the summer without breaking the bank &#8211; certainly no easy feat! Most summer camps do offer before and after care, but it’s an at an additional cost after already paying the pricey sticker price of a week of camp. For those that have a parent that stays home with the kids, there is the question of “how much camp can we justify spending on” or “what activities can we do with our kids each week without spending a fortune?”  There are no right answers to these questions, but there are ways to help reduce the stress of the financial burden of summer break. First, making a family budget that includes setting aside money for whatever your summer plans are is a MUST, and don’t forget to include some vacation funds too. Another way to save is to browse sites like Living Social, Certifikid and Groupon for deals on summer camps and other activities. There are also many great free or inexpensive options through your local recreation departments &#8211; look into classes offered at nature centers, libraries and aquatic facilities. These things may not take the  financial stress out of summer, but with a little proactive planning, you might just be able to make the costs a little easier to swallow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another of the major kid/life stressors that was a topic of conversation this past weekend is the growing cost of keeping our kids involved in sports.  A new survey finds that 27% of &#8220;sports parents&#8221; are spending $500 or more each month on their children&#8217;s activities.  Even though most of us realize our kids aren’t likely going to be the next LeBron James or Tom Brady, we still want to give them every opportunity to succeed with any sport they might have interest in. Whether that means enrolling them in specialized pitching clinics or joining the club soccer team, the bottom line is that it means spending hundreds, if not thousands, each month in registration fees, uniforms and new equipment, not to mention the gas and wear &amp; tear on our cars getting them to practice, tournaments and team-bonding events throughout the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A recent survey finds that sports parents spend twice as much time on their children’s activities than they do on financial planning. To keep money priorities straight, it is recommended that parents commit to a plan.  According to Dara Luber, senior manager of retirement at TD Ameritrade, you should “start by identifying your financial goals and creating savings buckets for each of them — your retirement, your children&#8217;s education, vacations and sports, to name a few. Be sure to fund those priorities in order of importance, putting your retirement first, Luber said. Then, have regular budget meetings with your family, so that your children understand the trade-offs of participating in costly sports programs, such as forgoing a family vacation.” There is nothing wrong with helping your son or daughter realize their sports dreams, but it definitely shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of your own retirement or understate your family&#8217;s needs,&#8221; Luber said.

We’d also love to be able to send them to whatever camp they desire, for weeks on end, but that’s not always realistic either.   Before we spend more money than necessary on these types of things, we must be honest with ourselves with what our future goals are. Teaching our children the importance of saving over spending and wants vs. needs. will benefit everyone in the family.

Powell knocked that idea, by explaining that the central bank still sees the weakness as the result of “transitory” factors, such as portfolio management services, lower apparel prices and airfares.  The Fed’s target on inflation is 2%, and the core PCE rate watched by the Fed fell to a surprising 1.6% in the first quarter.&#8221;   President Donald Trump, who earlier this week urged the Fed to cut the rate by 1 percentage point was most likely frustrated with the Fed chair as well.</p>\n<p>Since the Fed did not indicate which direction the next move may be, this is a good time to review any variable interest rates you have (student loans, etc.).

As the month of April is Financial Literacy Month, this was a great time for me to help make an impact in increasing the financial literacy among students. These students have the privilege of taking a business and finance course at the high school level. They are already much more advanced in their understanding of business operation and level of financial understanding than the majority of this country. As of 2019, 19 states require high school students to study financial literacy before earning a diploma, which is up from 17 in 2018 and 13 in 2011. It is great to see this progress year to year. At the business Pitch challenge, I listened to the students’ pitch which included a deep analysis of revenue, profit margin, and expenses of their business idea: a drone delivery service, which would deliver packages from door to door.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I encouraged the students to deepen their analysis by cutting costs through changing their business model from serving as a manufacturing company to serving as a software as a service business. This way, the company would be able to cut down on high fixed costs and focus on driving recurring revenue. The important thing to note is that the students were able to hold a discussion on cost-benefit analysis, while most high school students could not due to their limited understanding of financial metrics. Whether the Drone package delivery service would become a million -dollar company or not, these students have won the lottery by attending a school that would allow them to study finance before the rest of their peers across the country. The earlier students start to understand this material, the better. As they reach college and beyond, it is crucial that they become financially literate, which will make them financially smarter. It is crucial that young adults are able to make potentially complex decisions about student loans, mortgages, credit, and managing retirement-savings accounts. According to research studies, on average, students in states that require financial literacy courses in high school have lower credit card balances and pay for college using lower cost student loans than students living in states without this mandate. States with the mandate to incorporate financial literacy courses into the curriculum have seen an overall improvement in credit scores and a lower rate of late payments on credit cards among young adults. This shows how important it is for students to begin increasing their financial literacy as early as high school.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a financial advisory firm, Sherman Wealth is a big proponent of starting to increase financial literacy at an early age. We are excited that students in Montgomery county are working to increase their understanding of business strategy and financial information, which is what we think will help them long term.

As we wrapped up the introductory meeting, we already knew what would be uncovered as we began going over her statements.  Sure enough, we were correct. To be frank, seeing this stuff is really frustrating, especially to me, a son of a public school teacher, who learned all of this first hand.</p>\n<p>Most Americans who save for retirement at work have a basic 401(k) plan. These are offered at most companies and provide a decent selection of investment opportunities. The fees may be a little high, but these employees can build a properly diversified portfolio and it’s a win-win in the end for everyone involved. But there is a whole other sub-set of Americans who do <em>not</em> get to participate in a 401(k) plan. These include public school teachers, clergy members, employees of religious institutions or nonprofits, etc. These individuals are allowed to invest in what is known as a 403(b) plan. As a result, the people who do the most good in the world, spending their careers assisting others for below-average pay, often get screwed the most.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5165 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg 684w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1-300x125.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Value after 35 years, assuming $250 contributed monthly with an 8% average annual return.<a href=\"https://403bwise.com/healthcare/content/61\"> Source</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But it’s not their fault. They have to invest in <em>something</em>, right? And if this is their only option, what else are they to do? Most 403(b) accounts are peppered with complex, expensive products that usually cost their owners tens of thousands of dollars over their careers. How is this possible? One reason is that the 403(b) accounts that many workers contribute to are not held to the same rules and regulations as a 401(k). When these employees are told that these are approved products, they automatically assume the school district did some due diligence on it. Think again. We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the district you work in doesn’t pay any attention to these plans or products. To them, it’s just another hassle.</p>\n<p>Be wary of any adviser who takes commissions of any sort from investment or insurance companies. Ask whether any adviser your organization hires will be on call for one-on-one advice, too. We once talked to a teacher who said she literally called around to vendors in her state, looking for anything with a fee under 1.50%. What’s the worst part? No one could meet those (very simple) requirements. In fact, according to the <a href=\"https://retirementandinvestmentblog.aon.com/getattachment/36ff81a4-db35-4bc0-aac1-1685d2a64078/How_403\">analysis</a> prepared by Aon Hewitt, the average fees charged on variable and fixed annuities and mutual funds included in a 403(b) plan look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variable annuities: 2.25%.</li>\n<li>Fixed annuities: 1.15%.</li>\n<li>Mutual funds: 0.97%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By contrast, the average expense ratio of an ETF is just 0.44%. Unfortunately, ETFs <a href=\"https://www.plansponsor.com/blines-ask-the-experts-etfs-in-a-403b-plan/\">rarely appear</a> as an investment option in 403(b) plans.</p>\n<p>So, who’s fault is this? Ultimately, it falls on the individual school districts to properly vet the companies and salesman who are finding their ways into schools, like cockroaches in the night. We wrote a <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/are-managers-responsible-for-their-employees-retirement/\">piece</a> recently on why it’s an employer’s responsibility to ensure that their employees are being properly educated and informed on their retirement options. It is not the individuals responsibility to research the best choices. In all honesty, these individuals wouldn’t even know where to start in regards to due diligence between various products and funds.</p>\n<p>In the end, 403(b) plans in the modern world are outdated compared to their for-profit employer 401(k) plan peers by roughly 20 years. Most importantly, their existing multi-provider record keeper platforms, incredibly long investment menus, and inability to employ proper, institutionally-focused investment options have created an environment that impairs retirement outcomes for participants. It’s a sad reality for those who contribute to our society in such a respectable and positive way.</p>\n<p>If you are school teacher and are having trouble navigating your 403(b) plan and are unsure of where to turn for conflict free advice, please feel free to <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">reach out to us</a> and we&#8217;d be happy to assist you and any manner.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It’s very unfortunate that school teachers, arguably one of the largest value-ads to communities across this nation, are getting taken to the woodshed on their retirement options.

Five states (Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia) are the only other states to have passed a similar law. As professionals who strive to preach the importance of this topic, we are very happy to see these developments. In fact, we think it’s particularly great that we, as a nation, are beginning to demand that children learn the basic of personal finance, <em>before</em> they step out into the real world.</p>\n<p>But first off, let’s tackle what the actual definition of “financial literacy” is. Financial literacy is the combination of financial, credit and debt management and the overall knowledge that is required to make responsible decisions regarding financial matters. Really, we are talking about the impact of finances on the daily issues an average family may encounter.</p>\n<p>Is the rate of financial literacy low in the US? Yep. (Actually, it’s low <a href=\"http://gflec.org/initiatives/sp-global-finlit-survey/\">around the world</a>.) Of course, the level of financial literacy varies according to education and income levels. However, there is a lot of evidence out there that shows that highly educated individuals with above-average incomes are almost equally as under-educated on these topics as those who may live a more modest lifestyle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5154\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1199\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg 1199w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-300x101.jpg 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-1024x344.jpg 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-768x258.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px\" /></a></p>\n<p>source: <a href=\"http://gflec.org/initiatives/sp-global-finlit-survey/\">S&amp;P GLOBAL FINLIT SURVEY</a></p>\n<p>Given this information, it is becoming increasingly more important to ensure that we are preparing our children with this knowledge well before they are starting college, creating families, and living an “adult” life. Why? Because it’s about the “long game”. Financial literacy is critical in helping people plan for retirement and avoiding high levels of debt. Last year, a <a href=\"https://www.tiaainstitute.org/sites/default/files/presentations/2017-02/economic_importance_of_financial_literacy.pdf\">study from TIAA-CREF</a> showed that those with high levels of financial literacy  are more likely to make astute decisions and typically, over their lifetime, amass twice as much wealth as those without a plan.</p>\n<p>If you can’t build a simple household budget, then you are likely financially illiterate. If you are oblivious to money-related decisions, are unsure of the consequences of these decisions, or you simply don’t care, then you’re financially illiterate. Most importantly, If you have learned the “hard way” over the years that not being up-to-date on financial matters has affected your life in a negative way, it is imperative that you do not allow your children to make the same mistakes. Important financial decisions are popping up earlier and earlier in life, as the world becomes more complex. You don’t “build” wealth and <em>then</em> figure out how to manage it properly. That ability to grow comes with managing it properly along the way.</p>\n<p>The statistics mentioned above are some of main reasons we have created the &#8220;Beers with Brad&#8221; seminar series. We feel that increasing your financial literacy is incredibly important to your long term financial goals and obligations.

And to be honest, he makes a pretty compelling point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As a man who has spent his career studying human behavior, Thaler draws the conclusion that humans are predictably irrational and consistently make choices which are not in their best interest. While this seems very simple on the outside, the findings are quite complex. Here’s a great example: only 50% of US workers participate in a workplace retirement plan. While some don’t have access to this type of benefit, many do have access, and simply don’t take advantage of it. Yet, we know that saving for retirement (and taking every advantage) is the optimal route to take.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Most of us would say we make wise decisions for ourselves and our families, but the data does not back up this sentiment. Thaler has also found that people only save money if it’s automatic. Thus, he feels to most important aspects of a 401(k) offering are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Automatic enrollment</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Automatic escalation</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Good default low-cost investment options</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Helping individuals roll their 401(k) into an IRA when they change jobs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Again, this seems like a very easy concept for CEOs and managers to adopt, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. Thaler proclaims, “If the employees at your firm are not saving enough for retirement, realize that it is your fault. And that is because we know how to make saving for retirement much easier and more successful.” But since so many workers <em>aren’t</em> saving, he places the blame on the managers themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But why should you care? Because the financial wellness of your employees will affect the bottom line of your business. <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/139373/business-case-wellbeing.aspx\">A report released by Gallup</a> on the Economics of Well-being tells us that having a low sense of financial stability can lead to “stress, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, and depression”. All of these emotions lead to reduced productivity and output. And worse? Employee retention also tends to spike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Step one: HR managers and senior executives should make 401(k) participation an “opt-out” decision. This creates a wall to prevent individuals from harming themselves by passing on automatic retirement savings. Second, escalating the amount of these contributions -over time &#8211; will allow your employees to increase their savings rate. Most studies have shown that <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://thefinancetwins.com/personal-savings-rate/\">your monthly savings rate is the number one statistic</a> that will decide whether you will be able to retire on time or not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Third, it is imperative that these retirement plans have low-cost investment options for employees to choose from. Simple index funds really will get the job done. In much of his work, Thaler points to the fact that humans are consistently irrational, so nudging them towards smart investment choices is important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The key to checking off these boxes is most likely automation. Managers and CEOs have the authority to make these decisions. In theory, the financial stability of your employees (and the ability for them to <em>feel </em>that stability) is largely dependent these types of executives. However, when said managers do indeed take these steps, it’s really a win-win situation for everyone involved. Your employees’ minds aren’t elsewhere, worrying about paying the mortgage or whether they have enough saved to cover a medical emergency. Employees come to work with a clear head. They feel happier and therefore you get more production out of your employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you are a small business owner and feel that you may be spending too much on 401(k) plan costs or that your employees are bringing non-related stress into the workplace, please<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\"> feel free to reach out</a> to us.

After all, the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/02/26/raising-child-costs-233-610-you-financially-prepared-parent/357243002/\">average cost of raising a child today</a> in middle-class America is nearly $250,000, excluding college tuition expenses. These types of numbers leave many couples in “catch up” mode when it comes to their savings and retirement planning.</p>\n<p>The first step, as we all know, is creating a plan. You can’t make any headway towards debt and savings goals without a clear, executable strategy. Three big keys are: concentrate on building up your investments, boost your credit, and reevaluate your real estate needs. This is a major inflection point in your life, and thus an ideal time to consider all these topics.</p>\n<p>Regarding your savings, your cash flow is (hopefully) growing, or at least turning positive. Because you have a limited amount of time to get things in order, taking action in the areas mentioned above should be done as soon as possible, especially if any emergency funds have been drained. More parents tend to undersave and overspend while their children are still living under their roof. Here are some questions to ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do we have enough cash to make it through the next economic contraction or bear market?</li>\n<li>Is our credit card debt manageable?</li>\n<li>Are the balances in our 401(k) and IRA accounts where they need to be?</li>\n<li>Is our house “too much” for us without the children?</li>\n<li>Do they kids still need insurance?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that some of your larger expenses have come and gone, there must be a mental shift from “paying the bills” to “creating a better future”. You will need to monitor your assets more closely now, and extra money should be going more towards retirement accounts and less towards material things. There is good news for those who may be a little behind, as <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19000-for-2019-ira-limit-increases-to-6000\">the IRS has increased contribution limits in 2019</a> for 401(k) and IRA accounts.</p>\n<p>However, one key to keeping your nest empty is taking the time to educate your children on the importance of personal finance. This is a very important step in creating and maintaining a “moat” around your new-found savings. The more educated your children are on the basics of day-to-day money management, the less likely they are to need your assistance in the immediate future. These are great opportunities to preach to them about not living beyond their means, sticking to a budget, saving a little each month, and the consequences of debt.</p>\n<p>There are a few important things than can be tackled that will allow you to get off on the right foot towards rebuilding your retirement savings. The key is to capitalize on the new-found opportunities to do so. And one of those, in this moment, is a focus on your future, not your child’s future.

But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that so many workers are now reaching their third week of no pay. There are roughly 800,000 federal employees who are not receiving paychecks right now, many of whom are located right here in the DC Metro area. While some are technically on a &#8220;leave of absence&#8221;, many are being expected to work for no pay. What&#8217;s worse is that federal employees already make, on average, quite a bit less than their private sector peers. On top of this, while most workers are expecting to be paid retroactively once the shutdown is over, it’s not mandatory.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, take a look at your monthly budget and find items you can easily remove.</p>\n<p>Another helpful tip is to contact your bank. In fact, one institution headquartered here in the DC Metro, Navy Federal Credit Union,  is extending a zero-interest loan up to $6,000 with no fees and a grace period. Many banks are willing to make exceptions. Bank of America and Wells Fargo also have outreach programs that assist federal employees. Most institutions have similar processes in place for their employees that allow them to contact creditors and landlords in order to ask for assistance.</p>\n<p>Another step that federal employees can take is to proactively reach out to creditors. Best move? Develop a simple letter that explains your situation: &#8220;I am a government employee who has lost income due to the government shutdown. Due to these events, my income has been drastically reduced for the time being and I am unable to make my payment in full this month.&#8221; On top this, don&#8217;t forget to include account numbers and contact information with the letter.</p>\n<p>While filing for unemployment may seem like the best &#8220;quick fix&#8221;, that isn&#8217;t necessarily true. A large portion of these federal employees can apply for unemployment while on temporary leave of absence. Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t cover everyone. For those who are expected to report to work without pay (as mentioned above), do not qualify for these benefits. In most states (and D.C.), if you collect unemployment benefits, and then receive retroactive your pay, you will indeed be require to repay the government.</p>\n<p>If you are a government worker who participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, you may take loans from their retirement savings if the furlough is expected to last 30 days or less. You may not take the loan if your leave goes beyond that period. However, remember than once you remove money from your retirement account, that money is no long invested in the market. You will also be required to repay the money, so this should be used as a last resort.</p>\n<p>One last note to keep in mind: Be skeptical about picking up work while you are on furlough. Even though the government is shut down, you are still an employee of the federal government. Because of this, certain employment (outside the scope of your federal job)may be restricted.</p>\n<p>While these tips may bring short-term relief, the best course of action is to develop a long-term plan for these types of situations. This will be the first time that a government shutdown has extended past two pay periods, making the financial situation for many households that much tighter. No one knows how long the current shutdown will last, or when the next will arise, and that is exactly the reason to be prepared for these types of scenarios.</p>\n<p>If you are federal employee who has questions about your day-to-day income during the shutdown, and are wanting to talk to a professional, please f<a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">eel free to reach out</a> to us.

The legislation resulted in lower individual income tax rates, a doubled standard deduction and the elimination of personal exemptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5057\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg 649w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1-300x111.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As we know, taxes can be somewhat finicky: if not enough is withheld, you’ll owe money come tax time. Pay too much, and you end up with a large refund. On top that, while earning a bigger paycheck twice a month sounds awesome, it could come back to hurt you come April. With all this being said, we obviously want to be as close to zero as possible. But how do we accomplish this in a changing tax environment?</p>\n<p>Prior to 2019, it was common to withhold less from your pay if you had deductions that were itemized. However, that may no longer hold true considering the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/taxes/2019/01/08/5-popular-tax-deductions-that-took-big-hits-from-t.aspx\">standard deduction is nearly twice</a> what it previously was. Due of these new tax laws, a high percentage of households who itemized in previous years will no longer be able to do so (another reason to check up your withholding). Previous laws also allowed income earners to withhold less in taxes if you they had dependents. Going forward, these types of exemptions are gone, so those filers should review their pay stub to ensure that they’re not under-withheld.</p>\n<p>Another reason to make sure your refund isn&#8217;t &#8220;too big&#8221; is because you will, more or less, be giving the government an interest-free loan. With cash accounts now paying above 2%, that money is better off working for you in your own account. This would allow you to pay off debt, add to your savings, or a multitude of things that are better than simply giving it to the US government for a year, which <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\">we have covered before</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are retired, one option is to use your Form W-4V to withhold a flat rate from your Social Security earnings. Further, use your Form W-4P to withhold from your pension. Additionally, there are <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tax-deductions-that-are-going-away-4582165\">new limits on deductions for state and local taxes and home mortgage interest</a>, a big item for many in the DC Metro and other locales.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re feeling confused about the upcoming tax season (which is almost upon us), please <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">feel free to reach out</a> to us.

A <a href=\"http://jhrps.com/Wellness\"><span class=\"s2\">recent John Hancock study</span></a> found that 72% of us take our money worries into the workplace with us, clearly affecting more of our daily lives than we would like. That same study claims that this stress causes physical and psychological problems (anxiety, sleeplessness, etc.) for nearly 60% of us. Many will say that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/why-dont-americans-save-money/478929/\"><span class=\"s2\">American’s simply cannot afford to save money</span></a> anymore. Medical expenses are high. Housing is expensive. Short-term burdens make it hard to plan for long-term goals. Many work at a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Rising number of single-parent households. The list is endless. And trust me, I get it. I totally understand these hurdles can be intimidating.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But at the end of the day, these are all just excuses. Just like they were excuses last year and the year before that. We constantly spend our time fretting over these topics, but ironically never put a plan together to actually get ahead. It’s the same scenario as the person who feels they are overweight, goes to the gym for two weeks each January, and then eventually gives up on their weight loss plan. You need a plan. And better yet, you need someone that is going to hold you accountable to that plan. Without a well-established roadmap, how are you going to reach your final destination? No one ever accomplished anything without executing a plan! And it’s not just about a retirement plan. Having a plan for weekly and monthly expenses will build the mental consistency that is required for longer term goals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don’t let 2019 be another year of day-to-day stress, secretly praying that no unexpected expenses pop up between now and your next paycheck. It’s a vicious cycle that is hard to remove yourself from unless you come up with a concrete plan of action and stick with it. Making more money is not the key to living a financially stress-free life. It can help, sure. But with out a plan you will eventually fall back into the same, undisciplined routine. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are having trouble developing a plan or are unsure where to start, <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\">please feel free to reach out to us</a>.

The market tends to have large, upward swings on positive news regarding the US-China debacle, but they are short-lived, as many feel these positive updates simply fall into the “boy who cried wolf” category at this point. We may not see a sustained move in either direction (up or down) until some kind of formal agreement has been reached between the two parties.</p>\n<p>To add to the worries, signs from abroad have not been much better. British Prime Minister Theresa May has fallen on tough times in regards to her Brexit battle, now fighting for her own political life. This week, a right-wing faction in her own party triggered a “no confidence” vote following May’s decision to postpone the debate over a deal that could have finally brought closure to the issue as a whole, which initially arose over two years ago. In China, weak economic data shows that the trade tensions are severely affecting their economy, with weaker than expected industrial output and retail sales numbers. On top of this, the reports out of Europe weren’t any better. In fact, the German and French private sectors (arguably the two most important in the Eurozone) are trending downwards in terms of growth. Further, Italian debt issues keep the country on the brink of recession. Despite the headline worries and weak economic showings in foreign economies, the US data continue to produce strong numbers, although some areas are starting to slow. Retail sales remain high, while manufacturing and service sectors output fell to new lows. We are still in an expansion, albeit at a slower than what we have been accustomed to over the past few years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Where is Bitcoin?</p>\n<p>Last year’s favorite asset, Bitcoin, is now down over 70% on the year, back to the $3300 area we saw last July 2017.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4776\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"845\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png 845w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1-300x176.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1-768x451.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If your goals for your assets have changed, if you believe your risk tolerance may not be in line with the drawdown you’ve seen in your portfolio recently, or if you just want to talk about your individual situation this is a great opportunity to <a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">let us know</a>.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Domestic markets endured another uneventful week, with two of the three major US indices posting losses over 1% for the period.

First off, crude oil prices have fallen from $76 to $50 per barrel recently, which should cause some relief at the pump for consumers. In fact, national gasoline <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/12/07/gas-prices-reach-new-2018-low/\">prices fell to $2.46/gallon</a>, a new low for 2018. A main cause of the lower prices has been the massive over-production here in the US. On the other hand, natural gas prices have seen a large spike over the last few weeks, in large part due to the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/natural-gas-prices-have-surged-over-the-last-month-heres-why.html\">lowest stockpiles of gas</a> in nearly a decade. So, while you may be saving money when you fill up your car for a long road trip over the holidays, you may see a higher natural gas than usual as we go further into the winter months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4769\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"843\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png 843w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1-300x177.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1-768x452.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you are feeling a little antsy over the recent market volatility, I would like to bring your attention to the chart below. The average intra-year drop on the S&amp;P 500 is roughly 14%. So far this year we have experienced two declines, one of 12.8% (January &#8211; February) and one around 11.3% (October). Both are below the average. These types of swings are experienced on an annual basis. Due to the fact that 2017 was such a low volatility year (as mentioned above), recency bias has kicked in and has many believing that the 2018 environment is seeing above-average fluctuations. It is not.

Probably not something your advisor has taken the time to explain to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A capital gains distribution is a payment to shareholders that is prompted by a fund manager&#8217;s liquidation of underlying stocks and securities in a mutual fund or derived from dividend and interest earned by the fund&#8217;s holdings minus the fund&#8217;s operating expenses. Further, </span><span class=\"s2\">these distributions must be made</span><span class=\"s1\"> because tax law dictates that substantial portion of investment income and capital gains must be paid to investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“But my return on the fund is essentially flat (or negative) for the year. Why is the distribution so high?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Again, this is one of the most frustrating things about mutual funds and why they are, for the most part, terribly inefficient from a tax perspective. Regardless of how long the investor owned the fund, the distributions are taxed based on how long the fund itself held the sold holdings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Can you imagine owning a fund that returned 1-2% in 2018 and being told you are going to get hit with a 10% (or even larger in some circumstances) taxable event? It’s not even your choice. Was your “buy and hold” game plan specifically built to be tax-conscious? Well, maybe in theory it was. But reality is different. Even many Vanguard mutual funds are paying massive distributions in 2018. This is a big deal for investors with assets in accounts that aren’t a 401(k) or IRA.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In an <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/890938/more-tax-pain-for-some-mutual-fund-shareholders-in.html\">excellent piece</a> by Christine Benz earlier this month, she points to the fact that “many mutual funds are likely to dish out capital gains distributions that are on par with&#8211;or even higher than&#8211;years past adds insult to injury.” Mutual funds that need to raise cash can sell profitable investments and create capital gains for investors, even if the fund has performed poorly. This means you can lose money on an investment in a mutual fund but still end up owing taxes. As I mentioned above, capital gains in a mutual fund get passed along to its investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> An <a href=\"https://www.etftrends.com/etf-strategist-channel/etfs-tax-time/\"><span class=\"s2\">interesting article</span></a> put out by ETF Trends states that ETFs have tax efficiency built into the structure. The “exchange traded” attribute of the ETF structure allows investors to purchase and sell shares without creating or redeeming small odd-lots. This is very different from mutual funds where every day mismatched buyers and sellers force transactions and tax implication in the underlying fund. The tax implications from these transactions become liabilities to those still holding the mutual fund shares. Furthermore, the creation and redemption process, which allows for in-kind transaction with Authorized Participants (APs) can further reduce the likelihood of creating a distributable capital gain in the ETF structure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With all this said, I again point to the fact that ETFs, particularly from a taxable income standpoint, are much more optimal for investors over the long term. There are plenty of other arguments (closet indexing, high(er) fees, diversification, etc.) of why we continue to promote the use of ETFs over mutual funds, but tax consequences are by far one of the top reasons we advise clients to steer clear. Forget Sharpe Ratios and standard deviation statistics, if you want to talk about risk…it’s simply not worth the risk of getting hit by a major taxable event. Remove those possibilities from your game plan and look to ETFs as the proper vehicle to reach the goals you’ve set for your portfolio.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you would like to have your portfolio analyzed for fees and tax efficiency schedule a time to chat with us <a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">here </a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Well, it’s that time of year again.

Talking about and managing finances together","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money woes are the leading cause of divorce in American couples. Over ⅓ of people in the United States have stated that financial pressure was the biggest challenge their marriage has faced in the past, and ¼ of Americans have said most of their arguments are money-related. As a financial planner, I work with a lot of couples &#8211; and I’m always surprised by how few of them have actually had an honest conversation about their money. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old saying holds true when it comes to household finances &#8211; communication is key. When you work toward creating a financial plan with your spouse, you need to talk to each other about expectations, frustrations, and any goals or dreams you may have. That being said, money conversations can also be incredibly uncomfortable &#8211; which is probably why so many American couples avoid them altogether. Knowing what you’re walking into, and how to best talk about money with your spouse ahead of time, can help you have a productive conversation. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know Yourself and Know Your Spouse</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to point fingers when it comes to money because it’s frustrating to admit our own faults. We may be harboring some guilt around unhealthy spending habits, or be embarrassed because we don’t know as much as we think we should about saving for retirement. On the other hand, our money mindset may be a direct result of how we were raised &#8211; and it may be different from how our spouse approaches their finances. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding where you fall down when it comes to your personal finances is key in order to talk to your spouse about building a financial plan that’s going to work for your family. When you know your own flaws, you’re able to create a plan of action that helps you to stay on track &#8211; which is something your spouse will appreciate. It’s also important to understand your spouse’s money mindset, as well as their financial strengths and weaknesses. Having a clear understanding of how each of you approach financial decisions, or value your money will help you to align your vision for the future (and avoid arguments down the road).</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approach Financial Opinions With No Judgement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal finance is always emotionally charged. Everyone has opinions on how money should be handled, and often they differ dramatically &#8211; even between an otherwise compatible couple. Money conversations between two spouses who have different opinions </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">money can evolve into arguments quickly. The key is to approach all financial opinions your spouse may hold without judgement. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, this sounds easy &#8211; it’s not. For example, if you firmly believe in paying down debt and living a debt free lifestyle, but your spouse sees the benefit in carrying some debt and would prefer to prioritize saving before debt repayment &#8211; you may find yourself falling into the trap of judging them for their opinion because you strongly believe that yours is “right.” The truth is, when it comes to money, there are no “right” opinions. Opinions are just that &#8211; opinions. They’re based on a value set and history that someone has with their personal finances. They aren’t fact, and they aren’t “wrong.” Knowing that your spouse’s financial opinions aren’t right or wrong (and neither are yours) can help you move through conversations without assigning emotional value to their ideas.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also important to avoid judgement of each other’s financial past. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/27/1-in-8-divorces-are-caused-by-student-loans.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 in 8 divorces</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are directly caused by student loan debt. The pressure that hefty debt, a lack of savings, or other financial missteps you bring to the table can potentially alienate your spouse. Working together to be on the same “team” when it comes to addressing these money woes is key.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set Goals Together</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you’re discussing your family’s finances, you’re going to come to a point where you need to set goals that you’re working toward. It’s tempting to set individual goals and work independently toward them, but that’s a recipe for financial dissonance in your household. Talking through your money goals, and working to align them with the values you share as a couple, can help you lay a foundation of financial peace in your home. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you set financial goals together as a married couple, you’re actively working to approach your money situation as a team. You’re building a safety net that protects both of you, planning for the lifestyle you want as a unit, and staying honest with one another. Once you’ve set goals as a team, you can move forward with creating a game plan that puts you on the path to reach those goals. This might mean creating a household budget, setting up automatic payments to knock out your debt or build up your savings, or building in “rewards” like a date night once you hit smaller milestones on your way to your long-term goals. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re struggling to find common ground when it comes to your  money, </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talking to a fiduciary, fee-only financial advisor can help</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. An impartial third party can often guide you in taking the emotion, or blame, out of your personal finances and help get you and your spouse on the same team when it comes to your money. </span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Money woes are the leading cause of divorce in American couples.

And of the people who are using their HSA, only a few of them are contributing the maximum amount each year. This gap is largely because not everyone knows about HSAs or their many benefits. As is usually the case with personal finance, the more you know, the better decisions you’re able to make. So let’s take a minute to break down what, exactly, an HSA is and how you can use it to your benefit.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is an An HSA?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An HSA, or Health Savings Account, is attached to High Deductible Health Plan insurance coverage (HDHP). In order to open an HSA, you have to be enrolled in HDHP insurance. The HSA is intended to offset the high medical costs often associated with HDHP insurance coverage &#8211; which has a high deductible (hence the name), and puts group members in a position where they have to pay out of pocket for most non-essential care services until their deductible is met. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your HSA is funded with pre-tax money, and it grows tax free.. More importantly, it rolls over from year to year, so you’re continually growing your funds without feeling pressured to use them immediately. Keep in mind that your HSA funds can only be used for qualifying medical expenses. This can include everything from doctor copays to hospital bills to a box of bandaids from your local grocery store. Putting money aside into an HSA helps to lower your taxable income while still preparing for a medical emergency, or even just offsetting smaller medical expenses &#8211; like taking your kids to the doctor. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know What You Can Contribute</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because contributions to your HSA lower your taxable income, it’s a good idea to contribute as much as you can. The current contribution limits are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$3450 if you’re single</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$6900 for a family</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add an extra $1000 to either of those figures if you’re over 55 years old</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people use their HSA to save for larger medical procedures &#8211; like having a baby, or intensive surgery. Others use it to put money aside for rising medical costs during retirement. Knowing what you can contribute is the first step to understanding what the best way to use your HSA might be. Some employers even offer a program where they assist in contributing to your HSA &#8211; which increases the total amount you’re able to save for future medical costs. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HSAs and HDHP insurance plans were originally created in hopes that if an insured individual was forced to spend their own funds on health related costs, they’d spend wisely. While this logic might work for some, others have figured out how to work the system to their advantage and use their HSA for several different financial planning purposes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To save for upcoming medical costs like cold medicine, doctor visit copays, or medical procedures</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To save for future medical costs during retirement</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To lower their taxable income</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an investment vehicle</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember: You Own Your HSA</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you create a plan for your HSA funds, it’s important to remember that you own them, not your employer. Even if you set up the account through your employer originally, you get to take that account with you wherever you choose to work in the future (or into your retirement). That’s why researching your HSA provider to ensure you’re getting the benefits </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> want is critical. It’s also important to remember that you won your HSA &#8211; and get to decide what happens to the funds in the account. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means you can decide whether you want your HSA funds to remain all-cash, or if you want to invest all or a portion of them. Additionally, you get to decide who the beneficiary is on your account, and if you want to proceed with a one-time roll over or transfer of funds from your IRA to your HSA. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think Smart &#8211; Protect Yourself</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like to view an HSA as an added layer of protection for clients. Putting money aside in an HSA has clear tax benefits, and it’s handy to have when you hit retirement. More than that, though, clients who contribute to an HSA because they’re enrolled in a high-deductible insurance plan are protecting themselves against the unknown. As a financial planner, I talk a lot about building an emergency savings and thinking about your future. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially true for </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/entrepreneurs-separate-biz-and-personal-finances/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entrepreneurs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or young families who are working to pay down debt, grow their retirement savings, and reach other financial goals &#8211; like purchasing a home. Your HSA is an added layer of insulation against the inevitable. Eventually, something will go wrong with your health (or a family member’s health).  In our case it has helped with medical bills for the kids and recently my cardiologist appointments (dont worry everything is fine). </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not uncommon for people to go into massive amounts of debt trying to pay off thousands of dollars of hospital bills after a car accident, or when their kid breaks their arm, or because they’ve been hit particularly hard by flu season. Don’t let the unexpected force you to sideline your big-picture financial goals. Regularly contributing to an HSA, or finding another way to set money aside for medical expenses, can help keep you on track.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>&nbsp; You’ve likely heard that having an HSA can help you to lower the cost of your medical care &#8211; but studies have shown that only 17% of people enrolled in group health plans are using their HSA.

While it’s not hard to imagine going into debt living in the DC metropolitan area, it is surprising to think that we may be investing our money more wisely than someone appointed to the highest judicial bench in the land.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brett Kavanaugh’s story unfortunately is not unique. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/heres-how-many-americans-have-nothing-at-all-in-savings.html\">According to a CNBC</a> article 35% of all adults in the U.S. have only several hundred dollars in their savings accounts and 34% of Americans have NO savings at all.  Even 40% of Baby Boomers are not ready for retirement. This shouldn’t be shocking when you look at the savings accounts (or lack thereof) for the vast majority of Americans. According to the EPI, nearly half of families have no retirement account savings at all, including IRAs and 401(k)s. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The median retirement account for U.S. families is just $5,000. Even older workers who can see retirement on the horizon aren&#8217;t prepared for it. The median savings for families whose wage earners are between 50 and 55 is only $8,000. For those who are between 56 and 61, it&#8217;s $17,000.  That’s not anywhere near enough money to get you through your golden years. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The good news is that this crisis can easily be rectified with self-discipline.  If you can commit to saving only 6% of your salary, or 3% with a match by your employer, you will be able to see the money add up over time. Using a $76,000 annual salary as a basis for our calculations, if you begin saving 6% of this at age 25 (about $760 a month), you will amass nearly $600,000 when you are ready to retire. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It isn’t too late for our potential Supreme Court justice to begin either. With a simple savings plan and some smart budgeting, Judge Kavanaugh will be able to contribute more towards his retirement account, while still managing to keep his kids at <a href=\"https://www.bsstoday.org/\">Blessed Sacrament School</a> and cheering on his beloved Washington Nationals (a passion those who know me know I share.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">  </span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Sherman Wealth | What We Can Learn From Brett Kavanaugh\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kE8rkQuOck?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Were you surprised to learn that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court justice nominee with an annual income of $247,000, could have racked up debt and saved so little for retirement?  A recent article in Vanity Fair reports that the Washington native accrued between $60,000 and $200,000 on three credit cards and a loan for Washington [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}],"featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/26a4d/IMG_7816-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/4e5cc/IMG_7816-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/5398f/IMG_7816-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/26a4d/IMG_7816-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/897d1/IMG_7816-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/57238/IMG_7816-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/f1431/IMG_7816-1.jpg 2048w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"0aaffd62-c5a0-5b07-abff-9597db070c01","slug":"financial-literacy-beers-with-brad","title":"Introducing Beers with Brad","content":"<p>We have hosted two very successful <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/beers-with-brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Beers with Brad</strong></a> financial literacy seminars in Gaithersburg, Maryland at Launch Workplaces.  We’ve had terrific beer from great local breweries around Maryland.

The idea, of course, is that financial planners and wealth managers assist you in creating a road map for your money that helps you grow savings for lifestyle goals like retirement, purchasing a home, or sending your kids to the college of their dreams. The term “wealth management” often begs the question: What does “being wealthy” mean? And when do you need a financial planner to help you manage your wealth?</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Do People View Wealth?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-05-15/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-be-wealthy-in-america?__twitter_impression=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has shown that the definition of being wealthy rises as people age. Bloomberg states that Boomers tend to view $2.4 million as a requirement to be “wealthy” whereas millennial&#8217;s view wealth as a $2 million requirement. That’s a fairly large discrepancy &#8211; and it’s pretty clear what’s causing it. The younger we are, the more likely we are to view our financial future with a sense of optimism. We also tend to be more short-sighted in our financial planning, and believe that a smaller amount of wealth will last longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we age, we become more realistic about our finances. We start to see the big picture, and that honest truth is that we often need a lot more money than we realize. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Does Wealth Mean to You?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the discrepancy in what quantifies “wealth” among generations, one thing stays the same: people view wealth as several consistent things. They believe that wealth is:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freedom</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to stop worrying</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A secure future</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caring for yourself and your loved ones</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people also say that being wealthy equates to taking time for themselves in their daily life. According to the same survey, the majority of millennial&#8217;s believe that they will be wealthy in the future. However, the same optimism doesn’t translate to Boomers and other generations. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Importance of Saving</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to building wealth is saving a lot, and saving early. The sooner you can start to prioritize saving in your budget, the sooner you can begin to take advantage of compound interest. I’ve discussed this in <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/compound-interest-can-help-build-wealth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous blog posts</a>, but to review:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compound interest is essentially a snowball effect. As a snowball rolls down a hill, it grows in size. Even if you start with a small amount of money invested, it picks up more and more snow with each revolution. By the time you reach the bottom of the hill, the snowball has grown significantly, and will continue to grow faster the more you have invested. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This demonstrates the importance of saving early on in your financial life. Although many millennial&#8217;s feel positively about their opportunity for wealth, they won’t be able to capitalize on these goals if they don’t prepare now. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Importance of a Financial Plan</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This wealth study by Bloomberg also indicated that most people, unsurprisingly, felt more secure in their finances when they worked with a financial advisor on constructing their financial plan.

The article states that “Short-term-oriented capital markets have discouraged companies with a longer term view from going public at all, depriving the economy of innovation and opportunity. Fewer public companies has also meant fewer opportunities for retail investors to create wealth through their 401ks and individual retirement accounts.”</p>\n<p>What does your endgame look like?  Can you envision kids’ college tuition paid for, a beach house, summers off or traveling the globe?  It is never too late to change your mindset and your daily habits to achieve your dreams.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","excerpt":"<p>Let’s face it &#8211; we live in a world where people expect their needs will be met with instant gratification.  Social media, online shopping and the availability of having access to everything right at our fingertips means that consumers have high expectations that their needs will be met immediately without having to wait for what [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}],"featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8858746492048644,"src":"/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/26a4d/caps-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/4e5cc/caps-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/5398f/caps-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/26a4d/caps-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/897d1/caps-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/57238/caps-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/7d505/caps-1.jpg 2016w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"5669e8bc-64c1-5491-a216-d7ed5f0291a4","slug":"patient-investors","title":"Patient Investors Come Out on Top","content":"<p>Many feel they don’t have the money they need to invest, so they forego savings altogether. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>If this is you, the time has come for you to stop shooting yourself in the foot, and start saving today. Consistency while saving is key, and can make all the difference over time. Each dollar that you contribute to your portfolio adds up. In the long run, your investments early on can make a real impact, and when the time comes to withdraw your hard earned savings, the interest you’ve earned on your investments will help to provide a comfortable retirement or any long term goal you might be saving towards.</p>\n<p><strong>Start Saving Now</strong></p>\n<p>Consider the difference of waiting to begin saving. At age 27 you will need to put away $214 a month to reach a goal of $1 million. When you start at age 37, you will need to put away $541 a month to reach your goal. If you wait until age 47, that number rises to $1,491 a month and if you wait until age 57, you’ll need to put away a hefty $5,168 a month. Waiting until the last minute (age 62) would mean having to stash $13,258 a month to reach $1 million by the age 67 &#8211; ouch!</p>\n<p>When you factor in things like compound interest, the negative impact of delaying your retirement savings becomes increasingly obvious. <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compound interest is often compared to a snowball.</a> If a 2-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny surface.</p>\n<p>As it keeps rolling, the snowball grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution. If you invest $1,000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2,158.93, in 20 years that will be $4,660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. It takes patience, but with time you can turn $1,000 into $21,724.52. That sounds like a lot of money, but if we’re being realistic, $1,000 is often spent on:</p>\n<p>• A weekend skiing with friends<br />\n• A few months of dining out with friends or your spouse<br />\n• A new piece of furniture, or tech that you may/may not need</p>\n<p>By hitting “pause” on these non-essential goals, you can easily start saving today and take advantage of compound interest.</p>\n<p>No matter where you are right now, the crucial point is to begin putting money aside immediately to achieve your long-term financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your future goals?</strong></p>\n<p>Travel? Education for your kids? Paying off your mortgage?</p>\n<p>Even when you contribute a minimal amount annually, if you’re consistent with that contribution over many years, the growth your investment will make can maximize your wealth in the long ron.</p>\n<p>The idea that you don’t have enough money right now to make your investment worthwhile is hurting you and your future. Resist the urge to overthink how much you are investing, and just act by giving what you can to your future savings today. Remember: every dollar counts, and the satisfaction of watching your investment grow over time will give you peace of mind and a freedom to plan for the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4322\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"921\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1.png 1200w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1-300x230.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1-1024x786.png 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1-768x589.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Don’t Jump Ship When Things Go South</strong></p>\n<p>Many investors view themselves as being rationally-minded individuals who don’t take sudden action when the markets become turbulent. Too often, though, people do try to time the markets, and wind up making a wrong decision as a result.</p>\n<p>Derek Horstmeyer of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/impatient-investors-get-caught-in-the-return-gap-1525658940\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall Street Journal</a> writes &#8220;Most investors think of themselves as rational and immune from the behavioral elements that periodically roil markets. Human factors, however, do continue to affect our personal portfolio decisions—usually to the detriment of our long-run returns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thinking too much about the “perfect timing” when growing our portfolios is a strategy that will more often than not cause people to lose money in the long run. A far better investment plan is to focus on the big picture, and less on a perfect portfolio &#8211; where every decision is made at the exact right time.</p>\n<p>Timing the market is less important than time in the market, and getting caught up in getting that “perfect timing” is almost certain to cost you money. Aiming toward a good, solid return on your investment is a smarter strategy than worrying about every detail affecting your portfolio. All too often, people panic as soon as things start to go south (pulling out when the market has already hit bottom and putting in more when at the top). As a result, they often don’t experience this stated return in full. By resisting this urge to make a rash decision, investors showing behavioral restraint may actually wind up saving 1-2 percentage points a year.</p>\n<p>Starting early is a critical component to a successful portfolio. It is never too late (or too early) to start, so the sooner the better. Beginning in 2011, studies were conducted where participants were shown a computer generated rendering of what they might look like at their age of retirement. They were then asked to make financial decisions about whether to spend their money today or save that money for the future.</p>\n<p>In each study, those individuals who were shown pictures of their future selves allocated more than twice as much money towards their retirement accounts than those who did not see the age-progressed images. Seeing the images gave the participants a connection with their future selves that they did not possess before. As a result, their saving behavior changed dramatically because, “saving is like a choice between spending money today or giving it to a stranger years from now.”</p>\n<p><strong>Picture Your Retirement</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of viewing your future self as a stranger, think of how you actually might look. Then think of the financial decisions you are making today and how they will affect you in the future.</p>\n<p>Are your spending and saving habits today matching up with how well that future self is able to live tomorrow? Every delay you make toward saving for retirement, or investing wisely means a further burden you will place on yourself later on. In fact, starting your retirement saving early is actually more important than earning higher returns at a later date.</p>\n<p>The importance of starting now can’t be stressed enough. Luckily, fee-only, fiduciary advisors exist to help everyday people in making wise choices and to lessen the anxiety associated with what can seem like an overwhelming task.</p>\n<p>The good news is you don’t even have to be a millionaire to get this customized service. Working with a professional will enable you to maximize your return on investment and tailor a savings plan just for you. Don’t delay getting started. The benefits of starting early and often far outweigh how much you actually save.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","excerpt":"<p>Many feel they don’t have the money they need to invest, so they forego savings altogether.

For some, this means pouring a large portion of their money into their business. However, investing all of your time and money into your business can create an unhealthy financial balance in your life because in this situation, the success of your business will fully decide the success and growth of your personal wealth.</p>\n<p>Separating your business finances from your personal finances is hard and sometimes it’s impossible to keep the two fully isolated.

Even if you have an airtight plan for profit, there’s a chance your business will experience some rough patches. To prevent this from negatively impacting your personal finances, start building your savings as soon as you can. If you haven’t started your business yet, you have some time to grow a cash savings that’s accessible to keep your personal finances in check in case of a emergency. Giving yourself several months worth of expenses is non-negotiable, and having a year or more is ideal.</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you’ve already launched your business, don’t panic. You can still prioritize saving in your current budget. To get started, set an attainable savings goal and design your budget to help reach it. Cut back on personal expenses to free up some cash flow to reach those goals.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Keep Business and Personal Expenses Low</h2>\n<p>If you’re just getting started, you’re probably already working to keep your business expenses as low as possible. This becomes harder to do as you start hitting your stride.

You’ve worked for the money, found success, and reinvested a large portion of that back into your business. However, if you keep increasing business expenses, you’ll have less wiggle room to protect your personal finances if things go south. (For more, see: <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/03/100803.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>401(k) Plans for the Small Business Owner</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>As you grow, your expenses will inevitably increase. Instead of trying to fight that, refocus to try and carefully evaluate every expense you take on. Shop around for less expensive options, or ask other business owners whether they have a similar expense, and how they’re handling it. You might find a creative solution that you hadn’t thought of before.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Avoid Distractions</h2>\n<p>We live in a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gig-economy.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gig economy</a> where “side hustles” are the latest and greatest financial pursuit. There’s nothing wrong with having a side hustle, but as an entrepreneur it doesn’t always make sense. Your business should be your number one priority. Rather than picking a lucrative side hustle that will take time away from your business, refocus that energy into finding other streams of revenue for your number one priority.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Find new ways to add value to the customers you already serve, get involved in a collaborative project with another professional that will direct business your way, and think outside of the box when growing your revenue, rather than finding a less-focused method of growing your income.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Get Smart About Investing</h2>\n<p>It’s tempting to have your business be your sole investment. Don’t fall into that trap. By having a diverse investment portfolio, you’re helping to ensure that your wealth is growing independent of your business. If you continually invest exclusively in your business, you’re increasing the amount of risk you take on.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a worst-case-scenario situation, your business goes under and you lose all of your money. To avoid that outcome, invest wisely, and in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversifiedfund.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diversified funds</a>.</p>\n<p>You may look at other professionals like doctors or lawyers who own their own practices and think, “Wow, they’re well educated, smart and successful.” We see them and assume they have it all together, and that their finances are in a better spot than ours. The truth is, they’re business owners just like you. Their businesses are equally at risk. There are no financial literacy courses at medical school.</p>\n<p>The good news is that you have the ability to take charge of your business and personal finances starting now. You can work to build savings, lower expenses and reduce the amount of risk you take on. If you make living a financially smart life a priority, you can make it happen.

While college enrollment and the number of college graduates has continued to increase, financial literacy lags among these young people at record lows. Where does this disconnect come from?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few states offer personal finance or economics courses and even fewer states test students on the financial knowledge they have acquired. It therefore comes as no surprise that American students (and we can infer American adults) have one of the lowest levels of financial literacy when compared to other countries.  While the number of student loans has increased,</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>44% of Americans don’t have enough cash to cover a $400 emergency</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>43% of student loan borrowers are not making payments</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>38% of U.S. households have credit card debt</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>33% of American adults have $0 saved for retirement</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why does it matter? How is it affecting the economy?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are graduating with loans they can’t afford to pay back and with minimal financial knowledge in planning for their futures. According to <a href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/\">Student Loan Hero</a>, Americans have over $1.48 trillion in student loan debt, which is more </span><a href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">than double</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the total U.S. credit card debt of $620 billion. This debt is becoming a major barrier to home ownership. 43% of student loan borrowers are not making payments and most of these individuals do not have any </span><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nearly-half-dont-have-the-cash-to-pay-for-a-400-emergency-fed-survey-finds-2017-05-19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">savings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A lack of sound financial knowledge will affect the economy as these millennials enter the labor force burdened with student loans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As parents, we play a vital role in educating our children about the importance of personal finances.  In the Sherman household, we are teaching our children the importance of finances on a daily basis. Our 4 year old son is learning about savings by doing chores in return for an allowance, which he saves in his piggy bank. He is learning to save and spend his money wisely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents can begin educating their children at home in order to increase the financial literacy of their kids. By demonstrating wise financial habits, parents can serve as role models for their kids. Talking in an age appropriate way to your children about the dangers of debt and the importance of saving a portion of any money they earn instills financial values and lessons your child can use throughout life.  You may find that using an allowance is a way that you can teach your kids about saving and spending appropriately. Since it has been shown that kids who manage their own money have been found to demonstrate better financial habits in the future, giving your kids the opportunity to spend and save their own allowance or money earned is a good way to prepare them for later on. Even a simple trip to the store can be used as an opportunity to start the conversation about the danger of credit cards and how they should only be used in an emergency.  Educating your kids at an early age will enable them to better learn and practice sound financial habits while under your watchful eye and cause them to be less likely to make irrational decisions once they are out on their own. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4265 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-300x225.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-768x576.png 768w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1.png 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This issue is not only affecting students and young adults.  Many professionals with advanced degrees have spent countless hours studying and researching information in their particular field.  Despite all of the hours spent earning their degrees, many of these people have never taken a single course in financial education and are surprisingly not prepared to deal with the important financial decisions affecting their futures.  As a result, many extremely smart and successful people are making critical financial errors which can negatively impact the amount of money they have saved upon retirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in 2011, studies were conducted where participants were shown a computer generated rendering of what they might look like at their age of retirement.  They were then asked to make financial decisions about whether to spend their money today or save that money for the future. In each study, those individuals who were shown pictures of their future selves allocated more than twice as much money towards their retirement accounts than those who did not see the age-progressed images.  Seeing the images gave the participants a connection with their future selves that they did not possess before. As a result, their spending/saving behavior changed dramatically because “saving is like a choice between spending money today or giving it to a stranger years from now.”</span></p>\n<p>The benefits of educating your children about the importance of personal finances are undeniable, and you&#8217;ll be able to set them up for a promising future and help them prepare for retirement. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com\">Visit us online</a> for more information about how we can help improve your financial life.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","excerpt":"<p>Would it surprise you to know that students graduating from high school enter college with little to no knowledge about their finances, how to budget, or save for their futures?

You’re losing money, both in lost interest and because inflation can reduce the value of your savings.</p>\n<p>Do you know if  your own savings account’s interest is keeping pace with rising interest rates?

Lately it’s hit home for me, though, because two of my high school friends were diagnosed with cancer over the last year. Both are in remission now, thankfully, but it brings home the fact that it never hurts to be prepared.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is: if you&#8217;re old enough to be filing your taxes this month, you&#8217;re old enough to take basic steps to create basic estate documents. And yes, things will evolve and there will be adjustments to make over your &#8211; hopefully &#8211; long and prosperous life. But it&#8217;s never too early to get started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The single most important thing we all need is a <b>will</b> and/or <b>account beneficiaries</b>, so that it&#8217;s clear where you want your assets to go. Statistics show that not only do most young people not have a will, but that most young parents who do have wills haven’t updated them when they had a second or third child. At the very least make sure you&#8217;ve named beneficiaries for all your bank and investment accounts (also known as TOD or  &#8220;transfer on death&#8221; provisions), to prevent having the courts probate and decide how to transfer your assets. If you need help we can connect you with our excellent network of Washington area professionals who can advise you about making the best choices for you and your loved ones.</li>\n<li>If you have kids, naming <strong>guardians</strong> for them is critical, to protect them should the unthinkable happen.</li>\n<li>And don&#8217;t forget yourself! My mother just had knee replacement surgery about two weeks ago and, just before she did, she handed me her <strong>advanced medical directive</strong>. I was grateful she did (she&#8217;s fine!) and your loved ones will be grateful to know what your preferences are if they ever need to make decisions for you. In addition to a life insurance policy, don&#8217;t forget <strong>disability insurance</strong> in case for some reason you can&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ve never had to use the policy I took out in my 20s but I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s there.</li>\n<li>And finally, why not create a <strong>notebook or file </strong>where all your important documents are handy? It&#8217;s a great habit to get into when you’re young. Or you could gather your documents in a tool like the <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/client-portal/\">online document vault</a> our clients have access to. So take a moment and get organized &#8211; most likely you wont need it for a long time but you&#8217;ll have created a great habit for yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>April is a great time for an overall financial check-up: you have all your tax documents organized, which means it will be that much easier to get these important personal documents organized as well. April is also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Literacy_Month\">Financial Literacy Month</a> so, as always, call us if you have questions or for a free consultation and financial check-up.</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","excerpt":"<p>There was an excellent article in the WSJ last week about a topic most of us don’t really want to think about (but really need to:) how to prepare in case you die young.

Let that sink in for a moment&#8230;</p>\n<p>In a nutshell: it&#8217;s still considered acceptable in the financial industry for advisors to give clients advice that is <em>less than the best for the clients</em> when it yields a higher commission for the broker.</p>\n<p>In case you were wondering, the plaintiffs challenging the DOL&#8217;s Fiduciary Rule were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Financial Services Institute, Financial Services Roundtable, and Insured Retirement Institute. None of whom, clearly, are friends to the individual investor.</p>\n<p>Because different Courts&#8217; decisions have not been consistent about this Obama Administration effort to protect individual advisors, there is speculation the question will climb at some point to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiduciary-rule-fight-drags-on-for-financial-firms-1521230901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supreme Court</a>, so this isn&#8217;t over. And while the Fiduciary Rule was not perfect, this is clearly worse.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, what can you as an individual investor do to make sure your interests are not being sacrificed for the benefit of your advisor? Very simple: make sure your advisor is ALREADY a Fiduciary. And if they&#8217;re not, switch.

The solution is to make sure your goals are SMART goals: goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and linked to a Timetable.</p>\n<p>It is important to set<strong> S</strong>pecific and <strong>R</strong>elevant immediate, short, and long-term savings goals that you can visualize &#8211; like a beach vacation, a bigger home, or a child’s graduation ceremony. Tying savings goals to images that align with your life and your values can make them more emotionally compelling and easier to keep in mind.</p>\n<p>Equally critical is to make your goals <strong>M</strong>easurable and set a <strong>T</strong>imetable: how much you are planning to save each month, or by a certain date. Don’t set figures or dates that are impossible; make sure they are <strong>A</strong>ttainable as well.</p>\n<p>Just like physical fitness, financial fitness is best achieved by setting specific, achievable, and measurable goals. A defined goal, whether it’s “save 5% of each paycheck” or “add extra hours to save for a vacation,” gives you a much better shot at success rather than a simple “I should be saving more.”</p>\n<p>A huge part of good financial planning is goal setting. A good financial planner can help you calculate the long-term benefits of saving more and on a regular sustainable basis. It’s particularly important that your financial planner is a <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\">fee-only Fiduciary</a>: that means there will be no “additional charges” or investment recommendations with commissions for the broker that could throw off your savings calculations.</p>\n<p>And if you’d like help defining financial goals and evaluating whether you are saving enough to achieve them, please feel free to<a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"> contact me</a> for a free introductory call.

Gone are the days of the easy mortgages, the no-income-verification loans, and The Big Short. In fact, qualifying for a mortgage may rank as one of the biggest challenges you face as someone who is self-employed.</p>\n<p>And if that weren’t stressful enough, with recent signals from the Fed that mortgage rates may be rising in 2018, you probably want to act quickly to pre-qualify if you’re considering a move.</p>\n<p>As a self-employed business owner who just bought a new home for our growing family, I can testify that the mortgage process is not for the faint-hearted. Every time I completed a lender’s checklist they come back to me for more information. This was not my first mortgage but the time and energy it took this time around was beyond what I expected &#8211; and I’m a credit-worthy borrower and financial pro with a background in the mortgage world.</p>\n<p>So what’s the best way to prepare? To understand the issues, think like a bank. In deciding to lend you hundreds of thousands of dollars, the bank wants to know, first and foremost, that you will be able to pay them back &#8211; steadily, regularly, over time.</p>\n<p>Here are 3 of the biggest hurdles you may have to overcome:</p>\n<p><strong>SHOW YOU MEET THE INCOME REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing a potential lender asks to see is your W-2 form, the document that shows salaried workers’ annual wages and withheld taxes. Business owners and independent contractors are unlikely to have W2s, and instead need to present their full tax returns, including profit &amp; loss and deductions &amp; depreciation, as well as their own income.</p>\n<p>Not only are lenders not likely to be expert at understanding your business and your cash flow, but the salary you show on paper may be deceptively low. That’s because most business owners invest a sizable chunk “back into the business” when they’re getting started as well as taking deductions for travel, leased vehicles, and purchases of computers, office supplies, and even their phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> If you’re thinking about buying a house, consult a financial planner, your accountant, or a trusted mortgage professional (we’ve suggested a few below) about how much to accurately deduct – or not &#8211; this year to show sufficient income and an acceptable debt-to-income ratio.</p>\n<p><strong>HAVE ALL THE PAPERWORK</strong></p>\n<p>Having paperwork that tells the full story can make all the difference, so now is the perfect time to prepare a file with the documents you’ve already collected for the IRS. Remember, though, that this year’s tax returns and records may not be enough to show your business has been steadily growing. Be prepared with records from previous years, and bonus points for data about how your sector has been doing as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready</strong>: Keeping good records is key so if you haven’t already started, get started now, and see what you can put together for previous years.</p>\n<p><strong>MAKE SENSE OF COMPLEXITY </strong></p>\n<p>Every company and every consultant is unique and it may be hard to reconcile your business’ specific challenges and trajectory with the solid predictability a mortgage lender is looking for. You may want to bring a trusted accountant or financial or business advisor to the meeting with the lender – someone who knows your business well and can explain its structure, operations, and cash flow in context. If your advisor can’t be there, ask them to write a brief document explaining your data. Consider also requesting profit-and-loss statements prepared without personal expenses to show the difference between reported income and actual income.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> be prepared to explain what your numbers mean in context and turn to a trusted advisor, if possible, who can translate your numbers for the lender and help them understand you’re a good candidate.</p>\n<p><strong>AVOID CREDIT SCORE SURPRISES</strong></p>\n<p>You wouldn’t be the first, or last, person to find discrepancies in your <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\">credit score</a>. Correct any discrepancies and make sure it’s correctly updated <em>before</em> applying for a mortgage. And – obviously – pay off any outstanding debt.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> get credit reports from the major agencies and make sure that they are accurate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you’re in the market for a new home, let us help you and guide you through the process.

The good news is that benefit has now been expanded: you’ll be able to withdraw up to $10,000 per year per student for <strong>elementary, middle, and high school tuition</strong> if your child attends or will attend a private or religious school. And, if you’ve already been saving for K-12 with a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/saving-for-college-529-plans/\">Coverdell ESA</a>, you can also rollover that account to a 529 plan without tax consequences.</p>\n<h4><strong>Saving by Off-Setting State Taxes </strong></h4>\n<p>The new 2018 tax law limits deductions for your state income and property taxes to $10,000, so you might find yourself paying more state tax this year. But if you live in one of the 34 states that offers a <strong>state tax deduction for contributions to a 529 plan</strong>, you can lower your state taxes by contributing more to your 529. In most states you have to be enrolled in one of that state’s own plans to take the deduction, but several allow you to deduct contributions from <em>any</em> state plan. And, if you live in one of the several states whose 529 plans include state tax credits, you could also find yourself paying considerably less.</p>\n<h4><strong>Turbo Charging the Benefits for Younger Children</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>529 plans allow “front-loading</strong>,” a term for making up to five years of contributions at once. This not only allows you to “catch up” for a child already in elementary or secondary school, it also allows you to maximize state tax deductions or credits. And anyone can make contributions to your child’s 529 plan. Friends and relatives can each contribute up to $15,000 per recipient, they can also “front-load” up to five years of contributions as well, maximizing their own tax savings. Additionally, if they make direct payments to services provided for beneficiaries’ tuition or medical expenses, these expenses would be tax-free, even though the costs surpass the annual gift tax exclusion.</p>\n<h4><strong>New Benefits for Special Needs Students</strong></h4>\n<p>The new tax law allows <strong>assets in 529 accounts to be transferred to ABLE accounts</strong> without any penalties as long as they are transferred by 2025. ABLE plans &#8211; named for the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act &#8211; are designed to provide tax-favored savings for people with disabilities without limiting their access to benefits such as Medicaid, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The annual contribution cap for ABLE plans is $15,000 and an account can reach $100,000 without affecting SSI benefits. You can also make tax-free withdrawals when paying for expenses such as housing, legal fees and employment trainings.</p>\n<h4><strong>Plans Can Be Transferred to Another Child</strong></h4>\n<p>If you no longer need the account for the child it was created for, <strong>you can change the plan’s beneficiary to another family member</strong>, saving you the income tax on 529 earnings and 10% federal penalty you pay if you withdraw money for non-educational purposes.</p>\n<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>\n<p>Every parent – and grandparent &#8211; should consider opening one or more 529 accounts for their children’s education. There is no limit to the number of plans you can contribute to, or the number of accounts that can be opened for any child, so study up to determine which plans make the most sense for you. But remember: each state’s rules are different so – like your kids – you’ll want to do your homework.</p>\n<p>Then, as with all smart savings plans, contribute on a regular basis over time, through market ups and downs, to benefit from dollar cost averaging and watch your interest compound – and your child’s educational opportunities grow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>For how the new tax law affects the &#8220;Kiddie Tax&#8221; for Uniform Gifts and Transfers to Minors (UGMAs and UTMAs) <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/kiddie-tax-education/\">please click here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>At Sherman Wealth Management we’re passionate about children’s education so please give us a call if you have any questions about your state’s 529 options.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article initially appeared on <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/changes-529-plans-offer-tax-advantages/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\"/>\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","excerpt":"<p>Are you saving for your child’s education with a 529 account?

In 2008, this threshold increased to cover children through age 18 and full time students through age 23.”</p>\n<h3><strong>How were Uniform Gifts and Transfers Taxed?</strong></h3>\n<p>UGMAs and UTMAs have been a popular way to save money in a child&#8217;s or grandchild’s name precisely because of their significant tax advantages. A portion of the money earned &#8211; the first $1,050 of the child’s investment income (including interest, dividends and capital gains distributions) has been tax-free; the next $1,050 has taxed at the child’s rate; and investment income above $2,100 was taxed at the parent’s or grandparent’s “marginal” tax rate, ie the highest rate applied to the last dollar earned.</p>\n<h3><strong>How is it Changing?</strong></h3>\n<p>The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made an important change to this graduated “Kiddie Tax.”</p>\n<p>Instead of a child’s investment income above $2,100 being taxed at the parent or grandparent’s individual tax rate, it will be taxed at the 2018 trust and estate tax rates:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 269px;\" width=\"831\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Investment Income</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Trust &amp; Estate Tax Rate</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Up to $2,550</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$2,551-$9,150</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$9,151-$12,500</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Over $12,500</td>\n<td>37%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>Will You Pay More or Less?</strong></h3>\n<p>How much you will pay depends on the amount of investment income and your own marginal tax bracket. As a rule of thumb, the more you have the more you may be taxed this year.</p>\n<p>While the Tax Code changed with this law, it unfortunately did not get simpler.

It’s hard not to panic if your oldest child is in college and her 529 just took a hit or if you’re a year away from retirement and your IRA just lost 15% of it’s paper value.</p>\n<p>Although you no doubt know that impulsive trading is one of the least efficient ways to reach your true long-term investment potential, emotions are powerful drivers. In fact, in Robert Shiller&#8217;s book “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsz9d9vjLzY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m16s\">Irrational Exuberance,&#8221;</a> he states that the emotional state of investors “is no doubt one of the most important factors causing the bull market” we just recently experienced.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows that investor sentiment dropped 30% in the beginning of the year, suggesting that investors’ overall attitude may have been veering from bullish to bearish, although it did bounce back this week.  What it also suggests is that Recency Bias caused investors’ to react more strongly to typical market volatility because it was a-typical during the long period of calm we just experienced.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-4143 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-300x134.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-300x134.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-768x343.png 768w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1.png 1002w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The key in times of volatility is to keep your eye on your long-term goals rather than reacting impulsively to temporary trends. In <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/learn-loss.asp#ixzz56deq33Dq\">Taking The Sting Out Of Investment Loss</a><u>,</u> Brian Boch advises: “The golden rule is to differentiate between [decisions] based on rational and prudent trading strategies on the one hand and emotionally-based, panicky decisions on the other. The former generally leads to success over time, while the latter tends to lead to failure.”</p>\n<p>Here at Sherman Wealth Management we believe there is productivity and security in planning for the unknown by defining what it is you already <u>do</u> know. Knowing yourself, your emotions, and the risk you are willing to take is the first step. The second is creating a long-term financial plan with a conflict-free, Fiduciary advisor.</p>\n<p>In a recent post, <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2018/02/the-drawbacks-of-behavioral-finance-during-a-market-correction/\"><u>Ben Carlson</u></a> wrote:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The prep time for a market correction or crash comes well before it actually happens by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting realistic expectations.</li>\n<li>Mapping out a course of attack for when losses occur.</li>\n<li>Making decisions ahead of time about what moves (if any) to make and when depending on what happens.</li>\n<li>Deciding on the correct level of risk to be taken.</li>\n<li>Building behaviorally-aware portfolios.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best solution to financial <em>and</em> emotional volatility is to work with a financial planner on a plan that will make you feel comfortable through the market’s natural ups <u>and</u> downs. You may not be able to control outside factors but you can control your reactions by recognizing how bias works and by preparing both emotionally <em>and</em> financially to reach the long-term goals that matter to you.</p>\n<p>And, as always, if you&#8217;d like to review your plan and how your allocations conform to your own risk tolerance and response to volatility, please <a href=\"https://meetme.so/BradSherman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://meetme.so/BradSherman\">let me know</a> and we’ll schedule a call.</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","excerpt":"<p>Whether you realize it or not, chances are good that you are prone to something called Recency Bias, which is the common tendency to think that what has been happening recently will continue to happen in the near future.

The market calls it a “correction” but, to the individual investor seeing their net worth drop, it never feels “correct,” particularly since it’s impossible to accurately predict when the volatility and the draw down in prices will end.</p>\n<p>It’s hard for anyone to really anticipate what their own risk tolerance will be until it’s put to the test. In moments of calm, we all want to think we’ll have the presence of mind to remember that the market is cyclical and that downturns and corrections are often an opportunity.

This current market volatility comes after the longest period in history without a correction and with remarkably <em>low</em> volatility. As a result, Friday’s sell off and Monday’s drop may have been a bit of a shock, even though a 5% drop was not unusual as recently as 2016. That makes it particularly difficult to anticipate what will happen next, in the direct short term, since investors may react unpredictably, including too many people who are driven by how they guess <em>others</em> will react.</p>\n<p>There are two important things to remember when the market is volatile. The first is that volatility and risk are not the same thing: volatility is a normal variation in value, risk is the possibility that an investment will fail. The second is that it&#8217;s important to look at trends over time, not just yesterday&#8217;s news.

It may sound like a foreign concept to some, but for many simply having their own emotions attached to their personal finances, make it too close for comfort. They say anytime emotions are involved logic can go out the window. Let us help remind you of the logic of needs vs. wants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is a need? Human basic needs are as simple as food, water, and shelter, therefore, your monthly mortgage or rent payment, monthly food and beverage expenses, and we can also add transportation i.e. car payment, insurance, and gas all go into this category. What may seem shocking to some is that everything else is a want. In the complicated consumer driven world we live in it may be hard to fathom, but if it isn’t necessary for your survival it is a desire, not a necessity. And furthermore, if it’s a materialistic good rather than an intangible experience, experts say you probably won’t even miss it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ok now that we’ve defined a want and a need, lets practice an exercise. According to David Bach, author of “The Automatic Millionaire” “Becoming rich requires nothing more than committing and sticking to a systematic savings and investment plan” <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/self-made-millionaire-got-life-changing-money-advice-at-age-7.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/self-made-millionaire-got-life-changing-money-advice-at-age-7.html</a> Ready to get started now? Take out a piece of paper and pen. Create two categories; wants and needs. Start listing everything you spend money on in a month. Determine whether it is a want or need. Create another list. Write your future goals. Picture yourself taking the vacation you’ve dreamed of for years, or retiring early. Whatever your goals are, visualize yourself completing them. Now return to your list of wants and needs. How can you “trim the fat” on your daily spending habits so you really can save more for the things that will fulfill you later. For example : One easy fat trimmer is to shop around for things you already are paying for. Items such as your cell phone, cable, internet, and insurance can easily be shopped around for a lower price. Visualizing yourself completing your long term goals can help motivate you to sacrifice temporary gratification for something that may lead to a happier you in the long run. Now you can put more towards your retirement, so you can vacation permanently, sooner!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, what tools will you need to implement to further achieve your goals? Personally, my wife and I are big fans of technology that track our spending, keep us honest and transparent by categorizing each purchase through linking our credit card spending and automatically deducting the budget category the purchase must be subtracted from. Theres nothing to hide when you make a budget, add all of your credit cards, and promise to stick to it. We’ve also found that being realistic and making achievable goals ensures we are more successful, but you know what makes us the most successful? Having a financial plan! Sherman Wealth Management uses tools that will link users accounts so we have access to your budget and balances and can help you come up with a financial plan right for you. Also by hiring a fee only fiduciary financial advisor whose emotions aren’t involved in our spending habits we’ve no longer clouded our logic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Still have your reservations? A study at Princeton found that every 10% rise in annual income moves people up the life satisfaction ladder the same amount, whether they’re making $25,000. Or $100,000. “High incomes don’t bring you happiness, but they do bring you a life you think is better.” That being said; What if we all gave ourselves a 10% rise in income by trimming the fat in our expenses and adding the profit to our bottom line further assisting us in accomplishing our goals.  What if we found that we possess the power and control to increase our actual happiness by simply living with less, saving more, and reaching our goals by following through with them? And what if by living with less we are more fulfilled.  Studies have proven that having less and living more simply does lead to greater overall life satisfaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feeling like you could use some help?

Sadly, it’s not just one person’s perspective. It’s a sentiment that is shared by the 40-50% of Americans who believe that winning the lottery is the only way they can get what they need for retirement.</p>\n<p>The odds of winning a Powerball have recently been calculated to be 1 in 292,000,000. As a financial advisor, I am frustrated by an investment strategy that is based on a verifiably unrealistic longshot. That frustration is only compounded by the fact that there is a simple solution! The real winning ticket to ensure you can live comfortably in retirement is not a lottery ticket, but rather a concept you likely have heard of but brushed aside: compound interest.</p>\n<p>It’s Been Said That Albert Einstein Called Compound Interest the Eighth Wonder of the World</p>\n<p>And even if he didn’t, it’s still a brilliant investing tool. Simply put, compounding is a process which generates additional return on an asset’s reinvested earnings. To be effective, it requires two simple things: the reinvestment of earnings, and time. If properly managed, compound interest can help your initial investment grow exponentially. For those of you who enjoy math, here’s the formula:</p>\n<p>Ending $$ = Beginning $$ * (1 + return) ^ total time frame of compounding</p>\n<p>While this is a useful strategy for all investors, for young investors in particular, it is the greatest investing tool for long-term growth, and the #1 argument in support of starting as early as possible. Just look at the graph below, which represents the growth of $100 over 30 years:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can see that without reinvestment, the return potential is significantly reduced no matter what the rate of return is. This is important to understand because many investors are tempted to capitalize on their gains too early. The results reflected in this graph make it clear that choosing to instead reinvest those gains is going to make a significant difference in the long run.</p>\n<p>The best advice for how to implement this strategy and maximize your long-run returns is to (1) postpone gains, and (2) rebalance efficiently. When tempted to take a short-term gain, always ask yourself: do you really need to sell? If not, don’t. Committing to a long-range investment strategy will make a world of difference in your returns. And when rebalancing, instead of creating a tax event by taking gains, consider allocating future proceeds into holdings that have underperformed.</p>\n<p>Compounding interest becomes more complicated when the effect of taxes is factored in. Investors are often not able to reinvest all of the money that has been paid out because the government takes its cut. In order to get around this, you should try to minimize the effects of taxes by putting money into tax efficient accounts; ensuring that tax inefficient assets/strategies are in kept in retirement accounts; allocating assets to tax efficient areas of the market such as municipal bonds and real estate; and utilizing ETFs to delay tax events for stock holdings.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be Einstein to understand the power of compounding interest. Instead of putting your fate in the hands of the lottery, take control of your retirement plan through smart, well-thought-out investment decisions.

band members are all pursuing their own solo careers.  In his 2017 solo debut album, the former One Direction member Harry Styles sings the hook “Just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times.”  While there are numerous interpretations of what the line is about, when I hear it my mind wanders immediately to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe that makes me a finance nerd, but I connect these two because the world of investing is changing so rapidly, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  It used to be that mutual funds were the be-all and end-all of getting exposure to diversified equity and fixed income returns.  Modern trends, though, show that millennial investors are increasingly enamored by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and are pouring more money in these diversified low-cost, passively managed index funds than ever before.  A recent </span><a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-millennials-love-etfs-2016-09-21?mg=prod/accounts-mw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that 66% of millennials say they expect to boost their holdings of ETFs over the next year, up from 61% in last year’s survey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see a similar growth trend in the chart below.  We can see that while asset levels for actively managed mutual funds are still eight times higher than ETF asset levels, there is a staggering difference in their annualized growth rates.  While mutual funds are barely growing at .8%, ETF assets are growing at a pace of 21.4%.  </span></p>\n<p><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conclusion is clear: ETFs took in more than three times the net inflows in the first half of 2017 because </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the world is changing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Millennials are seeking out the funds as an alternative to traditional mutual funds in response to the changing environment around them, the preference for low-fees, and the flexibility of being able to trade in and out of the funds as frequently and as quickly as they desire.  The faster that advisors start to recognize and adapt to that changing world, the better they are able to meet the needs and desires of their clients.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we understand that our clients are seeking low-cost, diversified portfolios and as a fiduciary, we feel it is our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities posed by ETFs.  We were one of the early adopters of these diversified funds because we saw the value of having a low-cost, tax-efficient portfolio that, if done wisely, can be combined to meet target allocations that have diversification benefits creating worthwhile risk-adjusted returns.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see ETFs as an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">opportunity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of competition.  Instead of individual stock picking, ETFs give us the ability to spend our time focusing on a top-down approach to asset allocation.  This means assessing where the opportunities lie within different asset classes and combining attractive ETFs in these</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> high-probability sandboxes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a way that we feel will maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Instead of the cookie-cutter allocation achieved by working with robo-advisors, we have real people putting together your portfolio and looking under the hood of these funds to ensure that they are the best pick for you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we want to be ahead of the times &#8211;

Kevin Brady) might not have learned as much as they could have from the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which arguably was defeated due to a lack of clear details and shortage of bipartisan support.  In a repeat tactic, the push for passing the bill under “budget reconciliation” would require only a simple majority in the Senate to pass the law.  But it should be noted that this can only happen if projections show that the total revenue differential over the next 10 years is $1.5 trillion or less.  Right now, </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2017/09/27/release-of-gops-long-awaited-tax-plan-reveals-exactly-why-tax-reform-is-so-hard/#35ce89314597\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projections</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> place it at $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.  That means the GOP will either need bipartisan Senate support with 60 votes or find $1 million in reduced projections.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the highlights of the proposed plan and how they could impact your personal income taxes if they should be passed:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fewer Tax Brackets</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Instead of the seven tax brackets we face today ranging from 10% to 39.6%, the new plan proposes only three: 12%, 25%, and 35%.  Because the plan does not specify where these cut-offs will be, though, we can only speculate on how these will impact individuals positively or negatively.  If speculation is correct, those currently facing 28% and 33% tax rates would see a tax cut to the new 25% rate, which would be beneficial.  The idea of adding a fourth bracket for the wealthiest Americans has also been floated.\n<p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Doubles the Standard Deduction, but Eliminates Personal Exemptions <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; The marketing tactic for the bill is that it is a huge break to middle-class Americans by doubling the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for single filers and from $12,000 to $24,000 for joint filers.\n<p></span></b><b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a catch, though</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  These increases are being offset by the elimination of personal exemptions. The result is what seems like a 50% increase to most taxpayers, in reality, is closer to 15%.</p>\n<p></span></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Reduction of Elimination of Itemized Deductions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; If in the past you have chosen to itemize your deductions, you could be getting the short end of the stick here.  The plan calls for reductions or elimination of many itemized deductions, without providing specifics on which ones.  It has only been stated that they will keep the deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions.  It also mentions benefits that encourage work, higher education and retirement savings, but provides no details on these.\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The largest red flag for many is concerning the elimination of state and local tax deductions.  Currently, you can deduct what you pay in state and local taxes from your federal income bill.  If this is eliminated, it could disproportionately affect those who live in high-tax states such as Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California, and Maryland.  Only two days after the plan was released, objections from Blue-state Republicans have caused them to reconsider eliminating these deductions.<br />\n</span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\nAdditionally, homeowners or anyone paying real estate taxes will see that their property taxes are no longer deductible under the new plan.  Again, this will have a disproportionately large impact for those living in states with high real estate taxes.<br />\n</span></b>Below is a breakdown of what the new and old tax brackets could look like for single filers:<i><span><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4073 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"814\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1.png 1251w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-300x125.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-1024x427.png 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-768x320.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px\" /></a></span></i><i><span>Source</span></i><span>: </span><span><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tax-plan-details-corporate-rate-individual-brackets-deductions-cuts-2017-9?nr_email_referer=1&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=PoliticsSelect&amp;pt=385758&amp;ct=Sailthru_BI_Newsletters&amp;mt=8&amp;utm_campaign=BI%20Politics%202017-09-28&amp;utm_term=Politics%20Select%20-%20Engaged%2C%20Active%2C%20Passive%2C%20Disengaged\">Business Insider</a></p>\n<p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Changes for Families</b><span>&#8211; There may be some significant changes to the tax code surrounding families as well, including single parents and households with two or more children.\n<p></span>Currently, single parents fall into a favorable tax bracket somewhere in between single and married-filing-joint rates as well as a 50% boost to their standard deduction.  The new plan would likely eliminate this, meaning single parents could face higher rates.</p>\n<p>That being said, these cuts could potentially be offset by an unspecified “significant increase” to the Child Tax Credit.  Depending on the size of this Child Tax Credit, households with a two or more children could also see increased rates because of the elimination of the exemption based on the number of children.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Eliminates the Death Tax and Alternative Minimum Tax</b><span> &#8211; The estate (“death”) tax only currently applies to 0.14% of Americans, whose assets exceeded $10.9 million and did not hire a competent estate planner.  So this likely does not affect you, but it would be eliminated under this plan.\n<p></span>The alternative minimum tax forces those who have an outsized number of deductions to pay an alternative tax rate instead.  The truth is, very few people understand it anyway.  This is likely a good thing, especially if the goal is simplicity.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Small Businesses, including ours!<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; In terms of small-business owners, there is a whole separate set of changes to be considered.  For ‘pass-through’ businesses like ours, the plan wants to lower the maximum rate from 39.6% to 25%, which is particularly appealing to making smaller firms more competitive.\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Questions still surround this due, though, to Steve Mnuchin’s </span><a href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/09/12/mnuchin-some-services-companies-wont-get-pass-through-tax-rate-update.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vague statements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding limitations on what types of businesses will get this lowered rate as well as how they will distinguish between personal income and business income.  Additionally, many have pointed out that nine in 10 businesses that pass through their income already pay at the 25% rate or less, meaning this change could be ultimately inconsequential.</p>\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For larger corporations, the plan proposes lowering the tax rate from 35% to 20% and a one-time repatriation of overseas assets at an unspecified lower rate.   </span></b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions related to your specific situation, don’t hesitate to contact us </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  We will keep you updated as more developments are made and the plan evolves.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.  They are for information purposes only.

 Are you using unreasonable future growth assumptions to accomplish your goals?  If you are honest with yourself and realize you are taking on more risk than you are comfortable with, you should adjust your risk level and financial plan as soon as possible, not as a reactionary measure to a market downturn.  Additionally, regardless of your risk tolerance, everyone should have an emergency fund that is invested conservatively as a fallback.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel that you are taking a level of risk that you are comfortable with, but are still worried about your own panic getting in the way of your plans &#8211; draft a plan now for how you will deal with it.  If you can’t handle seeing the color red, logging into your portfolio every day is probably not recommended. Ask yourself where there is wiggle room in your financial plan.  Prioritizing your goals and figuring out what you would do differently if the need arose is a good way to feel more secure if things are not going well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think making changes to your portfolio is the right move, make sure get a second opinion from someone with a level-head.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we are committed to answering all of your questions, addressing your concerns and helping you to avoid common behavioral mistakes.  When you imagine yourself in a sinking car, rest assured that we are right there to coach you through it.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**</span></i></p>\n<h6><b><i>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

associate </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan McKenna </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote a great piece about his experience being new to the biz that I thought was worth sharing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">___________________________________________________</span></p>\n<h1><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m new here.  </span></i></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best word I can think of for explaining the experience of being a freshly-graduated analyst entering this market is… </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baffling</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Every week I read the news that markets are hitting new all time highs, that we have shaken off the effects of the global financial crisis and that excellent Q2 earnings reports are the catalyst that will push stocks higher.  There is almost a weekly reminder that markets do not die from old age.  Yesterday, the Dow climbed back above 22000 as investor fears retreated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, every week I also read articles from investors screaming that the end is near, markets cannot possibly keep up with their current pace, P/E ratios are outlandish and we need to be paring back risk.  For example, a month ago, the co-founder and chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital LP, Jeffrey Gundlach, </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/gundlach-wary-of-pricey-market-sets-cap-on-doubleline-s-growth\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that risky assets are overvalued and that investors should be “moving toward the exits.”  Since then, markets have pushed even higher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No wonder the average client is looking to their advisor with a look of complete confusion and truthfully, a fair amount of fear.  In times like these, the words of my graduate-school mentor (one of the most brilliant finance professionals I know) often ring in my ears.  He always reminded me of a piece of wisdom I want to share with you: </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody knows anything in this field.</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By that he means… nobody </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">knows</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for certain what is going to happen.  If we truly did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">know</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the future, we’d never have to work again.  We could all leverage up, pick the winners, and make so much money our eyes would glaze over.  But we </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> know the future.  That’s why we spend so much time crafting diversified portfolios and picking the right amount of risk for each individual’s unique tolerance.  Face it: you’re probably not going to achieve your daydream of being the protagonist of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Short </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who calls the financial crisis before it happens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have to understand that the difference of opinion is what makes a market exist.  Don’t forget that there is an incremental seller for each and every buyer in the market.  Right when you’re convinced to buy a security, someone else is convinced to sell.  That is just how it works.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplest thing to do is to remain calm and stick to your plan.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we use broad-based financial planning that is designed around your unique risk tolerance and your goals.  Unless it directly affects your financial plan, ignore the noise in the markets and that nagging voice in the back of your mind that screams sell every time you read a negative piece of news.  </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I might be new here, but I can predict the future just as well as the next guy.

Equifax Inc., one of the largest three credit reporting companies, potentially compromising the personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers.  The systems they gained access to contained customers’ names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and addresses.  These four pieces of information are generally needed for consumers to apply for many forms of consumer credit, including credit cards and personal loans.  This raises the risk of fraud, as it means the hackers could have an easier time getting approved for credit under someone else’s name.  In addition to this information, credit card numbers, driver&#8217;s licenses, and dispute documents with sensitive information could have been compromised for some users.  Because Equifax gets its data from credit card companies, banks, retailers and lenders,</span><b> you could be affected regardless of whether or not you have ever knowingly provided them information</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is being called one of the largest and most threatening data breaches of recent years.  We encourage everyone to make sure they are protected and to closely monitor their credit for identity theft.  Equifax has set up a </span><a href=\"http://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help consumers determine if their information has been compromised.  One also can call their dedicated call center for consumers at 1-866-447-7559.  The company offers credit-monitoring and identity-theft protection products to guard consumers’ personal information.  Consumers can also protect themselves by immediately placing </span><a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fraud alerts on their credit reports</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  This means that a lender must contact you to verify your identity before it issues credit in your name for the next 90 days.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions, don’t

plans.</p>\n<h2>The mantra of the middle class is <em>buy a home</em>.  But is it always the best decision for your money?</h2>\n<p>Buying residential real estate certainly poses some undeniable advantages.  For many people, there is a certain pride in homeownership.  After all, it is the epitome of the American Dream.  Additionally, the interest and property tax portion of your mortgage is tax-deductible, and not unimportantly, homes tend to increase in value, build equity and provide a nest egg for the future.</p>\n<p>But what is very often overlooked by the average American is the opportunity cost of their money and how their mortgages play a role in that.  A recent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/is-money-in-the-bank-always-the-smarter-bet-1503662401\">Wall Street Journal article</a> highlights the important decision individuals face when they have excess cash.  It recommends taking a close look at what interest rates you pay on a mortgage and how those compare to the savings amount on your bank account as well as the rate of return on investments in equity and bonds.</p>\n<p>When homeowners do this, they often are struck with a revelation: they are likely not getting as high of a return on their investment as they would have if they were invested more heavily in equity.  Ultimately, the opportunity cost of having your money tied up in your mortgage could actually hurt your long-term wealth.  Even worse, the tax breaks you are receiving do not cover the amount of loss incurred from your interest rate!  A recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-28/how-the-top-1-keeps-getting-richer\">Bloomberg article</a> went so far to say that this simple understanding is one of the distinctions that separates the world’s wealthiest individuals from the middle class and one of the major contributing factors to income inequality.  Basically, it argues that a major difference between the middle class and the top 1% is that the middle class have too much of their portfolios tied in up residential real estate that is not providing adequate returns.</p>\n<p>There is a theory out there that wealthy individuals are simply more skilled investors.  A <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2706207\">recent study</a> explains that this is not true. (In fact, they might be worse!)  Wealthy people just tend to own most of the equity in the economy, meaning that when business does well, they reap disproportionately large benefits.  Generally speaking, rich individuals own the upside of the economy in the form of stock, while the middle class’s gains are limited by the slow growth of housing wealth.  It is no surprise that the collapse of the housing bubble has exacerbated wealth inequality because stocks recovered more strongly than real estate did.  Maybe the difference between you and the 1% is just your perception of the options available to you.</p>\n<p>Surely, shelter is one of the basic necessities of life.  Everyone has to live somewhere &#8211; but taking the time to consider all of your options before making any large financial decisions is something that every person should do.  At the very least, you should consider the opportunity costs of your cash and look into advantages of a less expensive housing option, renting, or investing more in equity to ensure that you are getting the most out of your money in the long run.</p>\n<h2>At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe that real life decisions call for real life financial planning.</h2>\n<p>These are the kinds of decisions we want to help you make, so don’t hesitate to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">contact us</a> today to get started.</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

That strikes us as a conflict that is unmanageable and ultimately, comes at the cost of the client.</p>\n<p>In the fallout of the financial crisis, regulators have tried to step in over the last decade to ensure that the world of retirement advice acts without conflicts of interest, specifically by holding all financial advisors to a status of “fiduciary.”  It means that these advisors who have potential conflicts of interest will have to increase their disclosures and explain what they do for clients as it relates to advice on retirement assets.  These advisors are upset!  While they might not admit it, they are concerned that this new rule will affect their income.  The increased pressure these advisors are putting on the administration has resulted in the <a href=\"https://t.co/aOnA0Rwdda\">Labor Department seeking an 18-month delay in its implementation</a>.  While the rule is designed to protect the retirement savings of clients, the pushback could ultimately cause the rule to never get implemented.</p>\n<p>So again, where do you as a client fall in this equation?  Just how valuable is your “trusted” relationship?</p>\n<p>That is where we come in.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we have always been a fee-only fiduciary.  That means while competitors are off arguing about fees, disclosures and conflicts of interest, we already subscribe to the status of “fiduciary” and will remain unaffected by the changes.  We provide uncompromised advice and our compensation is not based on commissions or any salesmanship of a product.  The only thing we are “selling” is our best customized advice for your unique financial situation.  We believe that working with an advisor who is already committed to functioning in your best interest will give you peace of mind about your retirement savings.</p>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">reach out</a> to us anytime with questions or comments.  Unlike Matilda’s Mrs. Trunchbull, you won’t have to hunt us down.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

underestimate the adjective.</h3>\n<p>In today’s world, the rise of “robo advisors” have led some to (incorrectly) conclude that managing investment portfolios is simple.  As far as they are concerned, as long as you have a software program, you’re set.  Within minutes, a computer system can analyze your risk tolerance, determine the best investments for your unique situation and be setup to adjust it every three months if it falls out of line.  These programs provide low cost access to data-driven algorithms for trading.  We’ve discussed some of the pros and cons in our recent <a

the field of behavioral finance seeks to identify common biases that humans make when investing, including but not limited to: herd mentality, loss aversion, confirmation bias, availability bias, the disposition effect, familiarity bias and self attribution bias.  These are just some of the many important behavioral issues that the human connection you have with an advisor can help you avoid.</p>\n<p>A computer program cannot tell you that you are overreacting to a report you read on the news, or explain that chasing returns is likely not going to provide a benefit.  A computer program can’t coach you through identifying personal goals or customize budgets that will grow and change as unexpected life events pop-up.  A computer program isn’t going to give you a call when they see a red-flag in your budget or spending habits.  A computer program can’t push you to think beyond a limited scope to identify all of your goals and priorities or be there to answer the phone when you have a question.  For example: Do you want to send your kids to private school?  Do you want to be there to support your parents as they age?</p>\n<p>Don’t get us wrong: that hardly means you should shun technology.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe that a good financial advisor knows how to take the power that technology has to offer and add in all of the benefits that only a personal human connection can provide.  We believe that a good financial advisor is someone that you know and trust, who takes your financial plan as seriously as they would their own.  Here, we utilize a user-tech interface that allows our clients to manage all of the pieces of their financial plan, from cash flow to 401Ks, while allowing an experienced advisor to monitor it for new opportunities and to ensure clients are on the path to meet their goals.  That means you get access to all of their knowledge and expertise in combination with the power of technology to enhance returns, increase efficiency and provide you with flexibility and control.   As a fee-only fiduciary, we take that responsibility very seriously, and that includes taking advantage of all of the tools at our disposal.</p>\n<p>Do you feel that you are getting what you need out of your advisory relationship?  If not, we encourage you to reach out to us at anytime <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">here</a>.

How much would you say your advisor has contributed to your sense of emotional and financial well being?</p>\n<p>Most of us probably don’t ask ourselves those questions and yet, according to a 2016 Morningstar study, <a href=\"http://images.mscomm.morningstar.com/Web/MorningstarInc/%7bb87a29d4-9264-4e6f-a5d7-5e65f8714f92%7d_US_ADV_MoreLess_Whitepaper_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">When More Is Less: Rethinking Financial Health</a>, our sense of well being is an important element to consider when thinking about wealth management and financial planning.</p>\n<p>A simple way to look at financial well being is that it&#8217;s the ability to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fully meet your current and ongoing financial obligations</li>\n<li>Feel secure about your financial future</li>\n<li>Make choices that allow you to enjoy life</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Seen that way, it’s clear how feeling secure financially can contribute to our overall emotional well being as well.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <em>not</em> having a sense of overall <em>emotional</em> well being can have a negative, sabotaging effect on our financial well being, via decisions driven by anxiety, fear, insecurity, or some common behavioral biases.</p>\n<h2>Which comes first, emotional or financial well being?</h2>\n<p>The short answer is that either can.</p>\n<p>While health, family, and friends are the most important things in life, we all know that feeling anxious financially can affect our important relationships. And we know that having a sense of financial well being can give us peace of mind that lets us more fully enjoy the life and relationships we have.</p>\n<p>We also know that emotional well being &#8211; feeling emotionally secure and supported &#8211; can ground us so that we make better, more measured financial decisions. And that emotional distress can lead us to make reckless, impulsive, or biased decisions that can negatively affect achieving a secure and prosperous future.</p>\n<h2>What kinds of behaviors can derail financial well being?</h2>\n<p>Behavioral Science researchers have identified many simple yet critical attitudes and biases that can keep us from acting in our own best interest. Unconscious biases that can wreck havoc with financial well being include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The tendency for investors to react more strongly to negative news than to positive news</li>\n<li>Placing more weight – positive or negative &#8211; on current news than on the big picture</li>\n<li>A “herd mentality” that leads investors to follow the crowd, buying securities at their peak prices as a result</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What’s the first step in achieving financial well being?</h2>\n<p>A good first step towards achieving financial well being is becoming aware of the role that our emotions and biases may be playing in our financial decisions, choices, and habits. Think about your financial choices and some of the last few big financial decisions you made: were there emotions involved, however subtly, that may have influence your choices? A good Financial Advisor, particularly one well versed in Behavioral Finance, can be enormously helpful. “By identifying specific patterns of thought that may sabotage a client’s overall financial health,’” writes Sarah Newcomb, Ph.D., a behavioral scientist for Morningstar, “an advisor can help guide clients into making better financial decisions and increase their satisfaction and peace of mind.”</p>\n<p>An added benefit of identifying some of the emotions or biases that may be driving financial decisions: some of my clients have told me that discovering a bias that has affected their financial decisions has lead them to understand other ways that same bias has been affecting their life as well!</p>\n<p>Nothing beats a sense of well being, and feeling more secure financially definitely contributes to a greater overall sense of well being and peace of mind. And emotional wellbeing – along with a good financial advisor &#8211; can keep you from sabotaging your own progress, and put you back in control and on your way to achieving your financial goals.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

According to a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/podcasts/how-much-do-you-really-pay-your-financial-adviser/D6E453D8-C530-4029-B99B-7821F499F3B2.html\">recent podcast</a> from the Wall Street Journal, it’s not only <em>how much</em> you pay – but also what you are paying <em>for</em> – that’s a source of communication breakdown between those clients and their advisors.</p>\n<p>While the Department of Labor is pushing to get advisors and brokers to make it easier for clients to understand their fee structures, so far it doesn’t look like many of the bigger firms are taking them up on it.</p>\n<p>Since any firm or advisor can <em>claim</em> to be client-driven, transparent, and “fee-based,” how can you be completely sure about what you’re getting and how much you’re paying? If your advisor is fee-based, rather than strictly fee-only, they may be earning commissions when they recommend certain investment products. Obviously, that creates a potential conflict of interest: those advisors have incentives to trade more frequently, and to recommend specific products in order to generate higher commissions for themselves and their firm, whether or not they’re best for you.</p>\n<p>One way to avoid uncertainty – and the potential headaches it brings – is to work with a <em>fee-only</em> registered investment advisory firm (RIA). Fee-only RIAs and advisors do not earn commissions so they are <em>not</em> motivated by the frequency of trades, so they are less likely to encourage buying and selling unless it’s the best choice for you. Because RIAs are held to a fiduciary standard, they are legally bound to always – and only &#8211; act in your best interest.</p>\n<h2>Do your advisor&#8217;s feed include additional services?</h2>\n<p>Even if you are working with a fee-only RIA, however, you may be still not getting your full money’s worth. Many clients neglect to take advantage of untapped services that are included in their advisor’s fees, such as tax and estate planning, insurance advice, and financial coaching, among other services. If you’re not sure what additional services your advisor – or the advisors you are considering – provide, ask them. It’s the best way to ensure that there’s an open path of communication and that you are getting the most value out of your wealth management experience.</p>\n<p>Only you can decide what kind of fee structure is best for you, what you feel is the appropriate amount to spend on investment management and financial planning, and what additional services are important to you to help you grow your wealth.</p>\n<p>If you’re concerned you’re not getting your money’s worth, though, or that you’re paying too much, here are some good questions to ask yourself: How adequately served do you think you are? Are you confused with what services you are getting and what you are paying for? Do you feel valued? Are your goals being met and are you being listened to?</p>\n<p>If you’re not satisfied with the answers to any of these questions, remember that you have options. Sherman Wealth Management is proud to be a fee-only independent RIA firm, because we feel it is the best way to meet our ethical standards and guarantee that all potential clients have a simple and cost-effective way to access investment management and financial planning.</p>\n<p>Knowing what those options are, and getting clarity in your fee structures – whatever kind of advisor you ultimately choose &#8211; will allow you to feel more confident about the decisions you make, now and for your future.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/are-you-getting-you-moneys-worth-financial-advice/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Sound like a hard idea to sell to kids in vacation mode? Not if you make it a rewarding part of summer fun. Here are some tips to incorporate smart money lessons for kids from K-12 that will add to their summer fun and set a great foundation for making smart money choices later on.</p>\n<h3>SAVING</h3>\n<p>Ask your kids to set aside part their allowance for a special summer savings goal then sweeten the pot by telling them you’ll match whatever they save. For the little ones it could be as simple as setting up 2 jars, one for their summer goal (like a super-soaker, hula hoop, or the ingredients for s’mores) and one for the rest of their allowance. They’ll love seeing the jars fill up with coins and counting and re-counting their money. For older kids who are saving for a concert ticket or a tattoo (just kidding!), an app or a website that keeps track of their savings and your matching funds is a great way of getting them interested.</p>\n<h3>EARNING</h3>\n<p>Nothing like learning the satisfaction of having your “own” money! Even if your older children have an actual summer job, consider “hiring” them for extra chores like organizing your photo files, digitizing old cassettes and CDs, or washing the windows. For the little ones, watering plants, pulling up 20 weeds (counting skills!) or helping you rinse the car can help add their allowance jars.</p>\n<h3>INVESTING</h3>\n<p>There are fun games to teach kids of all ages about the stock market, investing, and the power of compound interest (like <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media/game-0007-invest-quest\">InvestQuest</a> from the FTC.) The best way of course, though, is to follow the real stock market. Why not have every family member invest a virtual $1000 in 2 companies whose products they know at the beginning of the summer (Lego and Disney for the younger kids, for instance) and see who ends up with the most virtual profit by the end of the summer. Or, if you have the resources, open accounts for the kids with real investments, however small, so they can watch them go up and down, while earning interest, over the months and years ahead. The SEC&#8217;s site <a href=\"https://investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator\">Investor.gov</a> has a great compound interest generator to show kids how their money could grow.</p>\n<h3>SPENDING</h3>\n<p>Summer is also a great time to teach kids about comparison shopping, supply and demand, and the power of buying things when they are on sale. Keeping track of what you save each time you buy a sale-priced item this summer can be an eye-opening for your kids. As you enjoy vacation trips, or even day trips to waterparks, let your kids know about the <em>value</em> you are getting (rather than complaining about high prices.) Give the kids a choice when possible, telling them how much you have to spend for the day and ask their input about how to spend it. When they know that buying cotton candy means they are giving up two rides they learn a valuable lesson about resource allocation!</p>\n<h3>READING</h3>\n<p>Find great books to read or listen to in the car about entrepreneurs’ success stories. Young children will enjoy books about Thomas Edison, for instance, or Alexander Who Used to Be Rich Last Sunday. Try a biography of Steve Jobs for the teens, or check out finance videos from Khan Academy.</p>\n<h3>PAYING</h3>\n<p>Take a moment to explain what you’re paying for when you’re paying bills: show your kids how the electric bills soar in the summer if you’re use air conditioning or your water bill if you’re watering the lawn. Calculate – or Google &#8211; how much it costs when they leave lights on. Not exactly entertaining but an empowering eye-opener for kids.</p>\n<h3>PLAYING</h3>\n<p>Nothing like a great game of Monopoly to while away summer nights while teaching kids about saving up for those houses and hotels (including our favorite trick: hiding money under the board so no one sees how much you are accumulating!)</p>\n<p>In short, if you treat money matter-of-factly &#8211; and build in some challenges, competition, and entertainment &#8211; summer can be a great time to sneak in a little fun “schooling” that will help prepare kids for an empowered future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * * * *</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

For parents of younger children, however, those happy announcements may make them wonder if they are being savvy about starting to save for college.</p>\n<p>One thing any parent will tell you is that time flies. Before you know it, your toddler will be taking the SATs. And one thing any financial advisor will tell you is that the earlier you start <em>any</em> savings plan, the better off you’ll be (although any time is better than no time.)</p>\n<h2><strong>Not all college savings plans are created equal</strong></h2>\n<p>The good news is that more parents than ever are already saving, including an impressive 65% of young millennial parents, according to Sallie Mae’s 2016 report <em>How America Saves for College</em>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, 61% of the parents surveyed said they are putting their savings in regular savings accounts, and a whopping 44% of all money saved is held in savings &amp; checking accounts, CDs, savings bonds and other low-yielding instruments. And too many of the non-savers are hoping that earnings from their own investments or savings will cover college.</p>\n<p>So what are the best ways to save for your child’s education?</p>\n<h2><strong>Better Ways to Save &#8211; 529s, ESAs, and UTMAs</strong></h2>\n<p>With the availability of excellent plans with significant tax benefits and the potential for compound interest gains, why are so few parents taking advantage of them? One reason may be that the various plans, while excellent, are not always easy to understand. Even the alphabet soup of names is daunting when you’re also worried about packing lunches, soccer practice, and missing work for parent teacher conferences.</p>\n<p>Here’s a simplified look at the top plans:</p>\n<h2><strong>529 Plans</strong></h2>\n<p>While 529 plans have been around since 1996, they still seem to be a well-kept secret, with only 22% of college savings invested in these portfolios of investment funds (here too, savvy Millennials are leading the charge with 44% planning to take advantage of 529 plans, while Gen X and Baby Boomer parents trail at 36% and 23%.)</p>\n<p>529 plans are offered by each of the 50 states and allow you deposit post-tax money that grows and compounds tax-free. While you can invest in any state’s plan, investing in your own state’s plan may offer state income tax deductions in addition to the federal tax break for earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Anyone can create a 529 account (including the future student) and anyone can add up to $14,000 per year to the account (or $28,000 if married) without paying a federal gift tax. Up to a total of $400,000 can be invested in a 529 plan account per beneficiary (each state sets its own limits) and for most plans there is no age restriction for the beneficiary. <span id=\"UXUtVblr\" class=\"zgmOJOUauG\">They also allow withdrawals to pay for educational supplies such as computers and books, and the account owner can change the beneficiary to another eligible family member if the funds aren’t used.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks</strong>: when you invest in a state plan, you do not control the financial decisions. Instead, you invest in the portfolio of funds offered by the plan. So shop around for the state plan you feel most comfortable with and that best matches your risk tolerance (a good Fiduciary Financial Advisor can help you evaluate the choices.)</p>\n<h2><strong>Coverdell Educational Savings Accounts (ESAs)</strong></h2>\n<p>ESA accounts are similar to a 529 plan in that you contribute post-tax money then growth in value is tax-free. Unlike 529 plans, however, you are free to invest the money as you please.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> You control the investments in the account and, like 529 plans, can use the funds to pay for educational supplies such as computers and books. You can also use ESA funds to pay for K-12 costs if your child goes to a private school. Any funds not used, may be rolled, tax-free, into the ESA of another family member.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks:</strong> Contributions are capped at $2000 per year per beneficiary and must come from contributors whose adjusted gross income for that year is less than $110,000 (or $220,000 for individuals filing joint returns) so this option is not available to higher income contributors. The beneficiary must be under 18 when it the ESA is created and funded, and the funds must be used by age 30 or be subject to federal tax and a 10% penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong>UGMA/UTMA Custodial Accounts</strong></h2>\n<p>The UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Act) and UTMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) allow larger gifts to be made to minors, while still qualifying for gift tax exclusion. They allow a parent or grandparent to reduce their estate for tax purposes with greater flexibility in how the money is invested than a 529 offers.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Custodial accounts have the greatest flexibility. You can contribute as much as you want, invest it as you please, and &#8211; while 529 accounts and ESAs are exclusively intended for education expenses &#8211; funds in a custodial accounts can be used for any purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks:</strong> Unlike 529 plans and ESAs, the earnings are not tax-free. And, while custodian controls how the funds are used while the student is a minor, after the student turns 21 (or 18 in some states,) control is transferred to the student. Another important consideration for both taxes and financial aid applications is that custodial accounts are considered the child’s assets and the income they produce (over $1,050 and up to $2,100) will be taxed as income to the child, then any earnings beyond that are taxed at your rate.</p>\n<h2><strong>Prepaid tuition plans</strong></h2>\n<p>If you live in a state with excellent state schools, prepaid tuition plans may be a smart solution for you. Administered by the individual states, these investment accounts allow you to pay for – or contribute to &#8211; your child&#8217;s future state school tuition at today&#8217;s rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Paying now is a great hedge against rising college costs and the increase in value is not taxed.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks</strong>: The funds can only be used at state schools and do not cover room and board.</p>\n<h2><strong>Get a head start on your child’s financial education too</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve chose the plan – or combination &#8211; that makes the most sense for you, it’s a smart idea to share your investment plan with your child, as soon as they&#8217;re old enough to understand. If you get them started early understanding the power of planning, saving, and compound interest, they’ll already have an A+ in financial literacy when they get into the college of their dreams.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\"><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/advisors/54337/brad-sherman/\">Investopedia</a>.</em></div>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This was clearly good news for investors. Adoption has now been delayed, however, and the future of this consumer protection is not clear.</p>\n<h2>Fiduciary means “Trust”</h2>\n<p>The word “Fiduciary” (from a the Latin word for “something inspiring trust”) describes a category of registered independent investment advisors who – like Sherman Wealth &#8211; are required to act <em>solely</em> and <em>exclusively</em> in the best interest of their clients. Our decisions are not colored by any expectation of additional income from the products we recommend.</p>\n<h2>Don’t all advisors work in their clients best interests?</h2>\n<p>Not necessarily. While it seems obvious that giving you the best advice is what you expect your advisor to do – it’s what you <u>pay</u> them for after all &#8211; broker-dealers are not required to operate as fiduciaries.</p>\n<p>Broker-dealers have only been required to recommend products that are deemed a “suitable” choice for a client, not necessarily the <em>best</em> choice. Broker dealers can therefore recommend investments they receive commissions for selling or that their firm has an interest in, <em>whether or not they are the best choice for you.</em></p>\n<p>Let’s put it this way: as long as their recommendations are <em>in </em>the ballpark, they don’t have to aim for hitting it <em>out of</em> the park for you.</p>\n<h2>The new fiduciary rule should be a win-win, right?</h2>\n<p>Again, not necessarily. The new rule, which was passed under the previous administration, was set to go into effect this week and would have required the widespread adoption of the fiduciary rule for investment accounts and assets.</p>\n<p>That would have given investors greater protection and greater confidence in the advice they are getting from their advisors.</p>\n<p>The DOL has delayed the date of adoption until June 9, however, as the result of an executive order by the new administration. The current administration says it needs time to examine and review it, given, among other things, the Financial Industry’s concerns about costs to them, including the money they are earning on commissions from clients like you.</p>\n<h2>How does this affect your Financial Future?</h2>\n<p>If you are already working with a fiduciary, not at all. You are already covered, for <em>all</em> aspects of your investments, not just retirement funds.</p>\n<p>If you are <em>not</em> already with a fiduciary advisor, even if the new rule is adopted in some form or another, it only applies to retirement investments and potentially not the full spectrum of your investing strategy, so you are still not getting the most transparent, trustworthy advice you can.</p>\n<h2>What should you do to insure you’re getting conflict-free advice?</h2>\n<p>Find out if your investor is a fee-only Fiduciary. Ask them. They are required to tell you. And don’t be fooled by “fee-based.” A true fiduciary does not take commissions and is conflict-of-interest free.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the DOL will act in the best interest of consumers and investors. Even if the future of the new ruling is unclear, you can protect yourself by working with one of the many advisories that has – like Sherman Wealth &#8211; <em>already</em> adopted the Fiduciary Standard for all investment categories.</p>\n<p>At Sherman Wealth we are proud to operate as fee-only fiduciaries, which means that our decisions are based on <em>your</em> goals, <em>your</em> risk tolerance, and <em>your</em> plan. Nothing more and nothing less. We couldn’t imagine bringing anything but our best advice to our clients’ financial futures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********</p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Don’t start to build from the roof down, though: make sure that you’re laying a strong financial foundation.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/8-financial-mistakes-avoid-20s-30s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our last post</a> we talked about 8 Financial Mistakes to Avoid in Your 20s and 30s. Here are five more money mistakes to watch out for:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Going on a Financial Blind Date With Your Significant Other: Not Having the Money Talk First</strong></h4>\n<p>Talking about money isn’t romantic and can be downright uncomfortable. That’s why many couples go into marriage—a financial partnership—without knowing exactly who they are partnering with. Discussing personal finances, debt, goals, spending patterns and how you make financial decisions with your partner before marriage, or soon thereafter, is critical to your short- and long-term financial health. (For related reading, see: Don&#8217;t Let Financial Differences Lead to Divorce.)</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Living la Vida Loca: Splurging on the Wedding or a Baby</strong></h4>\n<p>Important milestones like a wedding, a first child or even your first house are exciting and make precious memories that last a lifetime. But be careful not to let them put you in debt or divert you from a financial plan that allows you to make other great memories down the road. Know what you can afford, get creative within your budget, and make sure you’re investing in your partner’s and children’s future as well. The kids won’t mind—or even remember—that you didn’t buy them that top-of-the-line stroller. What they’ll remember is your smile and their favorite red ball. #Priceless</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Not Buckling Your Seat Belt: Neglecting Insurance</strong></h4>\n<p>It’s tempting to skimp on insurance once you’ve covered your basic health and homeowner’s policies, but that’s a big mistake many young adults make. Insurance is an uncomfortable topic—and the options can be very confusing—so covering yourself with health, life, car, home, disability and long-term disability insurance often gets put on the back burner. Cover yourself adequately now so that when the unexpected happens, it’s not a financial disaster. (For related reading, see: Introduction to Insurance.)</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Going for the Gold: Taking a Job for the Pay</strong></h4>\n<p>While a great offer is always tempting, make sure that any job you take is something that will advance you in the direction you want to go. Don&#8217;t take a job just because the money is great, although that’s important too. If you do, you could get stuck in a job you don’t love with nowhere to go. Take a job that is going to move you closer to the job you want—and the even-higher salary you want—in a couple of years.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Putting Too Many Eggs in the Wrong Basket: Not Prioritizing Savings</strong></h4>\n<p>Maxing out your 401(k) or IRA is smart, but don’t forget to save for other major purchases that may be coming up sooner than you think, like buying a new home, having children, or continuing your education. Multiple savings accounts can be a great way to keep your eye on multiple baskets! Be careful, too, not to prioritize your children’s education over saving for your own retirement. Student loans are less expensive than the kind of loans your kids would have to take out to support you if you haven’t set enough savings aside to support your own retirement.</p>\n<p>Enjoy this special time, living your life to the fullest. If you make sure you&#8217;re also making smart financial choices, you&#8217;ll <em>really</em> enjoy your 20s and 30s, knowing that you&#8217;re building a solid future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You’re starting to build the life you envision for yourself, or perhaps you’re still seeking out new experiences to learn more about yourself and your goals.</p>\n<p>These are years when we expect to learn and grow by exploring jobs and careers, cultural experiences, social experiences and other educational opportunities. But too many of us forget to explore and master one of the most critical parts of building the future we want: financial literacy and financial planning.</p>\n<p>The result is that many people enjoy their 20s and make important life changes in their 30s (or vice versa) without understanding how best to support their career and personal goals with a rock-solid financial plan. You could end up flying high, but forget to build a safety net!</p>\n<p>Here are some key mistakes to avoid as you’re getting started:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. </strong><strong>Letting the Chips Fall Where They May: No Budget</strong></h4>\n<p>A first job—or second, or third—is a great feeling. You’re earning money and it’s yours to spend. And too often, we spend it until it’s gone. While a budget may sound restrictive, it actually gives you more freedom because it keeps you from overspending in areas you don’t care about so you have the money you need for what’s important. <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/120816/3-ways-make-budgeting-success-new-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A budget helps you understand where to splurge</a>—on quality that lasts longer, for instance—and where it’s best to economize, such as buying a used car instead of a new one.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Keeping Too Low of a Profile: No Credit Rating</strong></h4>\n<p>Many people just starting out have low credit ratings, or worse, no credit rating at all (if you’ve always used your parents credit cards, for instance). With a low credit score, your costs will be higher for things like insurance, car financing and mortgage rates. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building good credit now</a>, by getting your own credit card and paying it diligently, or even getting a credit-building loan, will establish a good rating that will help you down the road.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Putting It off Until Tomorrow: Living on Credit Cards</strong></h4>\n<p>Credit cards can be a godsend, particularly the ones with loyalty points. But those points pale in value beside the damage that finance charges can do. Do treat your credit cards like a smart way to keep track of your spending, but don’t spend more than you actually have. Paying credit cards off in full each month not only keeps you within your budget and keeps you from accruing finance charges, it also helps you build a great credit rating for when you do need to borrow money. (For related reading, see: 10 Reasons to Use Your Credit Card.)</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Living on Perks Instead of Salary: Not Paying Yourself First</strong></h4>\n<p>We’ve all been to that job interview where they say that the salary is low but they have a great exercise room, volleyball team and popcorn machine. That popcorn won’t pay the rent and it won’t pay a down payment when you find that great condo. Create a savings plan and pay yourself first before you splurge on lifestyle perks like vacations and expensive shoes. That plan should include saving for short-term goals, saving for an emergency fund, and starting to save for retirement. While retirement may seem a long way off, the earlier you start, the more you harness the power of compound interest. Make sure your budget includes saving and contributing, on a regular basis no matter how small the amount, to an IRA or 401(k) before you start spending.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Living on the Edge: No Emergency Fund</strong></h4>\n<p>While it’s hard to imagine needing emergency funds when you’re young and just starting out, you never know what the future can bring. Crises like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 crash left a lot of people struggling without a safety net, but even something as simple as a pet’s sudden illness can present a huge challenge when you’re on a tight budget. Try to start contributing to an emergency fund that you keep in highly liquid funds for when the unexpected happens. (For related reading, see: Building an Emergency Fund.)</p>\n<h4><strong>6. Playing the Odds: No Health Insurance</strong></h4>\n<p>Many young people who are in peak health think that they can skip—or skimp—on health insurance. While you may indeed be fit and healthy, that doesn’t protect you from potential sports injuries, appendicitis, bouts with the flu or—perish the thought—a car accident. High medical bills are the biggest cause of personal bankruptcy. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/back-basics-insurance-cheat-sheet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get the best coverage you can afford</a>: you’ll be amazed how quickly it pays for itself.</p>\n<h4><strong>7. Going With the Flow: Not Setting Financial Goals</strong></h4>\n<p>“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you’re heading,” goes the famous quote attributed to Lao Tzu. That means it’s a good idea to think about where you’d like to be—in a year, in five years, in 20 years—and make sure that’s the path you’re on. Simple goals like “I want to save $20.00 a week,” or more elaborate ones, like “I’d like to work for myself from a house on the beach,” all begin with awareness and taking the first small steps. <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/100616/dont-let-emotions-hinder-your-investing-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Set a few goals</a>; you can always change them later, but if you don’t, you’re drifting without being mindful of where the currents are taking you.</p>\n<h4><strong>8. Taking Your Eye off the Ball: Using a Non-Fiduciary Advisor or Commission-Based Investment Site</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/age_vs_risk_tolerance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">It’s never too late</a> to become financially literate. The internet is full of great tips (like these) and sites that can help you organize your finances, and it provides access to a range of advisories. Having a financial advisor guide you is an excellent idea but blindly trusting just anyone can be dangerous. Many non-fiduciary advisors are compensated by the financial products they recommend, products that may not be the best ones for you. Make sure the advisor you consult is a fiduciary, i.e. someone who is legally obligated to only recommend options that are in your best interest.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our next post: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-more-financial-mistakes/\">5 More Financial Mistakes to Avoid</a>.

The increase in the banks’ rate is then passed on to <em>their</em> borrowers, through climbing interest rates on things like credit-card debt, car loans, home equity loans and mortgages.</p>\n<p>This means borrowers may already be feeling a small, but still noteworthy pinch, when it comes to interest on their loans.</p>\n<p>No need to panic though: it doesn&#8217;t need to mean turbulent waters ahead. Taking a look at whether your own financial goals and strategies need to be adjusted will help you stay on track for your own future.</p>\n<h3>How will the hike affect you?</h3>\n<p>The relationship between the economy and interest rates is so complex that even experts sometimes find it daunting. That said, there are a few key action items to consider when interest rates start to rise:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong> 1. Refinancing options for existing loans</strong></p>\n<p>It might be time to consider refinancing to lock into current rates before they begin increasing, including rates on your mortgage, home equity loan, and car loans. Make sure you know which of your loans are adjustable or floating, and discuss with your advisor on what your options are to potentially minimize any increasing costs.</p>\n<p><strong> 2. Your debt payoff strategy and schedule</strong></p>\n<p>Do the math and decide whether it makes sense to reallocate funds and increase your monthly debt payments. By paying more on your loans you reduce the principal quicker and therefore accrue less interest payments over the life of the loan. Your financial advisor may suggest that your investment gains may still offer the potential to offset any interest rate increase however there are many things to consider before making any adjustments (see our risk tolerance point below).</p>\n<p><strong> 3. Bank and credit card balance transfers </strong></p>\n<p>It is always a good idea to shop around for the most favorable credit card and bank rates, particularly if interest rates are about to rise.</p>\n<p><strong> 4. Your risk tolerance</strong></p>\n<p>It is a great time to sit down with your financial advisor and determine whether the level of risk you are comfortable with has changed in light of an expectation of rising interest rates and determine if it is time to rebalance your portfolio or make any adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong> 5. Your budget </strong></p>\n<p>Rising interest rates and a strengthening economy may lead to an increase in the prices for everyday items including gas, groceries, and entertainment. Take a look at your spending and make any adjustments necessary so that you can stay on track with your savings plan.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What’s the good news?</h3>\n<p>By raising rates, the Fed is signaling its confidence that the economy is strengthening, which is great news if you have clearly defined goals and a diversified portfolio.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for these possible benefits:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong> 1. Interest rates on your savings accounts could increase</strong></p>\n<p>While banks tend to raise interest rates on deposits more slowly than on loans, you may see the interest rates applied to your savings accounts increase over time.</p>\n<p><strong> 2. Incentives to buy a home now</strong></p>\n<p>The specter of rising rates could be just the incentive you need to switch from renting to owning your own home.</p>\n<p><strong> 3. Increasing employment rates and salaries</strong></p>\n<p>The Fed has communicated that it believes the economy will continue to improve and that &#8220;labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.&#8221; That is good news because continued growth could mean more jobs and rising wages.</p>\n<p><strong> 4. More business</strong></p>\n<p>A more robust economy may also lead to more consumer confidence , driving more customers, clients, or contracts to your business and this additional business could offset the less desirable attributes of rising rates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Take a look, then take it in stride!</h3>\n<p>March’s rate hike, while small, was an indication that the Federal Reserve is slowly downshifting the stimulus policies it put in place after the financial crisis of 2008. It also indicates confidence that the economy is growing and will continue to grow, at least in the near future.</p>\n<p>Take a look at your savings plan, your investment portfolio, and your risk tolerance with your advisor, and see if you need to make any necessary adjustments.</p>\n<p>With proper diversification, goal-setting, and the help of a Fiduciary financial advisor, you can stay on track to achieving you and your family’s financial goals despite a potentially more costly borrowing environment.</p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

The statistics are alarming, but perhaps not surprising. How we handle money is not usually a topic of that comes up while we are dating. As a result most couples don’t discuss financial compatibility before saying “I do”. When the honeymoon is over, though, and the bills start rolling in, couples often experience a reality check. While love is grand, it can’t pay the bills so it may not take long before fights erupt over different money habits.</p>\n<p>Part of the problem is that it is simply uncomfortable to talk about money. Whether we like it or not, we tend to tie our own feelings of self-worth to money matters. It’s not uncommon to see how much money we make as a direct reflection of how much we are contributing to the relationship. These feelings can become further complicated if there have been financial missteps along the way. While avoiding conversations about money can allow us live in a blissful state of denial for a while, the long-term consequences can be life-altering.</p>\n<p>The good news is that it is never too late to make meaningful changes and save a marriage that is threatened by financial discord.</p>\n<p>According to financial planners who work with couples, money conflicts fall under five main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Differences in spending and saving habits</li>\n<li>Disagreements about who should control the money</li>\n<li>Differences in priorities</li>\n<li>Dishonesty about debt and habits</li>\n<li>Differences in risk profiles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you are experiencing frustration around one of these issues or all five, there are ways to build better financial health as a couple and avoid relationship problems.</p>\n<h2>Effective Communication Leads to Greater Financial Success</h2>\n<p>Effective communication can make a world of difference when it comes to financial matters. Establishing trust, which is cultivated through honest communication, is key. Trust is built when each partner commits to openly expressing their feelings about money and listening to what the other partner has to say. This includes being willing to reveal financial failures, knowing that your partner will be forgiving and withhold judgment.</p>\n<h2>Be Willing to Compromise</h2>\n<p>Although it is easier said than done, another key to resolving money issues is compromise. The first step is for both partners to sit down and agree on a common set of financial goals and what steps they will take to meet those mutual goals. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/3-ways-make-budgeting-success-new-year/\">Establishing a family budget</a> &#8211; and committing to it – is critical. That budget should include some freedom for spending on things that are important to both partners, regardless of who is earning more money.</p>\n<h2>Be Patient</h2>\n<p>As you begin the process of rehabilitating your financial health and establishing clear lines of communication with your partner, remember to be patient. Keep in mind that spending habits are deeply ingrained in each of us. Both you and your partner have been influenced by your parents’ habits and your approach to money has been formed over a lifetime of experiences.</p>\n<h2>Enlist the Help of a Financial Planner</h2>\n<p>Whether you need help mediating tough conversations or you want expert advice on how to establish a budget that will help you meet your financial goals, don’t try to go it alone. Work with a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">financial advisor</a> who can offer helpful insights and steer you in the right direction. With the right help, you can get back on track financially and strengthen your relationship. If you are to the point where money issues are creating such a strain on your marriage that you are considering divorce, outside intervention from an experienced financial advisor can be critically important in finding solutions that work for both of you.</p>\n<h2>Avoid Conflict</h2>\n<p>Often couples will argue about whether they should give or loan money to family members. While each case is different, and very personal, it is generally a good idea to try to avoid making these kinds of loans. Once that first loan is made, you have set a precedent and you are more than likely to receive follow-up request for additional money. While it can be difficult to say no to friends and family, it is always in your financial best interest to avoid these types of transactions.</p>\n<h2>A Happy Ending</h2>\n<p>Even in the best marriages, there are bound to be differences over finances, but those disagreements don’t have to drive a wedge between you and your partner, or worse, lead to divorce. If you actively work to establish trust through open and honest communication and recognize when it is time to seek outside help from a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor, you are taking important steps to letting your financial life be a solid foundation for your marriage – and not the wall between you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********</p>\n<h6><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://ow.ly/iMld309YGqU\">Investopedia</a>.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

While most people start families in their 20s or 30s, you might be that 40-year-old who’s just about to adopt a first child. And while most 60-year-olds have hopefully accumulated some retirement savings, you might be that entrepreneurial baby boomer who is moving to Detroit to launch a startup or open a coffee bar.</p>\n<p>In spite of this brave, and exciting, new world of personal choices, what’s the first question a financial advisor or online financial site generally asks you? Chances are it’s your age. Then that answer determines the next question, and the next.</p>\n<p>Too many financial planners and investment sites, unfortunately, use age to make assumptions that then dictate investment recommendations.</p>\n<p>The internet, too, is filled with articles like “Financial Planning Tips Every 30-year-old should know” and “The best financial goals for every age.” There are books and studies that break your life down into age-based phases like “early career phase” and “peak accumulation phase” then make generalization based on those neat buckets.</p>\n<h3><strong>What’s more important than age?</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re all individuals, with different dreams, goals, and life situations and when it comes to financial planning, age is not as important as it used to be.</p>\n<p>Your goals and your risk tolerance should be the factors to consider first in devising a personalized financial plan or investment plan that works for you.</p>\n<p>Is your primary goal buying a house, is it wealth creation for early retirement, is it having income so you can bike around the world for a year? Those answers are more important than the fact that you are 32.</p>\n<p>Does a volatile stock market make you anxious? Do you prefer slow and steady to winner takes all? While it’s generally assumed that young people can afford greater risk and volatility because they have time on their side, you may be that 24 year old that wants or needs to preserve savings first and foremost.</p>\n<p>Goals differ and investment always involves a certain amount of risk. That’s why a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor works with each client individually to manage goals and risk in a way that works for them. It is vital for success to determine the level of risk each client can afford to take, how much risk is necessary to help them achieve their personal goals, and how much risk and volatility they can comfortably live with emotionally.</p>\n<h3><strong>You Are Unique</strong></h3>\n<p>Each of us is unique and that means that no two people will have the exact same goals + risk profile, in spite of being the same age. Yes, living off retirement savings is different than living off a first salary, but the amount may be the same. And paying off student loans is really not all that different from paying off a mortgage.</p>\n<p>What’s important is that you find a good fee-only fiduciary financial advisor who looks beyond pre-programmed, one-size-fits all recommendations for 20-30 year-olds or 60+ year-olds and focuses to your goals, your risk preferences, and your uniqueness to create a personalized plan that works for you and evolves as you evolve, not one designed for an entire generation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/020617/your-financial-plan-depends-more-your-age/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You’re not alone. Financial planning jargon can be daunting when you’re just getting started.</p>\n<p>Understanding the difference between Fee-Only and Fee-Based, however, is important and could be the key to your long-term planning success.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Fee-Only Financial Planning?</strong></h2>\n<p>Fee-Only financial planners are legally registered as investment advisors and have a <em>fiduciary responsibility</em> to you to create a plan in your best interest. Fee-only advisors cannot accept any compensation as a result of product sales. In other words, they can’t make a commission from specific investments they recommend you purchase. They are paid directly by you – and only by you &#8211; either through an hourly fee, a retainer fee, or an agreed-upon percentage of your assets that they manage.</p>\n<p>As a result, in most cases, Fee-Only advisors have fewer conflicts of interest. They are more focused on <em>your</em> needs, rather than on selling you specific investments, since their compensation is not determined by sales volume or choice. A Fee-Only advisor will not try to steer you toward commissioned annuities; a Fee-Only planner’s advice must be completely free of attachment to financial products. The role of Fee-Only advisors is to only provide you advice that fits <em>your</em> current financial situation and your goals and therefore not recommend products and services that don’t support that goal and that are not the best choices for you.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Fee-Based Planning?</strong></h2>\n<p>“Fee-Based” is a category the brokerage community has created to take advantage of the success – and attractiveness &#8211; of Fee-Only advising. Because the terms sound so similar, it’s easy to think they are similar, but there is a major difference between Fee-Based planning and Fee-Only planning.</p>\n<p>In Fee-Based planning, the advisor is compensated with a set percentage of your assets instead of a retainer or a flat hourly fee. In addition to that percentage, Fee-based advisors can also accept commissions from financial products, annuities, and insurance products they sell you. Each time you purchase one of those products, their earnings increase.</p>\n<p>This leads to a fundamental conflict of interest. Your advisor wants to earn as much as possible while you want someone to provide honest and trustworthy guidance.</p>\n<p>If one fund offers advisors a significant commission and another one doesn’t but is better for you and your financial goals, how likely is it that the advisor will forego the opportunity to earn the commission by recommending the better fund?</p>\n<p>That is why the legally-binding Fiduciary Rule that Fee-Only Advisors follow is so important: the definition of a fiduciary relationship is one based on trust.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Make Sure Your Advisor is Fee-Only</strong></h2>\n<p>Before selecting an advisor, ask how and what their compensation plan looks like. Ask them to disclose what their compensation fees are in writing and whether or not they accept commissions. By choosing an advisor who provides Fee-Only services, you stand a greater chance of avoiding any conflicts of interests. Remember, Fee-Based advisors are obligated by their brokers or by specific deals to sell certain products. Fee-Only advisors are under no such requirements and have a legal, fiduciary, obligation to work for <em>you</em>, and you only.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/012017/paying-financial-advice-feeonly-vs-feebased/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

As Barry Ritholz noted in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/get-there/what-history-tells-us-about-your-investments-in-2017/2016/12/30/1e4c5714-cc4d-11e6-a87f-b917067331bb_story.html\">excellent piece</a> in the Washington Post last week, during President Grover Cleveland’s first term stocks rose 53 percent while in his second term they fell 2 percent. That wasn’t because President Cleveland forgot how to make stocks go up – it was overall market drivers that made a difference. So for medium and long-term goals – like saving for retirement or your children’s education – taking the long view with your investments is critical.</p>\n<h2>How Much Risk is Too Much?</h2>\n<p>The second point is that everyone has a different level of risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>That is why it’s critical that you have access to a sophisticated risk tolerance tool that really drills down to who <em>you</em> are, instead of only generic questions about age, income and whether or not you call yourself “aggressive” or “cautious.”</p>\n<p>If you’re risk adverse and you’re anxious about a crash or a downward trend that may affect your short term plans, you can always use January to re-balance your portfolio and lock in profits. As a wise investor once said: “no one ever lost money taking a profit.” If your risk tolerance is higher, you can view the volatility as an opportunity to maximize the possible potential for your investments. By continuing to contribute regularly to a savings or investment plan, you take advantage of the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/#sthash.URdSwiaq.dpuf\">dollar-cost averaging and compounded interest</a> to make your money work for you. If you had sold in the sharp downturn last January, for instance, instead of sticking to your plan, you would have lost out on the dramatic returns afterwards.</p>\n<p>Of course every January is a good time to meet with your advisor to rebalance your portfolio based on your own changing circumstances, tax needs, and risk tolerance. But, fundamentally, your plan is still <em>your</em> plan, no matter who wins the presidential election. Your goals are still <em>your</em> goals and compound interest <em>still</em> compounds. If you have worked with a good – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\">fiduciary, fee only &#8211; financial advisor</a> to create a workable plan based on <em>your</em> life goals and <em>your</em> circumstances, then staying the course – with minor adjustments – is very often the smartest plan.

It’s a time we engage in self-reflection, ideas for self-improvement, and new – or ongoing – resolutions and goals.</p>\n<p>One of the most common resolutions is losing weight, but we all know how that goes: crowded gyms in early January, inevitable drop-off when February rolls around. In fact, a <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/\"><u>study</u></a> done by the University of Scranton shows that only about 8% of people actually achieve their resolutions.</p>\n<p>Financial resolutions often include starting – or finally sticking to &#8211; a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp\">budget</a>. Unfortunately, that resolution is all-too-often hard to stick to as well. (For related reading, see <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/newyear.asp\"><em>Financial New Year&#8217;s Resolutions You Can Keep</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Why do so many people have trouble sticking to their resolutions? One of the main reasons is having unrealistic expectations. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><u>Overconfidence</u></a> doesn’t just affect fitness goals, it affects investors’ behavior as well.</p>\n<p>How can you make this the year you stick to your goals?</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Take Baby Steps</h2>\n<p>Be reasonable in assessing where you are with your finances and don’t try to tackle everything at once. Start by listing all the areas of your financial situation you would like to improve. Then prioritize the individual elements in order of importance to you, and start by taking on one or two at a time. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/102516/achieve-your-financial-goals-financial-plan/\"><em>Achieve Your Financial Goals With a Financial Plan</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>If one of your goals is to start &#8211; and stick to &#8211; budgeting, don’t give yourself super-strict boundaries. Instead, start by creating good habits one at a time. If you want to pay off all of your <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp\">credit card debt</a>, for instance, take a look at how much debt you have and create a <u>realistic</u> weekly or monthly plan to start paying it off. If you want to buy a house in five years, you could decide to spend less now on something that you currently enjoy. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/091916/got-raise-heres-how-avoid-lifestyle-creep/\"><em>Got a Raise? Here’s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Focus on one or two goals at a time, see how it goes, and make progress – and adjustments – to stay on track.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Be Specific</h2>\n<p>Instead of saying “I am going to save more this year,” or “I am going to save $5,000 this year,” try to specify exactly how you plan to do it. Start with something like: “I will take $100 from each paycheck and put it into a savings account.” By giving yourself a tangible – achievable &#8211; steps, you’ll be better able to track how well you are sticking to it.</p>\n<p>In addition, try to think about what it is that you are trying to accomplish. Why do you want to save an extra $100 each paycheck? Are you saving up for a car? Trying to pay off debt? Building up an emergency fund? When you add purpose to your goals, it makes it more compelling and easier to accomplish. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/060816/why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><em>Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</em></a>)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Stay Accountable</h2>\n<p>Know yourself: accept who you are and what that means. Are you someone who might let things build up then feel too overwhelmed to jump back on track? Think about sharing your goals with a friend or family member and set times to check in with them and go over your progress. If you want to go to the gym three days a week, think about getting a workout partner. If you want to save an extra $100 from each paycheck, see if there is a friend that has the same goal and you can do it together, comparing how it’s going throughout the journey.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, understand that this is a process. Some weeks will be better than others, but, if you can follow these three steps – set realistic goals, set specific goals, be accountable &#8211; hopefully you will be part of the 8% that gets it done this year.

The basic concept of value investing is to buy investment instruments when they are “on sale.” That means buying when everyone else is selling (and prices are down) and vice versa. A bargain-hunting value investor looks for what they consider to be healthy companies that are – for whatever reason &#8211; severely undervalued. A smart value investor buys low, then patiently waits for the “herd” to catch up. Unfortunately, most investors tend to do the exact opposite. We tend to chase trends and follow the herd. (For more, see: <em><u>Don’t Let Emotions Hinder Your Investing Goals</u></em>.)</p>\n<h2>Sounds Easy. So Why is it Hard?</h2>\n<p>A huge part of smart investing is psychological and this chart illustrates of one of the many psychological roadblocks we have as investors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/the_problem_with_buy/bsherman_chart_timing.png\" /></p>\n<p>We may <em>want</em> to buy low and sell high, but that goes against <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">our instincts and biases</a>. When a stock is falling, we dump it. When a stock is rising, we buy it. We sell a company when the price is falling because we are afraid of losing more money; we buy a stock when it is rising because we have a fear of missing out. To compound the problem, most investors are not experts at realizing when something high or low “enough.”</p>\n<p>At times, investing can feel like quicksand: the more you do and the harder you try, the more you sink. It requires effort to overcome the psychological biases that often prevent us from acting in our own best interest. It is human nature, for instance, to continue to make the same mistake over and over again, or to not let go of stocks when we should through either familiarity bias or disposition effect.</p>\n<h2>Goals and Risk Tolerance</h2>\n<p>So what can you do to avoid to avoid the pitfalls of trying to buy low and sell high?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Understand your goals and risk tolerance: </strong>before you get started investing, it is critically important to understand what it is you are trying to accomplish and how much risk you are comfortable taking. Once you have that figured out, you can create an investment plan that is appropriate for you and comfortable enough to keep you from impulse buying high and panic selling low.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid market timing: </strong>instead of trying to time investments perfectly and squeeze every last cent out of each one, focus on building a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds that give you the greatest chance to succeed over the long term.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage your resources</strong>: having a great financial plan and a diversified portfolio is irrelevant if you don’t follow through and stick to it. Becoming self-aware of the pitfalls is a great first step. Having a good financial advisor is a good step too. Just make sure that they are a fee-only fiduciary, so that they have <em>your</em> best interests in mind at all times.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think about it: if it were easy &#8211; if everyone bought low and sold high &#8211; there would be <em>no</em> high or low because the market prices would be continually correcting. Bargains <em>do</em> exist and sometimes the wisest choice <em>is</em> to lock in earnings. The safest financial plan for the long run, however, is to understand your goals and risk tolerance, then work to create an investment plan that builds on gains over the long term, rather than continually outguess the market.</p>\n<p>(For more, see: <em><u>Which Investor Personality Best Describes You?</u></em>)</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/advisors/54337/brad-sherman/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

I know first hand: my mother was a public school teacher and a single mom. While some teachers may have other assets and savings they can draw on, a great number of teachers will rely on the retirement plans commonly used by teachers, known as 403(b) plans, as a source of income once they retire.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>This Is Money Teachers Will Need</h2>\n<p>In a recent series, The New York Times detailed many issues with the 403(b) plans so critical to a comfortable retirement for teachers.

And while public school teachers often are offered decent pensions, many of them do not work for the decades required to qualify for a full payout. And pension formulas are becoming less generous for newer recruits.”</p>\n<p>Unlike 401(k) plans that are overseen and regulated by federal law based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, many 403(b) plans fall outside of ERISA oversight and protection.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Who Can Teachers Trust?</h2>\n<p>Instead of having access to a financial advisor who is a <a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiduciary</a>, someone who exclusively &#8211; and always -must have the client’s best interests in mind, teachers are often presented with salespeople from insurance brokers who earn commissions for recommending certain products. As one teacher recounted in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-teachers-brokers-fees.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">part two</a> of the NYT series: “From the teacher’s standpoint, they really miss out getting quality advice,” said Mr. Bergeron, 27, who sold the plans for Axa Advisors’ retirement benefits group. “People who are in the schools pitching them and positioning themselves as retirement specialists are really there just to sell them one product.” (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/110816/investors-guide-new-fiduciary-rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An Investor&#8217;s Guide to the New Fiduciary Rule</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Fee-only fiduciary advisors are advisors who only recommend investments that are the best for their <em>clients</em>, not ones that reward themselves. Fiduciary financial advisors aren’t trying to hit a quota or working for sales commissions on the products they recommend to you. Fiduciaries are committed to providing the best advice to investors – like teachers &#8211; looking to build a strong foundation. These advisors grow <em>with</em> you, not at your expense by profiting off the products they recommend to you.</p>\n<p>Many of the millions of employees in this country have access to 401(k) plans through their employer that are approved and monitored by the employer in some way, ensuring at least some oversight of the plan itself. Unfortunately, public school teachers as well as some teachers working for nonprofits and religious institutions are easy prey for companies trying to sell high-cost products because their retirement plans often don’t have the same oversight. Given the loosely regulated industry, the insurance salespeople or “advisors” pitching to teachers can recommend investment products that best for their own pockets, not the plan owners’.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>The Costs and Confusion</h2>\n<p>While 401(k) plans are not perfect either, as <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">we have pointed out before</a>, the majority of them offer more traditional investment options, such as mutual funds or stocks and bonds, making it easier to understand how your money is invested. In contrast, 403(b) plans are often held inside annuities, which can be confusing even for the most intelligent individual investors. Discussing Axa Advisors, a broker that often tries to sell annuities, <em>The New York Times</em> writes: “The most popular version of the Equi-Vest annuity has a total annual cost that can range from 1.81 to 2.63%, according to an analysis from Morningstar. In contrast, large 401(k) plans usually charge an annual fee of less than half a percent of assets, according to a May report by BrightScope using 2013 data.”</p>\n<p>Even if teacher realizes that they are paying excessive costs for their retirement investments, they are often locked into these annuities and required to pay a penalty if they want to make changes. If a teacher wants to transfer their assets out of the Axa Equi-Vest annuity into their own IRA, for example, they would have to pay a 5% penalty on the portion of that withdrawal that had been contributed within the last six years.</p>\n<p>One of — if not the biggest — advantage of many retirement plans is tax deferral, which allows these accounts to grow and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">compound</a> over a long time horizon. That ability to grown and earn compound interest is obviously compromised when you are paying excessive fees year over year.</p>\n<p>Teachers are one of our most important assets and deserve to be rewarded for their years of dedication to our country’s children, and therefore our country’s future. All too frequently, however, teachers not given access to solid, low-cost and efficient long-term investment options in their retirement plans. Nor are they given access to a financial advisor they can turn to with questions, knowing that they can trust the answers they are given.</p>\n<p>We encourage teachers to spend some time finding out more about their 403(b) retirement fund managers. It’s vital to find out whether they are a fiduciary, how they make money (fee-based or fee-only), and how personalized their investment strategy is.  (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/111116/403b-plans-flaws-teachers-should-know/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

With a fully diversified asset allocation strategy, there will be parts of your portfolio that go up, as well as other parts that go down, during times of stress. That way you’ll be comfortable sticking to your investment strategy and plan through peaks and dips. Not only that, but you will have purchased those less volatile instruments before pundits start shouting and everyone starts panic-purchasing, driving the costs up.

Whether it’s career progress, a workout plan, or an investment portfolio, it’s exciting to see fast results. And it can be frustrating when progress doesn’t come quickly: when you’re not learning those guitar chords fast enough or your portfolio isn’t shooting ahead of the Dow.</p>\n<p>Achieving real progress and real gains usually takes time in spite of tantalizing offers to get rock-solid abs in seven days, learn to flip houses in two weeks, or a discover sure-fire stock that’s the next Apple.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Wanting to See Quick Results</h2>\n<p>It’s human nature to crave quick results but when it comes to investing, your emotions &#8211; or a desire for quick gratification &#8211; can get in your way of building a solid financial plan. (For more about Behavioral Finance, see: <em><a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051916/8-common-biases-impact-investment-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 Common Biases That Impact Investment Decisions</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/30/investing-is-a-fascinating-business.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> for The Motley Fool, columnist Morgan Housel made some excellent points about how we limit our chances of seeing real progress by letting our emotions get the best of us.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Frustration</h2>\n<p>“Most investing mistakes and frustrations come from trying to run a marathon in an hour,” Housel writes about the difference between short and long-term investing. “Companies earn profits, and over a long period of time those profits accrue to shareholders. If you leave it at that – and you should – investing is such a basic game that doesn’t require much action.” (For more, see <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/060816/why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>If we stuck to that game plan and utilized a long investment horizon to really take advantage of compound interest, the progress you would see would be impossible to ignore. Compound interest is a great way to look back and see the progress of your investments over a long time horizon. We <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summarize it like this</a>:</p>\n<p><em>Compound interest is often compared to a snowball. If a two-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny circumference. As it keeps rolling, its surface grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution. If you invest $1,000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2,158.93, in 20 years that will be $4,660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. All it takes is patience to turn $1,000 – the price of one ski weekend – into $21,724.52. </em></p>\n<p>A main problem many investors have is they fail to allow for this long time-horizon to play out. Housel&#8217;s next point builds on this when he says…</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Progress Happens Too Slowly to Notice</h2>\n<p>“Progress happens too slowly to notice; setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.” This ties into the idea of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">prospect theory</a> and Housel summarizes this concept well: “Pain hurts more than the same level of gain feels good.” This is similar to the concept of loss aversion where investors make emotional decisions that unfortunately lead to doing the exact opposite that one should do. Take 2008, for example, when the markets lost almost 40% in a short period of time. Those who made emotional decisions and exited the markets quickly not only locked in a significant loss but likely missed out on one of the biggest <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\">bull markets</a> in history as the market tripled over the next six years.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So much of this is human psychology. Having a dollar that stays a dollar doesn’t feel like you’re losing money. And losing a dollar often hurts more than gaining a dollar feels good. It’s like sports — losing a close game generally makes people feel lower than winning a close game makes you feel good. That’s what makes our job so interesting — working with people to park their psychology at the door, not just today, but forever. Not easy, but when done correctly you can really start seeing that elusive “progress” word come into play. (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/080116/why-playing-it-safe-could-hurt-your-retirement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Playing It Safe Could Hurt Your Retirement</a></em>.)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Avoiding Catastrophic Mistakes</h2>\n<p>“Most investing success boils down to avoiding catastrophic mistakes.” You don’t need to be the world&#8217;s greatest stock picker to benefit from investing. Far from it actually. As Housel puts it: “Few good decisions are needed to do well over time.” Instead, what we need to do is avoid making the catastrophic mistakes that typically come from making an emotional decision and not planning properly. Market corrections happen. They will happen again. Without proper planning, it is easy to fall victim to the pitfalls of prospect theory and end up making an emotional, short-term decision that can derail any progress that you have made.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To summarize, all of this boils down to a simple line of thinking. When it comes to investing, leave your emotions at the door. If you are uncomfortable with your investments, that is something you should take immediate action in. You may be invested in a portfolio that is too risky based on your goals, <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/embed/90260b609e67a973f2f0\">risk tolerance</a> and needs. You may just not fully understand how you are invested which makes you nervous. Worst of all, you may have no plan what so ever. Start by reevaluating your goals, short, mid and long term. Create a plan and road map to accomplish those goals, and then stick to it.

For example, before you stuck to a dining budget where you only ate out on weekends, but now you are doing so two times a week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/antoine-walker/\">We recently wrote about how a former NBA star filed for bankruptcy after earning more than $100 million on the court. </a>Read below on some tips to help you avoid some of these mistakes.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Why Lifestyle Creep Is a Problem</h2>\n<p>Living above your means is a recipe for financial trouble. We constantly preach that it’s not about how much you make, but how <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/savings/\">much you save</a>. By earning more money, you have the opportunity to save more. Take advantage of these opportunities by really thinking about what is a necessity vs. what is a luxury.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Read below on some tips to help you avoid some of these mistakes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Write down and revisit your goals</strong></li>\n<li>Maybe your goals have changed, maybe they haven&#8217;t. By revisiting them, remind yourself what is important to you and you can then make sure that is what you are spending your money on.</li>\n<li>One additional suggestion is to not make any purchases with the money you are receiving from your raise for the first month after receiving it. This gives you time to digest the news and will give you the ability to make more rational purchase decisions. If you still want to buy it after a month, then go for it.</li>\n<li><strong>Create and update your budget</strong></li>\n<li>If you don’t already have a budget, now is the perfect time to create one. If your boss gives you a $10,000 raise, that comes out to about $830 per month before taxes. With your goals in mind from tip No. 1, lay out all of your expenses and determine where the money should go each month. By having a set schedule, you reduce the urge to make impulse purchases because you see a large number in your checking account.

There are numerous banks that we recommend to our clients that give you the ability to create multiple savings accounts to bucket your savings based on your goals. Create accounts for each of your goals and set up automatic transfers to these accounts from each paycheck you receive.</li>\n<li>In addition to your emergency fund account and other savings goals, make sure to give yourself a fun account that can be used to spend on celebrations such as getting a raise!</li>\n<li><strong>Increase or max out your retirement contribution</strong></li>\n<li>As part of your budget, look at how much you are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/playing-safe-hurt-retirement/\">contributing to your retirement account</a> each month. If you have the opportunity to increase your contribution, that is a great option to consider. If you have an employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">401(k)</a>, not only are you saving more for retirement, but you are also lowering your taxable income that just increased because of your raise. You may even qualify for an employer match, which makes these savings even greater!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After working so hard to get to where you are now, you should give yourself a chance to enjoy that success and celebrate. The important part is keeping an eye on the big picture and not letting your short-term emotions get in the way of achieving your true financial goals. By creating a plan that is realistic and one that you feel you can stick to, you dramatically increase your chances of success.

It is impossible to know how much you need to trim (or have room to grow) without first taking stock of what’s coming in and what’s going out.

FINRA recently released the results of its 2015 <a href=\"http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/downloads/NFCS_2015_Report_Natl_Findings.pdf\">survey</a>, which includes the fact that only 37% of those who took the survey could answer four of the five questions on a basic financial literacy quiz. Four out of five is FINRA’s baseline for high financial literacy. Back in 2009, 42% of the respondents were considered to meet this level of financial literacy. (If you’re curious, you can take the quiz <a href=\"http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/quiz.php\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>We’ve previously written about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">biases</a> in financial habits and the desolate state of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\">personal finance education</a> in high school and college, and this study re-confirms our suspicions. Way less than half of the American population has a sufficient understanding of the basic ideas necessary for successful saving and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-test-drive/\">financial planning</a>! That is nearing crisis levels.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake–an ignorance of personal finance, while probably unintentional, has serious consequences. Just over half of respondents said they are worried about running out of money in retirement, only one in five are willing to take risks when investing, and 57% say they set long-term financial goals. But, when taken together with those statistics, the most concerning part is that 76% have a high self-assessment of their financial literacy.</p>\n<p>As finance writer Jeff Sommer points out in his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/your-money/what-you-think-you-know-about-money-but-dont-can-hurt-you.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent column</a>, this means that Americans don’t know very much about personal finance and saving, but think they do. The positive self-perception is also the only figure to have significantly increased since 2009.</p>\n<p>Improving financial conditions can create a false sense of security for many savers who think their current status makes them recession-proof. This is a huge reason why I decided to start my own firm. I recognized the alarming lack of awareness about saving, spending and the markets, and noted many common bad habits that can lead to trouble in an economic downturn.

Traditional wealth management practices often have <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">high account minimums</a> that make their financial advice unreachable for most people. Moreover, even if you can open an account with a wealth manager, they may not be required by law to act in only <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/fiduciary-planner.asp\">your best interest</a>, which can lead to inefficient investments for you that pay them commissions.</p>\n<p>The reality is that many people are scared by the thought of investing. Since many Americans are mostly in the dark, they may not know where to go or how to start. That’s why it’s important to use online resources and educate yourself on all aspects of personal finance.

Full-time offers will be tendered, sighs of relief exhaled and paychecks cashed. Interns who receive offers will be bright-eyed with lofty visions of moonshot careers at their new place of employment. As these interns begin to accept the end of college and pivot towards the start of the rest of their lives, we strongly encourage them to start considering a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\">long-term financial plan.</a></p>\n<p>Sure, it is tempting to put most of your extra cash earned this summer in your checking account for drinks, trips to visit friends or to buy yourself something nice. The decidedly less glamorous option is to put a chunk of that cash into a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp\">Roth</a> or <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp\">Traditional individual retirement account</a> (IRA). But, almost certainly, that is the option for which your future self would pat you on the back. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\"><em>The Conflicts of Interest Around 401(k) Plans.</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Early Planning Is a Tough Sell</h2>\n<p>We know this is a tough sell for most college students. Salaries and long-term financial security aren&#8217;t big concerns for today’s generation as it has been before. Even on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wallstreet.asp\">Wall Street</a>, where compensation is high, interns seek other qualities in a company. For example, interns at investment bank Jefferies <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-interns-write-monthly-memo-000000295.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said they valued </a>relatable leadership, a family atmosphere and inclusion. So we get that saving for retirement may not be where your mind is at—especially if you received an offer and want to celebrate. (Which, by all means, you should.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>We aren’t here to suggest you start living a life of austerity now that college is almost over. But you must consider that right now is the best time in your life to put a bit of money away for retirement. The <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">power of compound interest</a> means that the earlier you start saving, the greater your returns will be. It doesn’t matter how small the amount—money invested in the stock market can grow exponentially over time because it compounds year over year.</p>\n<p>In our experience, many college-aged people <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">don’t know where to start</a>, even if they are interested in opening an IRA. The choice between, for example, a Roth or Traditional IRA can be opaque and intimidating. And then, once an account has been opened, where do you actually invest the money? How can it be monitored? (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\"><em>6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>To pile on top of that, as you graduate and find a new pad, start work and are presented with options for employer-sponsored retirement plans, you might be forced to consider trade-offs. Should you work on paying off your student loans or invest that money into growing your retirement account? Or, you might ask yourself, why invest at all when I can just keep my earnings in cash?</p>\n<p>All of this “adulting” can be overwhelming, and unfortunately often leads to poor financial decisions. (For some guidance, we highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Oliver’s take on saving and financial advice</a>.) But one thing you can be confident of is that starting to save now has almost no downside. If you aren’t totally sure of your ability to open an account and invest on your own, follow John Oliver’s advice and contact a low-cost, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">fiduciary financial advisor</a> who can work with you to grow your investment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that putting a chunk of your income towards retirement at such a young age isn’t sexy. But it has enormous benefit and will set you on a path of financial wellness. It’s the right thing to do.

He has made so many newsworthy remarks that it is hard to keep up. One day last week was <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-gop-trump-go-unraveling-break-glass-mode-n622116\">particularly</a> impressive as he made over 10 news-making assertions in under 24 hours. These included initially refusing to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan, doubling down on his feud with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan and predicting that the election will be rigged. (For more, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">The Conflicts of Interest Around 401(k)s.</a>)</p>\n<p>Whether you support him or not, simply finding the time in the day to make all those remarks (and more) is impressive. But there was one opinion in particular that caught our eye, via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/760475701317427200\">CBS’s Sopan Deb.</a> Trump made the below statements during an interview with FOX Business Network&#8217;s Stuart Varney:</p>\n<p><strong>Varney:</strong> For the the small investor, the average guy, right now, would you say, yes, put your 401(k) money into stocks?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong> No, I don’t like a lot of things that I see. I don’t like a lot of the signs that I’m seeing. I don’t like what’s happening with immigration policies. I don’t like the fact that we’re moving tremendous numbers of people from Syria are coming into this country and we don’t even know it. Thousands of people, thousands and thousands of people. There’s so many things that I just don’t like what I’m seeing. I don’t like what I’m seeing at all. Look, interest rates are artificially low. If interest rates ever seek a natural level, which obviously would be much higher than they are right now, you have some very scary scenarios out there. The only reason the stock market is where it is—is because you get free money.</p>\n<h3>Trump&#8217;s Approach</h3>\n<p>Even if you are his number one fan, please don’t hire Donald Trump to manage your 401(k). First of all, setting aside the economic truth of what Trump is saying and whether his fears will ultimately influence the market as much as he thinks, every factor that he mentions in his response is short-term. As Trump is 70 years old, focusing on what’s coming immediately down the line is understandable. But most investors have longer to go until retirement and therefore need to be invested in the stock market’s long-term gains, particularly those investors without Trump’s level of wealth. (For more, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/playing-safe-hurt-retirement/\">Why Playing It Safe Could Hurt Your Retirement.</a>)</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-02/donald-trump-your-401-k-adviser\">Bloomberg points out</a>, Trump’s strategy basically amounts to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\">timing the market</a>. We believe that in the long run, due to the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">efficient market hypothesis</a>, you can’t beat the returns of the market through individual stock selection and market timing. Therefore, the safest thing to do is to stick with the market, while of course monitoring constantly and rebalancing.</p>\n<p>Trump’s approach could be a recipe for long-term disaster. Fidelity Investments has compared how investors who pulled out of the market near its bottom in 2008-09 fared versus those who stayed. Those investors who stuck with the market ended 2015 $82,000 richer than those who withdrew, on average. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\">Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</a>)</p>\n<p>So even if Trump is completely correct, it is not a good strategy for a long-term retirement saver, which is the demographic he was asked about. If Donald Trump applied his advice to your 401(k), you’d probably do worse than if you ignored him, even in the case of a market correction.</p>\n<p>Asked about alternatives to the stock market, Trump would likely point to real estate (<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/donald-trump-and-the-benefit-of-financial-foresight/\">we wrote about that here</a>), which is where most of his dealings have been. The answer is somewhere in between a diversified portfolio with investments in real estate (if you can afford it), but also stocks, bonds, the money market, etc. If a market correction really is coming as Trump predicts, then the best hedge against it isn’t to pull all your money out of equities. Rather, for most savers, we think the best protections are a long-term financial plan and a diversified portfolio, both of which account for short-term market volatility.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/080916/donald-trump-takes-stand-401k-investments/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

In answering what was the best way to invest money unneeded for at least 10 years, real estate (25%) and cash (23%) took the top spots, followed by the stock market and gold (16% each) in a tie for third. This comes on the heels of Bank of America finding that <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/19/investor-cash-levels-highest-in-15-years-according-to-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-survey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash levels in portfolios are at their highest since November 2001</a>.</p>\n<p>In a time of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/\">volatility</a> in the market, many Americans, particularly those who are young and/or without a huge amount of money to invest, are hesitant. They prefer the certainty of a house or even cash under the mattress to the unpredictability and seeming inaccessibility of the public markets. On the surface, this <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fear-keeps-millennials-investing-sidelines/\">seems like the safer option</a>, and we understand why many people feel this way. Loss aversion is countered by having a tangible stack of cash that will always be there.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s wrong and can be dangerous in the long term.</p>\n<p>What many cash-focused savers don’t realize is that because of <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a>, the value of cash fluctuates over time—just like a stock. As Alex Gurevich, CIO of HonTE Investments, points out, that means that <a href=\"http://alexgurevich.tumblr.com/post/147567467957/journey-of-cash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash is subject to bubbles</a> similar to tech in 2000 or the mortgage crisis. Moreover, saving only cash eliminates access to the market’s long-term returns; $10,000 invested in the <a href=\"http://alexgurevich.tumblr.com/post/147567467957/journey-of-cash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&amp;P 500</a> in 1980 <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">would yield</a> $166,600 at year-end 2015, adjusted for inflation. Even with the ups and downs, in the long run the stock market remains the best place to invest for retirement. (For related reading, see: <em>Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy</em>)</p>\n<p>Saving cash is still important for short-term emergency funds. But if simply stockpiling cash is your long-term plan for retirement, you probably have no shot unless you’re very wealthy.</p>\n<p>Many people may avoid the stock market out of a fear of the bad days when the market tumbles. Some people panic when the market dips (for example, in the event of a major world <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/instituting-investing-rules-lessons-from-the-brexit/\">event like Brexit</a>) and sell most or even all of their stock. Besides the fallacy of panic-selling at play here (you’d be selling low rather than buying low and selling high), by withdrawing from the stock market you miss out on the good days as the price of shielding yourself from the bad. Reporter Spencer Jakab <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-youre-a-lousy-investor-and-dont-even-know-it-1468266957\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">points out</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journa</em>l that a couple good days a year produce the entire year’s returns, on average. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\"><em>Behavioral Finance: 8 Common Investor Biases That Impact Investment Decisions</em></a>)</p>\n<p>“Investors sit out on some really good days by trying to avoid bad ones,” Jakab writes. “Nearly all of those happen around scary episodes such as October 1929, October 1987 and in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Pretend, for example, that you took your money out of the market following the choppiest episodes over the last 20 years and wound up missing the epic rebounds that made up the 40 best days. You actually would lose money.”</p>\n<p>The stock market can be threatening and, sometimes, punishing. But the solution isn’t total withdrawal; on the contrary, find an advisor you trust and create a plan that makes you more comfortable about investing. As Ben Carlson <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2016/06/you-have-to-invest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes</a>, “The alternative for stepping out into the unknown is the known of never building your wealth.”</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/080116/why-playing-it-safe-could-hurt-your-retirement/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Because your investment returns are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">compounded</a>, the earlier you start investing the more — and longer — will the returns add up, ultimately leaving you with more money in the bank.</p>\n<p>So what are millennials waiting for? Many of the concerns holding them back from the market boil down to a lack of information about investing. Some of the most common fears are:</p>\n<h3>‘I have no idea where to start’</h3>\n<p>Many potential young investors have <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no idea where to start</a> even if they wanted to buy just one stock. And then they don’t know how to choose which stock or fund to invest in. Since most people don’t get personal finance education as part of their schooling, investing can seem enormously daunting and precarious.</p>\n<p>A little online research can demystify many of the basic investing concepts, such as how compounded interest works, how patience can be beneficial, and how to not overreact to temporary dips in the market. Working with a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-test-drive/\">financial advisor to develop a plan</a> and ease into an investing strategy also can help reduce your stress and anxiety about entering the stock market.</p>\n<h3>‘I haven’t even paid off my loans — I can’t start saving’</h3>\n<p>Concern about debt, particularly student loans, is understandable and widespread among millennials. Student loan borrowers have an <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/employer-benefit-student-loans/\">average debt of almost $30,000</a> for undergraduate loans. The question of whether to pay off student loan debt more aggressively or use the extra money to start saving is a tough one because people don’t have the same financial situations. Your debt, cash flow and spending circumstances are unique and will require a plan that’s customized to you.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, however, that your years as a young professional are your prime saving period. If you can stomach not using all your extra money to pay off loans, you could reap the long-term benefit of investing early. Paying down a high-interest loan is a priority. But if the interest is low enough, consider creating a financial plan that allots some of your savings to an IRA or 401(k). Over time, the return on that investment, with the help of compounded interest, can make the trade-off worthwhile.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have high-interest loans, creating a long-term, comprehensive financial plan that includes saving and investing is the best way of making sure you’ll have the funds you’ll need in the future, whether it’s to pay down debt, buy or rent a house, or make any other important expenditure. If you live on a tight budget, controlling and mapping out your spending becomes even more important.</p>\n<h3>‘I don’t trust, or can’t afford, financial advisors’</h3>\n<p>Many advisors require high asset minimums that may be well out of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\">reach for young investors</a>. And even then, the advisor could put your money in inefficient investment products that could generate commissions and other hidden fees for the advisor and inflate your investing costs.</p>\n<p>Many advisors are not legally obligated to act only in their clients’ best interest; they merely have to suggest “suitable” investments. In many cases this means investments for which they are paid a commission. But those who uphold the fiduciary standard are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\">required to put their clients’ interests first</a>. And fee-only advisors are paid solely for the advice they give you, and not through commissions on the products they recommend.</p>\n<p>Millennials are right to be wary of the industry, but there are advisors who won’t put their profit goals ahead of yours. Look for a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">fee-only fiduciary advisor</a>. You may also want to work initially with a fiduciary advisor who charges by the hour if advisors with asset-management minimums are out of reach.</p>\n<p>You need a financial plan that’s customized for your own situation and goals. But that doesn’t mean you can afford a delayed start. The sooner you map out a financial plan and start saving and investing, the bigger the payoff will be down the road.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/millennials-fear-investing/\">Nerdwallet.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

More specifically, the 2,500 funds surveyed were less likely to eliminate underperforming funds that were their own rather than another provider’s fund. This can be very costly to retirement savers. Clemens Sialm, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the study’s authors, explained that the bottom 10% of funds continued to underperform by about 4% if kept on the menu of funds available to investors.</p>\n<p>With all of the attention lately focused on reducing these <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">conflicts of interest</a> where financial managers invest your money in their own funds (among individual financial advisors rather than institutional), it is surprising to see the bias getting coverage on an institutional level. As of June 2015, $4.7 trillion were invested in 401(k) accounts, plus another $2.1 trillion in non-401(k) defined-contribution plans. As John Oliver<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\"> recently detailed</a>, these conflicts of interest can cost millions over the course of a single retirement plan’s life. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/antoine-walker/\">Financial Failings of NBA Legend Antoine Walker</a>.)</p>\n<h3>Why the Conflicts Exist</h3>\n<p>The reason for the existence of these conflicts of interest is simple. Managers are prioritizing the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">profits of their institution</a> over the success of the retirement plans they oversee. And there is no question that it is a raw deal for the investor. We’ve previously covered how many actively managed funds don’t even beat the market in the first place, and this study confirms that failing funds aren’t even taken off the menu of options. Imagine if your local restaurant kept undercooking their chicken and everyone was getting sick, but they refused to change the recipe.<br />\nMany employees at big asset management firms are now <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2016/07/06/how-dare-you-make-us-eat-our-own-cooking/\">suing their own companies</a> to liberate their own retirement plans from management. These people know it’s a scam, and God forbid that their own money gets caught up in it, but by and large they are OK with selling you inefficient funds. (For related reading, see: 6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor and Do You Need to Change Your Financial Advisor?)</p>\n<p>These current events—and the study—indicate that conflicts of interest are pervasive in all aspects of the retirement planning industry, whether it’s a 401(k) through your employer or via traditional financial advisors. Dealing with this reality requires vigilance on your part. To return to the analogy of the undercooked chicken, it would be an easy case to deal with since everyone could tell that the chicken was making them sick. But what allows traditional asset companies to get away with conflicts of interest is that many people are simply too busy to monitor their accounts—that is, to find out if they are sick or not. If the undercooked chicken gave you an illness that was hard to detect, it would be much easier for the restaurant to get away with it.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the tide is beginning to turn, and you can impact change, even with your 401(k). You should become an advocate for your own money. Contact your HR department and ask to see the performance of the menu of funds. See <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\">who’s managing it</a>, how the menu has changed and evaluate the extent of conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, independent, conflict-free advice and management is the best cure for the industry’s problem.

A big man who also shot the three, Walker was notorious for his hilariously erratic shot selection and, later in his career, an aversion to running that led to lazy play.</p>\n<p>The quality of financial advice Walker received throughout his career was evidently very close to the quality of his shot attempts, as he <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/24/investing/antoine-walker-nba-bankruptcy/\">filed for bankruptcy</a> in 2010, two years after he retired from the game. In a recent column in the <a href=\"http://www.theplayerstribune.com/2016-6-28-antoine-walker-nba-letter-to-my-younger-self/\">Players’ Tribune</a>, Walker writes a letter to his younger self detailing what went wrong and what he could have done better.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, there are a few money management lessons that anyone—NBA star or not—can apply. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\">Do You Need to Change Your Financial Advisor</a>?)</p>\n<p><strong>Actively Screen Advisors<br />\n</strong>Screen advisors before you hire them, and after you do, make sure you know where your money is going. Walker frames his letter with the importance and difficulty of saying “no,” whether to friends asking for money or, most crucially, a friend of a friend who asked for money to start a real estate venture.</p>\n<p>The advisor, who Walker met at a dinner with NBA colleagues, started Walker Ventures with bank loans guaranteed by Walker’s personal portfolio, an incredibly risky move. Walker let the advisor have complete control of managing the properties since he was playing basketball nine months of the year. Ultimately, Walker Ventures was forced to close after the housing crash with $20 million of debt. The advisor went to jail, and Walker was forced to file for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>There were a couple ways this could have been prevented. First, Walker didn’t do much due diligence before making the deal. He could have run it by another advisor, who probably would have told him it was structured as an extremely risky venture. Second, because of his schedule, Walker did not adequately check up on the investments.</p>\n<p>Many people, particularly young investors, share Walker’s desire to make some money outside of their main job, especially to save for retirement. Finding a financial advisor who is trustworthy, and right for your unique needs, is very important. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor.</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>The Upside of Having Someone Say No<br />\n</strong>Walker’s trouble with the real estate venture was compounded by his reckless spending. While he confesses that he spent lavishly on himself, including a $350,000 Maybach car, it appears that what took the biggest bite out of Walker’s wallet was his spending on family and friends. &#8220;I gave them whatever they wanted and spoiled them. You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Walker said in a CNN/Money interview. &#8220;It ended up being an open ATM throughout my career.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While most of us don’t take our friends to a Gucci store and let them buy whatever they want—as Walker has said he did—spending without at least an idea of what is manageable is a problem many people encounter. For <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\">young professionals in particular</a>, overspending can seriously hinder retirement saving.</p>\n<p>A good financial advisor will do more than simply invest your money. They will incorporate periodic spending goals, major expenditures like vacations, and life events like a new home or wedding into your comprehensive financial plan. Sometimes, this could mean advising against a big purchase for the sake of a long-term goal.</p>\n<p>Obviously, we don’t all have $110 million to blow like Antoine Walker. But lackadaisical spending control and being too busy to check on our investments or advisors are traps anyone could fall into. Ensuring that your money is in the right hands is a universally important objective.

According to the article, 81% of advisors surveyed said they used or recommended ETFs to their clients in 2015. We have been advocating ETFs as a secure, flexible investment for our clients since the days when they weren’t as popular.</p>\n<p>Here’s a look at some ETF basics. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><em>Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>What Are ETFs?</h2>\n<p>An ETF combines features of stocks and mutual funds. Like a mutual fund, it is composed of a group of stocks, giving investors access to a diverse array of securities with only one transaction, an investment in the fund. And like stocks, an ETF can be bought or sold on the open market at market-determined prices. ETFs are usually used to track specific indexes of the securities market as a whole or of specific sectors. The first ETF in 1993 was created to track and match the performance of the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp?ad=dirN&amp;qo=investopediaSiteSearch&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=40186\">S&amp;P 500 index</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Why Do We Use Them?</h2>\n<p>ETFs have a number of advantages for investors who are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\">saving for retirement</a>. These include:</p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> While the holdings of a regular mutual fund are only reported every quarter or year, ETFs report their holdings every day since they are traded and the holdings are a reflection of an index. Knowing exactly which positions you are invested in can help with fine-tuning your portfolio according to your <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/embed/90260b609e67a973f2f0\">risk tolerance</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower costs:</strong> The passive nature of ETFs allows them to have significantly lower costs than a mutual fund. In short, actively managed funds, as the name implies, execute a far greater number of trades than passive funds like ETFs, which are generally not overseen by a fund manager on a daily basis. As a result, ETFs usually incur much lower costs than actively managed funds. (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\">Don’t Expect to Win With Actively Managed Funds</a>.</em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Mutual funds, whether active or passive, can only be sold at the end of the trading day. On the other hand, ETFs are traded throughout the day and their price continually updated.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax efficiency:</strong> There are several factors underlying the structure and operations of ETFs that make them more efficient than a lot of mutual funds. To buy shares of a mutual fund, you must exchange cash for shares directly with the fund. There is no middleman; therefore, when the fund realizes capital gains on an investment, those gains are passed through to the individual investors and you must pay tax on it. When purchasing shares of an ETF, the shares in the ETF are purchased through a middleman called an Authorized Participant, not the fund itself. (The AP purchases shares from the fund when they are originally issued.) This degree of removal from the fund and the capital gains it realizes can help you avoid significant taxes on long-term capital gains. Additionally, since ETFs don’t make as many trades as actively-managed funds, there are fewer chances for an event that could generate capital gains, which will be taxed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how do they fit with our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">investment strategy</a>? We think that your best chance at building wealth through the markets for retirement is to work with a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/?ad=dirN&amp;qo=investopediaSiteSearch&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=40186\">fiduciary advisor</a> to utilize a long-term approach that emphasizes diversification, tax efficiency, risk management and cost effectiveness. We believe in the efficient market hypothesis, which dictates that in the long run, it is nearly impossible to beat the returns of the market by picking individual stocks and market timing. Therefore, an ETF is generally a stable—but flexible—tool for long-term growth if used properly.

That said, there is a lot to be learned from what’s already happened. We think that in the aftermath of Brexit, you need investing rules that you stick to hard and fast.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The market crash post-Brexit panicked a lot of investors. Of course, investors and advisors should have <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basic philosophies</a> that they stick to, even in times of market crashes, such as not following the herd and selling off when a stock is lowest. (You can read more about the detriments of panic selling <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.) But it may be beneficial to establish some firmer rules for exactly what qualities the investments you make will have.</p>\n<p>For example, consider <a href=\"https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/June-2016-10-Questions.aspx?platform=hootsuite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the following</a> from Kevin O’Leary, Shark Tank judge and O’Shares chairman: “Imagine if you could create the perfect portfolio manager that had no style drift, that never, ever got emotionally involved in a stock, that only used the most hardcore rules on balance sheet testing, and never, ever strayed from that. That’s what rule-based investing is. It takes out one of the challenges I’ve found as an investor over the decades.”</p>\n<p>In other words, you have to eliminate emotion from your investing. As a retirement saver, this can be incredibly difficult after big market swings, whether up or down. We’ve <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previously explained why active management doesn’t win</a> and one of the benefits of passive investment management is that since it takes a long-term view, it reduces the role of emotion in investment decisions. Creating investing rules can be a good extension of this strategy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/070616/instituting-investing-rules-lessons-brexit/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Trust issues.” West wonders whether those around him are there because they really have his best interests at heart, or if they only care about him for his money.</p>\n<p>Given recent developments in the financial advisory industry, many Millennials might be wondering the same thing about their financial advisor. The Department of Labor (DOL) will soon be enacting a new rule that requires all financial advisors handling a retirement account to abide by a fiduciary standard, which means always acting in the best interests of the client and not the advisor’s or corporation’s profits. It might be surprising, but that is currently not always the case. If your advisor is not a fiduciary, he or she may not be obligated to act only in your best interest. You can read more about the new rule and our take on the fiduciary obligation <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Opponents of the rule, unsurprisingly the financial services industry’s lobbyists, who largely oppose the rule, point to a study saying that <a href=\"http://m.wealthmanagement.com/industry/report-dol-rule-may-force-advisors-abandon-small-investors?NL=WM-27&amp;Issue=WM-27_20160618_WM-27_55&amp;sfvc4enews=42&amp;cl=article_1_2&amp;utm_rid=CPG09000003982919&amp;utm_campaign=6329&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;elq2=8e29b8ece7c644bfa8ff682effdaff1b\">it will decrease access</a> to financial advice for small investors since advisors “cannot figure out how to make money when working with them.” Without the fiduciary obligation, how do advisors currently profit from younger investors? Forbes recently published <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganstanley/2016/06/06/the-millennials-guide-to-a-sweet-retirement/?sr_source=lift_facebook&amp;nowelcome&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=morganstanley#624a74135837\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an article</a> by the Morgan Stanley team where advisor T. Gregory Naples says that with Millennial clients he,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“starts them out in managed mutual funds until they reach $50,000. After that, he often switches them to more transparent and lower-cost stock and bond funds managed by institutional money managers.”</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Breaking it Down</h2>\n<p>This is a huge admission. Let’s break down exactly what Naples is saying. Crucially, Naples admits that, until you hit $50,000 <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp?o=40186&amp;l=dir&amp;qsrc=1&amp;qo=serpSearchTopBox&amp;ap=investopedia.com\">assets under management</a> (AUM), he invests your money in more expensive, less efficient funds. Many of these “actively managed” funds, which try to beat the market’s returns, have higher costs because of labor and number of trades they execute. After this period, once your AUM gets to a point where Naples can more easily make money off of you through fees, he puts your money into more efficient places it should have been all along.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Later on, he mentions examples illustrating the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">compound interest</a>, but neglects to mention that the unnecessary fees you are incurring from the inefficient funds he has invested your money into will eat away at the returns you get from the compound interest. This illustrates the folly of the argument that the fiduciary rule will drive young investors away. Young investors who are just starting out are, in fact, much better off being driven away from advisors with non-fiduciary practices like Naples. Entrusting your money to a non-fiduciary, traditional financial advisor as a young, new investor is like intentionally hitchhiking on a road known for having murderous truck drivers when there’s a much safer road nearby. (Read more about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">6 Questions to Ask A Financial Advisor</a>)</p>\n<p>People naturally gravitate towards big firms with name recognition. But as the Naples quote demonstrates, these large, non-fiduciary firms may not always be the best option, particularly for young investors. What the back-and-forth over the DOL rule reveals is that non-fiduciary advisors often don’t even really want your money. Most seek accounts with higher balances. So <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">why go where your money is not wanted?</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/062916/do-you-need-change-your-financial-advisor/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Bad habits — whether it’s biting our nails, overeating, smoking or something else — create roadblocks on the path to becoming our best selves.</p>\n<p>And it’s no different when it comes to our finances. Bad money habits can have damaging, long-term consequences for our financial security. But developing healthy financial habits can do wonders for helping us achieve our long-term goals like <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">saving enough for retirement</a> or paying for a child’s college education.</p>\n<p>The earlier you develop healthy financial habits, the better your chances of successfully meeting your goals. Here are four financial habits you should start working on today:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Separate spending on ‘needs’ and ‘wants’</strong></h3>\n<p>This is the first step in developing healthy habits. You need to understand where your money is going and then figure out where you need to allocate it to make the best use of it.</p>\n<p>Sticking to a spending plan and avoiding impulse buying is crucial for building a healthy savings plan. Create a simple budget that shows you how much money you are bringing in and helps you understand your monthly spending. Add up all of your expenses that you would consider a need — this includes your monthly savings amount, rent, car payment, cable and internet bill, food, etc. (By including your savings amount in your need category, you create an automatic savings plan for yourself — more on that below.) Subtract that total from your income, and what is left over is your free <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">cash flow</a>.</p>\n<p>The remaining money is the amount you have at your disposal for your “want” expenses. At the very least, make sure you are not spending more than that. At the end of the month, if you still have money left over, stick it in your savings or investment account. This removes the temptation to spend it and lets you start the next month fresh again. If you consistently have money left over, increase your savings amount.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Set up automatic savings</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating a consistent savings mechanism will ensure you are saving a minimum amount each month or paycheck, making progress toward your longer-term goals. Whether you are saving into an investment account or your bank savings account, set up an automatic contribution from each of your paychecks so that the money is “out of sight, out of mind” and you won’t be tempted to spend it.</p>\n<p>Why is this so important? Without having an automatic savings plan, you could be saving $500 one month and then $0 the next. Although this is better than not saving at all, it is not a good practice to adopt. And remember, you can start small. Even if it’s $100 a month, saving consistently will pay off immensely down the road.<em> </em></p>\n<h3><strong>3. Participate in your employer-sponsored retirement plan</strong></h3>\n<p>Saving for retirement is one of the most important financial habits you can build for yourself. The power of tax-deferred investment growth over your entire career can really add up. Another benefit with 401(k)s and other retirement plans is that the money you contribute is pretax, which effectively lowers your taxable income, reducing your tax liability today.</p>\n<p>If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k) based on your contribution level, it’s especially important to contribute enough to take advantage of this benefit. The employer is basically offering you free money that you would be turning down. For instance, an employer may offer a retirement savings plan to which you can contribute up to 5% of your salary and it will match up to 3% of that. If you don’t contribute at least 3%, you are in effect saying no to a 3% raise.</p>\n<p>If your employer does not offer a retirement savings plan, look into opening a self-directed retirement account such as an IRA so you can benefit from tax-advantaged retirement saving.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Start investing now</strong></h3>\n<p>Time is the greatest advantage investors have when it comes to saving and investing early and consistently. With the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">compound interest</a>, even small amounts can really add up over the years. With compound interest, your interest amount is added to the principal, increasing the amount of interest you earn, even if the rate of return does not change. To take advantage of compound interest, the earlier you start saving, the better.</p>\n<p>If you can boost your savings rate, you’ll be even better off in the event of a long period of low investment returns, according to Michael Batnick, director of research for investment firm Ritholtz Wealth Management. “<a href=\"http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2016/05/19/how-to-stack-the-odds-in-your-favor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Saving more money can offset lower returns </a>because you’re compounding on top of compounding,” Batnick writes. He points to a comparison of two portfolios over a 20-year period, both starting with contributions of $5,000 a year. The portfolio earning an average of 4% annually, with contributions increased by 10% each year, will have $100,000 more in it compared with a portfolio earning 6% a year, with contributions raised by only 5% ($393,153 vs. $293,534).</p>\n<h3>Prioritize your goals</h3>\n<p>If you already have these good financial habits, that’s great. If not, the best time to start developing them is now. Everyone will have their own goals and needs, and, unfortunately, not all of those can be satisfied at the same time. You’ll have to prioritize your goals, but once you do, you can start building healthy habits that will allow you to reach them. Separating your needs from your wants, saving early and often, taking advantage of tax-favored retirement savings plans, and investing now can help you build a solid financial foundation and get you where you want to go.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/4-healthy-financial-habits-develop-now-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NerdWallet.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

In light of a new Department of Labor rule requiring all financial advisors to act as fiduciaries for retirement accounts, </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in which we strongly believe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Oliver skewered the opaque tendencies of brokers and traditional financial advisors. He urges viewers to bring their business to a transparent fiduciary who has your best interest at heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oliver’s segment serves an important purpose — many regular people who trust a traditional financial advisor with their money, or millennials who are just now beginning to think about retirement planning, simply don’t know the many ways the advisor could be robbing them of their hard-earned money. While not everyone is as clueless as the woman whom Oliver ridicules for asking CNBC host Suze Orman whether she should spend $4,000 to get an elf-spotting certification in Iceland, the many ways traditional financial advisors hurt their clients are often hidden unless the client does the digging themselves. With that in mind, here are four major takeaways from Oliver’s monologue.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>1. Many financial advisors may not have your best interest at heart — but you can find one who does.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Oliver notes, “financial advisor” is a vague term. Even so, many traditional financial advisors  are not fiduciaries, and instead operate on commission. (<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">An advisor who is a fiduciary</a> must always act in the best interests of you, the client.) This means they can execute trades and strategies that line their own pockets with little regard for your financial well-being. We believe that this is unacceptable; as a result, we operate as a fee-only fiduciary that does not receive any sort of commission. While some advisors make money by endorsing a particular investment or product to their clients, we are paid only by our clients.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. The “active management” of many funds and advisors can destroy your capital.</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we’ve previously detailed </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in this blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you shouldn&#8217;t expect to win with actively managed funds. Not only do these funds fail to outperform the market, but in doing so they also accrue massive fees due to the large amount of trades they are making. While compound interest grows your investment over time, interest isn’t the only thing that compounds — fees do as well. Oliver cites a study in which an index of stocks, selected by a cat throwing a ball at them, outperformed an actively managed fund overseen by experts. The cat earned returns of 7%, while the pros garnered only 3.5%. Oliver summarizes the situation succinctly: “If you stick around doing nothing while everyone else around you [messes] up, you’re going to win big.” At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe sticking with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">investments that focus on low cost and tax efficiency</a> is the best way to save for the long term. ETFs are an investment vehicle that we utilize to accomplish this goal. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>3. It doesn’t have to be this complicated, and it might be getting simpler.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are easy steps you can take. Start saving now — it’s never too early. When screening financial advisors, ask if they are fiduciaries. With your money in the hands of a fiduciary who puts your best interest first, you can be confident in your advisor’s motivations. </span></p>\n<p>Feel like the little guy/girl who can&#8217;t get the time of day from your &#8220;financial advisor&#8221;? Read our post &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">Why Go Where Your Money&#8217;s Not Wanted?</a></p>\n<h3><strong>4. These principles aren’t abstract — they have real consequences for real people, like you.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To demonstrate all of this, Oliver examined the 401k his own employees at HBO were using through their provider. The retirement fund charged 1.69% fees, and their broker refused to offer low-cost, low-fee plans. The advisor even messed up the calculations on the compounding interest, making his original math off by over $10,000,000. These are not the actions of someone who values his/her clients more than a paycheck; on the other hand, we value our partnership in our clients’ future success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Oliver went wrong is when he questioned why anyone would invite their financial advisor to their wedding. We are proof that a relationship like that is possible between client and advisor. As a fiduciary, when we consistently act in the best interests of our clients, we end up building strong friendships with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we have long been at the forefront of the fiduciary movement for transparency and conflict-free advice. At a traditional insurance company or wire house, advisors will often recommend expensive funds produced by their institution; on the other hand, we can take a more holistic view of investments to determine which are best for you. We believe in growing with you, not at your expense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We encourage you to trust your retirement to an advisor who will act only in your best interest.

But the reality is that most investors are actually underperforming their benchmark. Two recent articles regarding behavioral finance — <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051116/which-investor-personality-best-describes-you/\">Which Investor Personality Best Describes You?</a></em> and <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051916/8-common-biases-impact-investment-decisions/\"><em>8 Common Investor Biases That Impact Investment Decisions</em></a> — detail a concept which is the thought that our own instinctive behaviors are the biggest challenge to us as investors. Another topic that we have written on is the issue with trying to “time” the market. What people often don’t realize is that these two concepts have more in common than you might think.</p>\n<p>For over two decades, financial research firm Dalbar has been analyzing investor returns. It recently published its 22<sup>nd</sup> annual <em><a href=\"http://www.dalbar.com/ProductsServices/DALBARPresentsQAIB/tabid/357/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior</a></em> study that compared these investor equity fund returns versus the market benchmark. The results showed significant underperformance from investors. <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/04/26/832952/0/en/Better-Investment-Recommendations-equals-Greater-Returns-DALBAR-Annual-Report-of-Investor-Returns-Says-Not-So.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dalbar points out</a> that “for the 30 years ended Dec. 31, 2015, the S&amp;P 500 index produced an annual return of 10.35%, while the average equity mutual fund investor earned only 3.66%. The gap of 6.69 percentage points represents the diminished returns.”</p>\n<p>So why is this the case?</p>\n<p>As advisors, we have long preached the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">importance of cost</a> and the large effects it can have on returns. While cost is a factor in investor underperformance, there are other factors that play even a larger role. The study showed that the biggest contributing factor to equity investors&#8217; underperformance over the past 20 years is voluntary investor behavior. What does that mean? Let’s look at a couple of examples of investor behavior that contributes to underperformance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>1. Panic selling: </strong>The No. 1 rule in a market collapse is not to panic. Markets can be erratic with times of larger-than-normal volatility. Responding emotionally is never a good idea. Start by understanding what your risk tolerance is. At that point, make sure you understand your investments and what their purpose is in your portfolio. Finally, look at your portfolio as a whole and make sure it is aligned properly with your risk tolerance and goals.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>2. Trend chasing/herd mentality/FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):</strong> As the phrase goes: what you see is what you believe. When investors see a stock continue to go up, or everyone around them is talking about buying that stock, it is easy to follow the crowd and jump in without thinking. History has shown us that past performance is no guarantee of future returns.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>3. Overconfidence: </strong>Many investors feel they perform better than what is actually happening or real. This can cause investors to believe they can accurately time the markets.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\"

But where can a Millennial turn for advice?</p>\n<p>Goals, dreams, jobs, family plans, etc. are going to vary widely, but there a few common themes that seem relevant across the spectrum. We constantly write on many of these issues, so decided to summarize the topics for you and answer some of those nagging questions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting started</strong> is often the hardest part. Beginning a savings plan early is key, which makes planning all the more important. We constantly preach the importance of determining your short, intermediate and long term goals and then focusing on creating a plan on how to achieve them. Having the “money conversation” is a great way to get started. Remember, it’s not how much you make, but how much you save.

So how do you determine if your focus should be on accelerating the payoff of that debt or maximizing saving instead? We wrote about that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/save-money-pay-debt/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Save%20Money%20or%20Pay%20Down%20Debt\">here</a><u>.</u></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investing</strong> &#8211; Only 26 percent of people under age 30 own stocks, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/more-millennials-say-no-to-stocks-and-advisors-adapt.html\">CNBC story. </a>Time is one of the greatest assets Millennials have working in their favor. Yet  because of various reasons that have scared many away from the stock market, a vast majority of millennials are missing out on <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Volatility%20and%20Compound%20Interest\">potential compound interest</a><u>, and other benefits of long term investing</u>.

A recent <a href=\"http://insights.fb.com/2016/01/25/millennials-money-the-unfiltered-journey/\">facebook study</a> shows that over 50% of millennials have no one to trust for financial guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Picture1-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3616 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Picture1-1.png\" alt=\"FB Study\" width=\"696\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Picture1-1.png 696w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Picture1-1-300x117.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://insights.fb.com/2016/01/25/millennials-money-the-unfiltered-journey/\">insights.fb.com</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A few months back we wrote a piece titled <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Why%20Go%20Where%20Money%20Not%20Wanted\">“Why Go Where Your Money’s Not Wanted” </a>that touches on the point of many financial institutions turning down Millennials as clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades. As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first time investors, it’s actually one of the main reasons I created Sherman Wealth Management. It was important to me to make sure top notch financial advice was available to anyone and everyone,  particularly to those who are starting out on the path to wealth accumulation. We created this guide to make sure you are asking your potential financial advisors the right questions to determine if they are right for you. – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=6%20questions%20to%20ask%20advisor\">6 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marriage</strong> &#8211; Getting married is more than just substituting the word “ours” for “yours” and “mine”. It’s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions – even your music – and making all of that “ours” too. If you have started to think about marriage, or are married already, there are a few financial discussions you should be sure you have.  Since a significant part of those pre-marital dreams and aspirations involve money, having multiple financial conversations before marriage (or right after, if you’re newlyweds!) can help you start married life on a firmer footing, with regard to financial goals. Here are two blogs we wrote for those getting married or already married.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/10-things-to-discuss-before-marriage/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=10%20Things%20Before%20Marriage\">10 Things to Discuss Before Marriage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/7-things-married-couples-discuss-today/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=7%20Things%20Married%20Couples%20Should%20Discuss\">7 Things Married Couples Should Discuss Today</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buying a house</strong> &#8211; There are studies out there saying that Millennials are not buying houses. A prudent home purchase often can be one of the most stable and solid investments a young person can make. So why the hesitation? Some Millennials wonder if given the rate increase and current market turmoil – if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now? We wrote about this exact topic <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/do-interest-rates-have-you-worried-about-buying-a-first-home/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Interest%20Rates%20Buying%20House\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kids </strong>&#8211; Babies change your life in many ways, including requiring large amounts of time and money. While you may already be thinking about childcare costs and options, or about paying the medical bills that accompanied your new child, there are several other – important – financial considerations you should be thinking about even before the new baby arrives – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-planning-tips-new-parents/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=5%20Planning%20Tips%20for%20New%20Parents\">5 Planning Tips for New Parents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this all seems overwhelming, don’t be discouraged. Personal finance is a journey and everyone is going to take a slightly different path.

In previously discussing behavioral finance, we focused on <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investor-personality-best-describes/\">four common personality types of investors</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s focus on the common behavioral biases that affect our investment decisions.</p>\n<p>The concept of behavioral finance helps us recognize our natural biases that lead us to making illogical and often irrational decisions when it comes to investments and finances. A prime example of this is the concept of prospect theory, which is the idea that as humans, our emotional response to perceived losses is different than to that of perceived gains. According to prospect theory, losses for an investor feel twice as painful as gains feel good. Some investors worry more about the marginal percentage change in their wealth than they do about the amount of their wealth. This thought process is backwards and can cause investors to fixate on the wrong issues.</p>\n<p>The chart below is a great example of this emotional rollercoaster and how it impacts our investment decisions.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/8_common_biases_that/image001.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h2>The Psychology of Investing Biases</h2>\n<p>Behavioral biases hit us all as investors and can vary depending upon our investor personality type. These biases can be cognitive, illustrated by a tendency to think and act in a certain way or follow a rule of thumb. Biases can also be emotional: a tendency to take action based on feeling rather than fact.</p>\n<p>Pulled from a <a href=\"http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=286116065002000088064002074106019097023057071055063005125104112022119101005085097014107106052111061028034095091106066028101028102070004033004122011011095091091010055044031092114081116083016100025003099116123064120027097100019064066081120127086022074&amp;EXT=pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> by H. Kent Baker and Victor Ricciardi that looks at how biases impact investor behavior, here are eight biases that can affect investment decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anchoring or Confirmation Bias:</strong> First impressions can be hard to shake because we tend to selectively filter, paying more attention to information that supports our opinions while ignoring the rest. Likewise, we often resort to preconceived opinions when encountering something — or someone — new. An investor whose thinking is subject to confirmation bias would be more likely to look for information that supports his or her original idea about an investment rather than seek out information that contradicts it.</li>\n<li><strong>Regret Aversion Bias: </strong>Also known as loss aversion, regret aversion describes wanting to avoid the feeling of regret experienced after making a choice with a negative outcome. Investors who are influenced by anticipated regret take less risk because it lessens the potential for poor outcomes. Regret aversion can explain an investor&#8217;s reluctance to sell losing investments to avoid confronting the fact that they have made poor decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Disposition Effect Bias: </strong>This refers to a tendency to label investments as winners or losers. Disposition effect bias can lead an investor to hang onto an investment that no longer has any upside or sell a winning investment too early to make up for previous losses. This is harmful because it can increase capital gains taxes and can reduce returns even before taxes.</li>\n<li><strong>Hindsight Bias:</strong> Another common perception bias is hindsight bias, which leads an investor to believe after the fact that the onset of a past event was predictable and completely obvious whereas, in fact, the event could not have been reasonably predicted.</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarity Bias:</strong> This occurs when investors have a preference for familiar or well-known investments despite the seemingly obvious gains from diversification. The investor may feel anxiety when diversifying investments between well known domestic securities and lesser known international securities, as well as between both familiar and unfamiliar stocks and bonds that are outside of his or her comfort zone. This can lead to suboptimal portfolios with a greater a risk of losses.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-attribution Bias:</strong> Investors who suffer from self-attribution bias tend to attribute successful outcomes to their own actions and bad outcomes to external factors. They often exhibit this bias as a means of self-protection or self-enhancement. Investors affected by self-attribution bias may become overconfident.</li>\n<li><strong>Trend-chasing Bias:</strong> Investors often chase past performance in the mistaken belief that historical returns predict future investment performance. This tendency is complicated by the fact that some product issuers may increase advertising when past performance is high to attract new investors. Research demonstrates, however, that investors do not benefit because performance usually fails to persist in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Worry:</strong> The act of worrying is a natural — and common — human emotion. Worry evokes memories and creates visions of possible future scenarios that alter an investor’s judgment about personal finances. Anxiety about an investment increases its perceived risk and lowers the level of risk tolerance. To avoid this bias, investors should match their level of risk tolerance with an appropriate asset allocation strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Avoiding Behavioral Mistakes</h2>\n<p>By understanding the common behavioral mistakes investors make, a quality financial planner will aim to help clients take the emotion out of investing by creating a tactical, strategic investment plan customized to the individual. Some examples of strategies that help with this include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Systematic Asset Allocation: </strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We utilize investment strategies</a> such as dollar cost averaging to create a systematic plan of attack that takes advantage of market fluctuations, even in a down market period.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Mitigation: </strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investor-risk-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The starting point</a> of any investment plan starts with understanding an individual&#8217;s risk tolerance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important aspect of behavioral finance is peace of mind. By having a thorough understanding of your risk appetite, the purpose of each investment in your portfolio and the implementation plan of your strategy, it allows you to feel much more confident about your investment plan and be less likely to make common behavioral mistakes.</p>\n<p>Working with a financial planner can help investors recognize and understand their own individual behavioral biases and predispositions, and thus be able to avoid making investment decisions based entirely on those biases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This is commonly referred to as behavioral finance. As part of a two-part series on Behavioral Finance, we will start by exploring the different personality types of most investors. When it comes to money and investing, there are many factors that contribute to the “how” and “why” of important financial decisions.</p>\n<h2>Investor Personality Types</h2>\n<p>There are four different types of investors, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/pwmn.v2012.n1.5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFA Institute</a>, each with their own distinct behavioral biases. Understanding your own investor personality type can go a long way toward helping you determine and meet your long term investment goals, as well as producing better returns. (For more from Brad Sherman, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\"><em>6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Which of these profiles best describes you?</p>\n<h2>Preservers</h2>\n<p>Preservers are investors who place a great deal of emphasis on financial security and on preserving wealth rather than taking <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\">risks</a> to grow wealth. Preservers watch closely over their assets and are anxious about losses and short-term performance. Preservers also have trouble taking action for fear of making the wrong investments decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Preservers:</strong> An investment strategy should take into account short-, mid- and long-term goals. By overemphasizing short-term returns, an investor risks making an emotional decision based on the short-term performance, which may end up being more detrimental to them in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Accumulators</h2>\n<p>Accumulators are investors who are interested in accumulating wealth and are confident they can do so. Accumulators tend to want to steer the ship when it comes to making investment decisions. They are risk takers and typically believe that whatever path they choose is the correct one. Accumulators have frequently been successful in prior business endeavors and are confident that they will make successful investors as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Common issue with Accumulators:</strong> Overconfidence. We recently wrote a blog on the issue with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock picking</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">active management.</a> Overconfidence is a natural human tendency. As investors, accumulators consistently overestimate their ability to predict future returns. History has shown that it is impossible to predict markets at large scale, yet accumulators continue to try and do so and expose themselves to extreme risk.</p>\n<h2>Followers</h2>\n<p>Followers are investors who tend to follow the lead of their friends and colleagues, a general investing fad, or the status quo, rather than having their own ideas or making their own decisions about investing. Followers may lack interest and/or knowledge of the financial markets and their decision-making process may lack a long-term plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Followers:</strong> The herd mentality is a concept of investors piling into the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/diversification-gluten-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same investments as others</a>. This is often the basis of investment bubbles and subsequent crashes in the stock market. When you are a follower, you are typically following fund managers who have tools and recourses to act on new information in a fraction of a second. By the time the average investor “follows” them into a position, it is often too late. It is always important to understand your investment decisions and how they fit into your overall plan.</p>\n<h2>Independents</h2>\n<p>Independents are investors who have original ideas about investing and like to be involved in the investment process. Unlike followers, they are very interested in the process of investing, and are engaged in the financial markets. Many Independents are analytical and critical thinkers and trust themselves to make confident and informed decisions, but risk the pitfalls of only following their own research.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Independents:</strong> Similar to overconfidence bias associated with accumulators, independents face similar issues with relying too heavily on their own train of thought. We as humans have ability to convince ourselves that we are correct or that we don’t need guidance, even when that is not the case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

We caught up on wives, kids, work and all the other important parts of our lives. One thing struck me about the conversations, no matter whether I was speaking with liberal arts majors or those who studied corporate finance: While we all know that E=MC2 and maybe even know a fair amount about Einstein’s theory, most of them graduated without having a real clue about personal finance.</p>\n<p>In other words, the financial skills we learn in school are not necessarily the ones we need in the real world — at least when it comes to our personal lives.</p>\n<p>Personal finance is not typically part of a college curriculum. And while some of us have parents or family members who can guide us along the way, those individuals may not be financial experts, and there is a limit to the help they can provide.</p>\n<p>From my experience, most people are interested in financial literacy but don’t know where to go to get started. We all face similar issues, and the less familiar we are with the mechanics of approaching them, the more anxiety-provoking they become.</p>\n<p>The younger you learn, the better off you are. When I was in the first grade, I wanted to be Alex P. Keaton, the money-savvy teenager played by Michael J. Fox on the television sitcom “Family Ties.” It was clear early on that I had an affinity for sound saving, investing and growing money. When I was 7, my grandmother gave me a dollar; I turned it into $5, then $50. I am thrilled by the challenge of helping people reach their financial goals at all stages of their lives.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/do-interest-rates-have-you-worried-about-buying-a-first-home/\" rel=\"nofollow\">buying that first home</a>. Your career is on track, and becoming a homeowner seems like an appropriate goal. So with some excitement and anticipation, you decide to start looking.</p>\n<p>Then the questions begin flooding in. How much home can I afford? How much should I be saving? When is the ideal time to buy? How does a mortgage work? Will I qualify? What’s my credit score? Do I need insurance? How do property taxes work?</p>\n<p>Imagine if there were a course in college (let’s not get crazy and imagine they would teach this in high school) called Personal Finance 101. In addition to the homebuying lessons above, the curriculum could look something like this:</p>\n<h3>Cash flow and budgeting</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What is a budget? <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/160946766\" rel=\"nofollow\">How do I create one?</a> How do I know what I can afford?</p>\n<h3>Building credit and understanding credit cards</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What are the advantages and disadvantages of owning a credit card? How should I decide which one to get?</p>\n<h3>Intro to the stock market and investing</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What are the differences in the various investment vehicles — exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit?</p>\n<h3>Taxes</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> How do I pay taxes? What do I need to pay attention to in my <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tax planning</a>?</p>\n<h3>Future workplace retirement plan options</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\">What is a 401(k),</a> IRA, Roth IRA? When should I start saving? How much should I save?</p>\n<p>My guess is that a course like this would be incredibly valuable to many. It’s complicated stuff. It’s important stuff. It’s the kind of stuff that you actually need to know.</p>\n<p>This is the main reason I chose to get in this line of work. Younger people have no idea where or how to start, and they have no idea where to find help. Traditional financial management institutions have investment minimums that most of us won’t be able to meet for over a decade, if ever. These minimums can range from $250,000 to $500,000, and sometimes are higher. Even if you were fortunate enough to be accepted by a big institutional investment manager, you’re kidding yourself if you think a large institution is going to take the time to explain to you the difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.</p>\n<p>That’s why I chose to create a wealth management model where we would provide the same customized service to all of our clients, without consideration of a minimum initial investment and irrespective of the size of their accounts. We hope that by investing in you early, you’ll see our value for the long term.</p>\n<p>If you are reading this and can relate to some of these thoughts, know that it’s not just you. It doesn’t matter whether you majored in art or corporate finance, you almost certainly did not take a class in Personal Finance 101. The good news is, you don’t have to go at it alone. Seek the help that is out there, and learn what you may have missed in college.</p>\n<p>This article was originally published on NerdWallet.com</p>\n<p><em>This article also appears on <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-personal-finance-classes-should-be-taught-in-college-cm610810\">Nasdaq</a>.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

A good financial advisor is there to prevent you from making decisions that would have a negative, unintended impact on you. Who wouldn’t love to have a financial coach to keep you on track to achieve your financial goals?</p>\n<p>Just like with any working relationship, it’s a good idea to interview advisors until you find the one who is the best fit for you, your life, and your financial goals. Since you are entrusting your financial well-being to someone, you should get to know them and their financial planning and<u> </u>investing philosophy before committing to a long-term relationship.</p>\n<p>As you may have heard the Department of Labor (DOL) has just released its new fiduciary rule in its final form. We previously wrote about the reasons why someone would <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">oppose this rule</a> considering it was created to improve financial transparency and eliminate conflicted advice from advisors. While this rule would still allow advisors to keep their “conflicted” commissions in some instances, it would require advisors to act as fiduciaries (a.k.a. “best interests contract”) when handling client’s retirement accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/\">We have long been proponents</a> of more transparency and conflict-free advice and feel this is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>So how does this affect your search for the right financial advisor? Here are 6 questions to ask to help with finding a financial advisor.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Are You a Fiduciary? (Are You ALWAYS a Fiduciary?)<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, this new rule will only require financial advisors to act as a fiduciary for client’s <u>retirement accounts</u>. A fiduciary is regulated by federal law and must adhere to strict standards. They must act in the client’s best interest, in good faith, and they must provide full disclosure regarding fees, compensation, and any current or potential conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Until now, broker-dealers, insurance salesman, bank and financial company representatives, and others were only required to follow a Suitability Standard. That means they only had to provide recommendations that are “suitable” for a client – based on age or aversion to risk for example – but this may or may not be in that client’s best interest.</p>\n<p>The brokerage industry, as you can probably imagine, and all those who earn their compensation from commissions are strongly against these new rules.</p>\n<p>Even with this new law passed, we feel it is important to make sure your advisor is acting as a fiduciary when dealing with ANY of your finances, not just retirement accounts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2. What is Your Fee Structure? (Difference Between Fee-Only, Fee-Based and Commission)</strong></h3>\n<p>Advisors throw out terms like “fee-based” and consumers assume that is the same as<br />\n“fee-only.” That is not the case. At Sherman Wealth Management, we are fee-only which means that we are paid <u>exclusively</u> by our clients, so we are completely <strong>conflict-free</strong>. We do not get commissions from the investments or products we recommend. We do not get bonuses based on how many clients we get to invest in company products. We are paid an hourly or quarterly fee by our clients who retain us because we are making their money work for them with only their best interest in mind.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent your best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you.</p>\n<p>Do not assume that an advisor is following a fiduciary standard with their compensation now. The new rules will not be enforced until 2018. Ask your financial advisor to clearly specify their fees. With many layers of diversification that can be applied to your portfolio, you want to be aware of whether you are exposed to up-front charges, back-end fees, expense ratios, and/or whether a percentage of your returns will be deducted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Why Are They Right for YOU?</strong></h3>\n<p>A financial advisor should be able to tell you their strengths and what sets them apart. Some advisors will advise on investments while others specialize in comprehensive financial planning. While you may think all advisors are the same, and it certainly may seem like that on the surface, by now you should be seeing that is not the case.</p>\n<p>Ask how involved they are with their client’s portfolios. Are they hands-on in their approach? How available are they for their clients’ needs?</p>\n<p>For us, we enjoy serving a wide-range of clients, from young first-timers who are just getting started with investing and financial planning, to experienced savers, to high-net-worth investors who are well on their way to financial independence.</p>\n<p>We strive to understand our clients wants and needs. We help our clients plan for the long term while simultaneously working to avoid short-term roadblocks. We do so by making it a point to SHOW you that you are not alone. We’re just like you, we’ve been there, and we know that financial planning can be an anxiety provoking activity for many. We use a fluid process to help set clear, realistic goals with an easy to understand roadmap of what you need to do to get there. We are right there with you every step of the way.</p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s world you don’t just want a trusted advisor, you want instant access to your accounts and the progress you are making. That is why we offer some of the best in new financial services technology tools.</p>\n<p>[video_embed video=&#8221;160946766&#8243; parameters=&#8221;&#8221; mp4=&#8221;&#8221; ogv=&#8221;&#8221; placeholder=&#8221;&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8243; height=&#8221;281&#8243;]</p>\n<p>The relationship with your financial advisor is an important one. You need to feel comfortable with whom you are working with.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4. What is Your Investment Philosophy?</strong></h3>\n<p>Every financial advisor has a specific approach to planning and investing. Some advisors prefer trying to time the market and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\">actively manage funds versus passive investments.</a> Others may seek to gain high returns and make riskier investments. Your goals and risk tolerance need to align with the advisor’s philosophy.</p>\n<p>When anyone invests money, they are doing so with the hopes of growing it faster than inflation. While some traditional investment managers not only want to generate a profitable return, they aim to beat the market by taking advantage of pricing discrepancies and attempting to time the market and predict the future. Some investment companies offer “one-size-fits-all” investment management solutions that only take into account your age and income.</p>\n<p>We have a different approach. We believe an individuals best chance at building wealth through the capital markets is to avoid common <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-finance-instinctive-behaviors/\">behavioral biases</a> in the beginning and utilize a well thought out, disciplined, and long-term approach to investing. We create a well diversified, customized portfolio that focuses on tax efficiency, cost effectiveness, and risk management. Read more about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">how we do this. </a></p>\n<p>Make it a top priority to understand the strategy your advisor uses and that you are comfortable with it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>5. How Personalized Are Your Recommendations for Your Clients? </strong></h3>\n<p>It is important that your financial advisor tailors your financial plan to your specific goals. Your retirement plan and investment strategy should be customized to take into account your risk tolerance, age, income, net-worth, and other factors specific to your situation. There should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to managing your money.</p>\n<p>Some traditional brokers and insurance companies are so big that it becomes impossible for them to give you a truly individualized experience. They have a corporate agenda that they must follow and it can restrict the service they provide to you.</p>\n<p>As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first-time investors, it has also inspired a new breed of smaller independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs), like Sherman Wealth Management. What our clients all have in common is that they appreciate the focus on their own individual goals and best interests that we guarantee as a boutique, independent, fee-only fiduciary.</p>\n<p>We know that each client is unique.  We don’t look for “market efficiencies” or work for sales commissions on the products we recommend. Our focus is different. We strive to help investors build a strong foundation and grow with them, not by profiting off good or bad trades. This gives us the opportunity to create individual strategies and plans that are uniquely suited to each client, not just a cookie-cutter plan based on age, income, or broadly assessed risk tolerance.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h3><strong>6. Do You Have Any Asset or Revenue Minimums?</strong></h3>\n<p>Some have argued that the proposed DOL rule will end up hurting the small investor because larger institutions will not be willing to serve small accounts. This logic is fundamentally backward and flawed, as those clients were never on their radar to begin with. In fact, the ability for these large institutions to generate commissions and thus charge more to these small investor clients have driven that business, without regard to the best interests of the individual investor.</p>\n<p>For example, In a company statement quoted by <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/12/18/wells-fargo-2016-comp-plan-pushes-fas-to-give-away\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Janet Levaux</a> in Think Advisor, Wells Fargo, the most valuable financial institution in the world according to the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-co-is-the-earths-most-valuable-bank-1437538216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall Street Journal</a>, said that in 2016, “bonuses will be awarded to FAs with 75% of their client households at $250,000.”</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo isn’t the only large institution effectively ignoring Millennials and other smaller and entry-level clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net-worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades.</p>\n<p>The complaints against the new DOL rule have nothing to do with protecting the little guy. Rather, the complaints are driven by the desire of commission-based large institutions, insurance companies, and broker-dealers who are trying to protect their ability to generate commissions and charge clients unnecessary fees.</p>\n<p>Make sure you understand your advisor’s motivations. If they don’t want you, why should you want them?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

A fiduciary standard ensures that the advisor&#8217;s duty is to the client only, not the corporation they represent. To the surprise of many, that currently is not always the case. Financial advisors have had the ability to profit (through commissions and high fees) to the potential detriment of their clients. That is exactly what many large financial institutions and insurance companies have done. In fact, the federal government estimates that there are roughly <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/cea_coi_report_final.pdf\">$17 billion dollars</a> of fees generated each year from conflicted advice.</p>\n<p>The DOL has made clear &#8211;and we agree&#8211; that a commission based investment model creates a conflict of interest. Companies with a commission based model operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest. For example, an advisor may receive a 5% commission by selling you a fund through their company when you could get a similar product elsewhere without commission. Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent your best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you. That is the primary reason we stay completely independent and operate as conflict-free, fee-only advisors.</p>\n<p>The proposed DOL rule will hopefully begin to fix this issue as it is expected to require a strict fiduciary standard for financial advisors in the context of sales for retirement account products.  This standard will require advisors to certify that they are acting independently and in their client’s best interest, and are not motivated by the prospect of a commission. This has created a firestorm among big insurance companies, broker dealers and other institutional investors who, as we pointed out, don’t typically operate as fiduciaries.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/306476032/Elizabeth-Warren-letter-to-SEC?secret_password=aGGzGnDFye7HhhQe5m4V\">letter sent last week to the SEC</a>, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a strong proponent of the proposed DOL rule, pointed out that presidents of Transamerica, Lincoln National, Jackson National and Prudential all have called this proposal “unworkable.”  She commented on the self interest in their position, and the danger in permitting unwitting investors to be guided by non-fiduciaries in the context of their retirement investments.</p>\n<p>Why would a rule that requires a financial advisor to act in their client&#8217;s best interest create such an uproar? One reason is that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unlike Sherman Wealth Management</a>, they are in a commission driven model, and therefore fear that the way they currently serve clients would not meet the standards of this new rule. We hope that because of the conflict a commission driven model creates, that eventually enough pressure from policy-makers like Senator Warren and Labor Secretary Perez will propel this proposed new rule beyond just retirement accounts. In the meantime, think to yourself why anyone would oppose this rule if not for purely selfish reasons?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

A manager who outperformed last year may not do it again this year.</p>\n<h3><strong>Reasons for underperformance</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a few main reasons actively managed funds underperform, aside from picking the wrong investments:</p>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/mutual-fund-fees-what-investors-need-to-know/\">FEES</a></strong></h4>\n<p>Many actively managed funds charge 1% to 2% per year in management fees, while a passively managed exchange-traded fund could charge as little as 0.1% to 0.2% per year. And many actively managed mutual funds are <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/125.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loaded funds</a>, which means you’ll pay a sales charge, typically between 4% to 8% of your investment, when you buy or sell the fund — though the fee may decrease the longer you stay invested. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=active%20vs%20passive&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dollar%20cost%20averaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compounded over time</a>, these higher fees can eat up a lot of gain, reducing overall returns.</p>\n<h4><strong>TAXES</strong></h4>\n<p>Because actively managed funds try to time the market and pick winners, they buy and sell positions frequently. These transaction costs reduce the fund’s returns, and all the buying and selling can also create taxable gain. Fund managers have no incentive to avoid this because they simply pass those taxable gains on to you, the shareholder.</p>\n<h4><strong>MARKET EFFICIENCY</strong></h4>\n<p>Some argue that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13stra.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">markets are becoming more efficient</a>, making it difficult to identify overvalued or undervalued stocks. The efficient market hypothesis states that stocks are constantly adjusting to news and information, and thus their share prices reflect their “fair value.” In simpler language, other than in the very short term, there are no undervalued stocks to buy or inflated stocks to sell. This makes it virtually impossible to outperform the market through individual stock selection and market timing.</p>\n<h3><strong>An unsustainable approach</strong></h3>\n<p>Whether active management can outperform is a controversial topic. Many experts dismiss the science and say that they can indeed beat the market. Some of them may even do so for a year or two, or even five, but what about over the long run? It’s simply not sustainable, and to think otherwise is dangerous.</p>\n<p>If the data shows that the vast majority of the brightest and most well-equipped professional investors can’t beat their benchmarks, why should you believe anyone who says they can?</p>\n<p><em>This story also appears on <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/dont-expect-to-win-with-actively-managed-funds-cm597983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nasdaq</a>.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Cherry blossoms are out, baseball opening day is right around the corner, and the best single elimination tournament in sports is on its way. That’s right, it’s March Madness time.</p>\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar, March Madness, as it’s commonly called, is a 64-team college basketball single elimination tournament. There are four regions that each have 16 teams seeded 1 though 16. The winners of each region meet in the “final four” to determine who will emerge as the champion.</p>\n<p>Offices around the country are buzzing with brackets, upset picks and friendly wagers. In other words, it’s chaos both on and off the court and it’s glorious!</p>\n<p>In case you couldn’t tell, I love sports. As a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Most%20Important%20Question%20to%20Ask%20Financial%20Advisor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial advisor</a>, I am constantly looking at seemingly unrelated topics, and comparing them to the world of finance. What may come as a surprise to you is that investing and March Madness have more in common than you think.</p>\n<p>So what does the tournament have to do with investing? Let’s have some fun and take a look.</p>\n<p><strong>You Can’t Predict the Future</strong></p>\n<p>Every year people get excited about their bracket. We watch the “experts” on TV and eagerly listen to their reasons for picking one team over another. We all go into the season thinking that this is “our year.” We’ve done the research and we’ve studied history. What could possibly go wrong?</p>\n<p>In the first round of this year’s tournament, a record 10 double-digit seeds advanced to the second round! Do you think a lot of people predicted that? Not a chance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3064\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3064 size-medium\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1-300x194.jpg\" alt=\"March Madness Brackets\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Have you ever heard the saying on Wall Street that past performance does not guarantee future performance? There’s a reason the saying exists. Just like last year’s successful mutual fund managers aren’t any more likely to pick this year’s best accounts, the winner of last year’s bracket pool is no more likely than you to pick this year’s winning March Madness team.</p>\n<p>When it comes to investing, “experts” love to tell us what is going to happen in the future. People brag about their best stock picks and conveniently leave out their poor ones. <strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Stock%20Picking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The truth is, no one knows what is coming.</a></strong> Once you accept that, you can create a financial plan that takes into account your <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/embed/90260b609e67a973f2f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk tolerance</a>, and current life situation to make the best investment decisions for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification and Risk vs. Reward</strong></p>\n<p>No one picks a perfect bracket. The odds of filling out a perfect bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion (source: <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/03/19/ncaa-tournament-perfect-bracket-odds-quintillion/1999795/\">USA Today</a>). According to that number, if everyone in the US filled out one bracket each year, we would see a perfect bracket once every 400 years. You’d be better off gambling with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/powerball-ticket/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Power%20Ball\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the lottery</a> based on those odds.</p>\n<p>However, straying from the standard “favorites” isn’t always the answer either. People love to pick the underdog or “dark horse,” but if you do this consistently year after year, you aren’t likely to have much success. <strong>That doesn’t mean you can’t pick an underdog here or there, but the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Stock%20Picking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risky picks</a> should be a subset of your overall picks, not the full strategy. </strong></p>\n<p>The truth is, no one wins a bracket pool by picking all favorites or all upsets. As the point above taught us, everyone is just guessing. By diversifying your picks with some favorites and some upsets, you give yourself the best chance at success.</p>\n<p>The same principal applies with investing. If your portfolio is composed of stocks from one sector or all growth stocks, you are exposing yourself to huge amounts of risk. Sure, the reward may be great if you end up being right, but as we’ve seen time and time again, that is a strategy that can set you up for disaster.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

But there’s a problem with this method of investing. Like gambling in Vegas, it may be fun and even rewarding in the short term. Yet in the end, just as the house always wins, picking stocks is a losing game.</p>\n<p>I talk to friends all the time who say they invest in stocks — meaning individual ones rather than broad-based index funds that capture the movement of the entire market — and I always wonder why. I think many people see a company that carries a well-known name — maybe they are customers or they hear about it on the news — and they assume it’s a good investment. But history has shown us time and time again that picking stocks of individual companies, and thus trying to determine which will be the winners, is not a good investment strategy.</p>\n<p>No company is immune to short- or long-term failure, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-valeant-dilemma-how-diversified-is-your-diversification/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=stock%20picking&amp;utm_campaign=valeant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no matter how good they look in the moment</a>. The company’s value may not go to zero, but it could certainly take a huge hit relative to its underlying industry or index. Just think about <a href=\"http://snip.ly/4evwv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index has changed</a> in the past two decades. There has been a revolving door among the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500, proving that even the biggest companies out there are not immune to <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/\">volatility</a> and risk.</p>\n<h3>Individual stocks vs. an index</h3>\n<p>As further evidence that picking stocks is risky and ultimately a losing game, consider recent research from financial firm <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/Eye_on_the_Market_September_2014_-_Executive_Summary.pdf?blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1320684901654&amp;blobheader=application/pdf&amp;blobheadername1=Cache-Control&amp;blobheadervalue1=private&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</a> It compared the Russell 3000 index — which, as the company notes, “represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market” — between 1980 and 2014 with information on individual stocks. Here are the three main findings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The risk of ‘catastrophic’ failure </strong><strong>among individual stocks is </strong><strong>higher than you think. </strong>“When looking at how often a stock has what we call a ‘catastrophic decline’ — falling 70% or more and never recovering — we see that 40% of all stocks suffer this fate at some time in their history. And some sectors — like telecom, biotech and energy — saw higher-than-average loss rates,” the report states.</li>\n<li><strong>Most stocks underperform over their lifetime.</strong> According to the report, “The data shows that two-thirds of all individual stocks underperform over their ‘lifetime,’ as compared to the Russell 3000. On average, the outcome for individual stocks was underperformance of about 50%.”</li>\n<li><strong>Concentrated holdings in individual stocks add huge amounts of risk to your portfolio.</strong> “When computing the optimal risk-adjusted return for a concentrated holder,” the report notes, “we find that 75% of concentrated stockholders would benefit from some degree of diversification.”</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why investors keep picking stocks</h3>\n<p>So why do so many individuals keep trying to pick stocks? I see two main reasons.</p>\n<p>We all enjoy making money, and we don’t usually associate the word “boring” with something we enjoy. That reason alone likely explains why so many people try to pick stocks. It’s the “sexy” way to invest. But the research is clear that this is not an optimal strategy. When it comes to investing, “sexy” might as well be spelled “sucker.”</p>\n<p>Rather, investing should be boring. It’s like baseball: Base hits are the name of the game. By properly diversifying your investment portfolio — picking a mix of asset classes with exposure to many sectors and countries — with a long-term strategy, you allow yourself to take advantage of compounded gains without subjecting yourself to unnecessary risk (i.e., swinging for the fences).</p>\n<p>The other major issue is that not all investors understand what they are doing. When you’re stock-picking, you may think that you are diversified by owning five different stocks; but if that’s all you own, you’re exposing yourself to a huge amount of risk by having such a large percentage of your portfolio invested in just one stock or industry. One catastrophic loss could devastate your portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Diversification</h3>\n<p>The logical question you might have is, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=stock%20picking&amp;utm_campaign=Most%20Important%20Question%20to%20Ask%20Financial%20Advisor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“OK, so what should I do?” </a>While answers are going to vary slightly for each individual, one applies across the board: Diversify. That doesn’t mean owning many different individual stocks in the same sector, but rather spreading your investments throughout multiple asset classes, industries and countries. Proper diversification of your portfolio is key to your investing success over the long run.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Now reality has set in.</p>\n<p>As with all market corrections, this one has inspired retail investors to question whether it’s time to pull money out, shift to safer and more stable investments or just throw in the towel entirely.</p>\n<p>While it is normal to feel anxiety during a downturn, there’s another way to look at it. As long as downturns and dips don’t affect your financial plan or, more specifically, your immediate need for cash, they can be an opportunity.</p>\n<p>Remember the mantra “buy low and sell high”? The volatility, geopolitical risk and uncertainty we’ve experienced so far in 2016 have presented a particular opportunity for investors in the accumulation stage of their lives, or for anyone who has money but hasn’t started investing yet, to actually buy low (or at least lower). If you’ve been delaying investing regularly because the “market was too high” or “you knew a correction was coming,” now might be a good time to start.</p>\n<p>The key is to view volatility — like what we experienced last August and what we are seeing now — as a tool to keep contributing regularly to your investments. This will let you maximize the possible potential for your investments and enable you to watch them grow. The two best concepts to help you do that are dollar-cost averaging and compounded interest.</p>\n<h3>Dollar-cost averaging</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/dollar-cost-averaging/\">Dollar-cost averaging</a> is the process of spreading out the costs of your investments as the market rises and falls, rather than purchasing shares all at one (potentially higher) price. The key is to pick a schedule — whether it’s monthly, bimonthly or weekly — and an amount, no matter how small, and stick to it by purchasing as many additional shares in your investments as your fixed amount will allow. This is much more effective than trying to “time” the market by buying shares when they are at their lowest or selling when they are at their highest.</p>\n<p>Using this system, you are regularly contributing the same amount, regardless of the price of shares. As a result, that fixed dollar amount buys more shares in times when the market has dropped and prices are low, and it limits the amount of shares when the market has risen and prices are high. Over time you will come out ahead, compared with trying to time the market.</p>\n<h3>Compound interest</h3>\n<p>Once you have started to build up the size of your investment with the help of dollar-cost averaging, the concept of <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/compound-interest-save-early/\">compound interest</a> gives you a boost. Compounded interest is the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment already has earned. If you have $1,000, for instance, and it earns 5% interest yearly, you will earn $50 at the end of the first year. Then, if you keep that money invested, the next year you will earn 5% interest on the total — $1,050 — which is $52.50. The following year, you will earn 5% on $1,102.50, which is a little more than $55.</p>\n<p>Because dips in prices allow you to buy more shares with a fixed amount, volatility allows you to maximize the potential for compound interest as well.</p>\n<p>Using these two concepts, the daily ups and downs and market corrections are not a cause for undue concern. If you are sticking to your dollar-cost averaging plan and taking advantage of compound interest, news events shouldn’t affect your long-term plans and goals. Any dollar that is invested in the stock market should be a dollar that you are comfortable keeping invested through a bear market or a major correction.</p>\n<p>If you are disciplined about investing, and consistent about reinvesting, you’ll start to look at market volatility as a tool and an opportunity, rather than as a source of anxiety or, worse, a reason to throw in the towel and lose out on long-term growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Economics is hard. Not in a &#8220;things are actually good today&#8221; way. But in mid-2008 surging oil prices and a falling dollar were a big headwind.”</p>\n<p>As a Financial Advisor, I read every piece of economic data available to me and follow the thought processes of the top thinkers at virtually all the key financial institutions so I can carefully invest money on behalf of our clients.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I’ve discovered: none of them, and none of us, have been given a roadmap to what the future holds. They can watch and study the relevant economic indicators, but they cannot predict the financial future with absolute certainty. We all live with uncertainty while trying to make the best decisions we can with the information available.</p>\n<p>Given the certainty of uncertainty, what can individuals do to best prepare for their financial future?</p>\n<p>With all of the speculation about the upcoming elections, questions about possible negative interest rates, and concerns about international instability, it’s easy to feel anxious about the potential effects on the economy and on your savings and investments. Particularly because the airwaves and the Internet are full of news reports, commentary, blogposts and Tweets about how volatile and risky the markets are.</p>\n<p>One thing that <em>is</em> certain: there will always be volatility and risk in the markets. That’s what makes the stock market the stock market. Even if we are currently experiencing a bit more than just normal market volatility, remember that the markets have historically rebounded extremely well after corrections (which are considered a drop of at least 10%). Don’t take my word for it, take a look at the chart below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2927\"><img class=\"wp-image-2927\" style=\"float: left; padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 10%; width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1-300x181.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.10 AM\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1-300x181.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1-1024x619.png 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1-768x464.png 768w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.28-AM-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2926\"><img class=\" wp-image-2926\" style=\"padding-right: 4%; width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.28-AM-300x182.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.28 AM\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2925\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2925 aligncenter\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1-300x183.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.44 AM\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1-300x183.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1-1024x623.png 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1-768x467.png 768w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>These charts show 27 corrections of at least 10% or more since 1987. All of those corrections had one thing in common: they all rebounded with a bullish rally. What history has shown is that, over the long run, markets continue to move higher.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for individual savers and investors? No matter your age or experience with financial planning and investments, there is one universal “must” that applies to everyone. You need a financial plan:  a carefully thought-out, customized financial plan, not just something you downloaded from Google. Once you have that plan in place, the next steps are to implement it, then put your head down and trust in that plan.</p>\n<p>This current market in particular highlights the importance of having a financial plan that is both age-appropriate and risk-adjusted to your specific financial situation, goals, and needs. If you&#8217;re in your 20s or 30s, for instance, the correction we’re experiencing is a great opportunity. Why? Because you have the luxury of time on your side. With the market currently down significantly from where it was a year ago, this is a great time to implement a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=fed&amp;utm_campaign=dollar%20cost%20averaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dollar cost averaging</a> strategy and start saving and investing on a consistent basis.</p>\n<p>One of the things that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=fed&amp;utm_campaign=red%20pill%20or%20blue%20pill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">differentiates us at Sherman Wealth</a>, however, is that we believe that no two people are alike and that everyone’s investment strategy and portfolio should be customized to suit his or her individual situation, needs, and goals. We get to know each client – or potential client &#8211; so we can analyze their actual risk tolerance in a holistic way, rather than just plugging their age and one or two other factors into a simple, one-size-fits all algorithm the way some of the Robo-Advisor platforms do. Then we create a plan that is designed to work for our clients.</p>\n<p>I can’t tell you what the market is going to do tomorrow or six months from now – no one can. But with a well-thought-out financial plan &#8211; one that takes into consideration who you are now, where you want to be, and how much risk you can tolerate &#8211; you will feel much more confident about your own strategy and less likely to panic about what the next crazy pundit to pop up on the internet has to say.</p>\n<h6>Photo Source: AP</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

If you&#8217;re gluten-free, that means having a pantry already stocked with gluten-free pasta and a gluten-free loaf of bread in the freezer &#8211; not to mention beans, rice and tomato sauce &#8211; to tide you through the blizzard. It also means sticking to what you know has made sense for you in the past and realizing that two days without bread is not the end of the world &#8211; the bread will return to the shelves once the storm has passed.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if you know your risk tolerance and have already planned effectively, you&#8217;ll have a balanced portfolio that contains the right balance of stocks and other less volatile instruments <em>before</em> a storm hits. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-valeant-dilemma-how-diversified-is-your-diversification/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=gluten-free%20blog&amp;utm_campaign=diversification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">With a fully diversified asset allocation strategy,</a> there will be parts of your portfolio that go up, as well as other parts that go down, during times of stress. That way you&#8217;ll be comfortable sticking to your investment strategy and plan when the market is stormy. Plus, you&#8217;ll have purchased those less volatile instruments before pundits start shouting and everyone starts panic-purchasing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=gluten-free%20blog&amp;utm_campaign=red%20pill%20or%20blue%20pill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A good financial advisor will help you build a portfolio strategy</a> that truly for reflects your risk tolerance and, importantly, helps you understand <em>exactly where the risk is </em>in your portfolio. Your advisor will help you understand if, when and <em>why</em> to own bonds, Munis, Treasuries, and CDs, and how much of a cash component makes sense for your particular situation and need for liquidity.<strong><br />\n</strong><br />\nThe volatility we’re experiencing, current geopolitical uncertainty (like Japanese negative interest rates), and Federal Reserve uncertainty are all great litmus tests to determine whether you have a properly diversified portfolio and whether or not it&#8217;s an accurate match for your true risk tolerance.  If current market conditions or any paper losses you may be experiencing make you feel uncomfortable &#8211; or keeps you up at night &#8211; it&#8217;s likely that your investment strategy does <em>not</em> match your actual risk tolerance and needs to be re-balanced.</p>\n<p>If, however, you&#8217;ve worked with your financial advisor and are comfortable with where you, then you’re best bet is probably to ignore the noise, ignore the panicking pundits, and stick to your saving and investing plan. Remember, if your investments made sense to you a couple of weeks ago, they probably continue to make sense for you, even during market volatility.</p>\n<p>Just like a diversified pantry will help you stick to your nutritional goals when there&#8217;s a run on the supermarket, a good fee-only financial advisor can help you create a portfolio that is truly diversified, risk appropriate, and with the exact amount of liquidity that makes sense for your long-term goals, so you can sit back and weather the storm with confidence.</p>\n<h6>Photo Source: Reuters/Shannon Stapleton</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Are you wondering – given the rate increase and current market turmoil – if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now?</p>\n<p>Actually, the exact opposite happened. Rates actually fell from 2.3% to 1.55% on the US 10-year treasuries (a common indicator of how mortgage rates are priced), their lowest point since September 2012. If you already own a home with an ARM or 30-year fixed mortgage, this is also a good time to refinance or reduce debt at these low rates.</p>\n<p>Remember a house or condo is both a home <u>and</u> an asset that can appreciate over time. No matter what they’re saying on the news, what’s important is what makes sense for <em>your</em> finances, based on <em>your</em> goals and what’s happening in your local housing market.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things to consider:</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate your current circumstances: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would your mortgage payment be in relation to current rent? A good rent-versus-buy calculator can be found at <strong><a href=\"http://realtor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Realtor.com</a></strong></li>\n<li>Do you plan to be in the area for 5 years or more? The housing market will fluctuate. If you need to sell quickly, you may have to sell for less than desired, whereas a booming market can provide quick sales for a profit.</li>\n<li>Can you afford the additional costs? The cost of home ownership is more than just the mortgage payment. There are taxes, insurance and sometimes homeowner’s dues that need to be considered, not to mention upkeep, repairs, upgrades, and furniture!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assess Your Finances:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a good understanding of what your assets and liabilities are.</li>\n<li>Consider what you can afford. Being house poor and unable to save for emergencies, retirement, college or other financial goals can create a stressful situation.</li>\n<li>Speak with a lender about which programs you may qualify for; what a lender will approve you for and how much you can afford may not be the same thing.</li>\n<li>Take a look at your credit report. <strong><a href=\"http://Annualcreditreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a></strong> offers a free credit report from all three credit bureaus. Get one from each bureau and check it for accuracy.</li>\n<li>Meet with a financial advisor to strategize your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\"><strong>financial planning</strong></a> Is it better to make a higher down payment, pay down debt to get your debt to income ratios lower? Or is it better to leave the money invested so the lender includes this in your financial reserves?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Get Pre-approval:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your chosen lender will review your financial information and credit, then make an assessment about how much home you can buy, what down payment is required, and the best loan program. The lender then provides a preapproval letter.</li>\n<li>A second option is having an underwriter review your completed file, evaluating your income, credit, and financial assets, then providing a pre-approval letter.   Having an underwriter review your file may require application fees and other costs to be paid up front.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contact a real estate agent:</strong></p>\n<p>Start your search online to help narrow down location and potential neighborhoods. This can save time (and therefore money) by giving you a sense of where you want to live and what is available in your price range.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay attention above all to location: be sure you are within an acceptable commute to work, schools and other activities that you will be involved in on a regular basis.</li>\n<li>Consider resale value: do not buy the most expensive home in the neighborhood.</li>\n<li>Consider how you want to use your financial resources: fixer-uppers are the best bargains but take both cash and time to complete.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Buying a home is an exciting decision and can result in a solid investment that appreciates over time. Whether or not this is the right moment to purchase is something you should evaluate carefully with your financial advisor, based on your current financial plan and your long-term goals, not based on the news or economic “predictions.”</p>\n<p>While interest rates may have risen slightly they are still at historic lows, so don’t miss out the opportunities that a low-interest rate environment offers homeowners and prospective homeowners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You may have to postpone that fantasy of buying a private island in Thailand, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still be on your way to achieving your financial goals and dreams.</p>\n<p>Here’s one way to do it – take that money you&#8217;re sinking into lottery tickets and invest it instead.</p>\n<p>Why are so many people willing to waste hundreds of dollars on a lottery they won&#8217;t win instead of investing it in capital markets that have shown growth over time? Many reasons. For some people, the hardest part of saving and investing could be just getting started. For others, it&#8217;s not understanding the benefits of compound interest and that even small amounts add up over time. For others it may be fear of volatility and distrust or the markets from listening to too much CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg!</p>\n<p>While it’s true that markets have dipped significantly in January, market dips are a potential opportunity to buy low and earn higher returns over time. The bottom line is that, for most people, even those starting with modest amounts, keeping money in cash is generally <a href=\"http://cramersshirt.weebly.com/blog/cash-is-king-in-your-401k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not a winning proposition</a>.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p>Lets say you are contributing $250 each month ($3k/yr) to your 401k plan with a 100% company match and invest it in a diversified basket of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. At the same time, you save and invest $20 a week (the cost of 10 Powerball tickets a week) in a regular investment account. Assuming historical 4.8% annual returns*, here is how your money will grow over a 20-year period (in today’s dollars) vs. saving the same amount as cash:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2775 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1.png\" alt=\"Picture1\" width=\"853\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1.png 853w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1-300x180.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1-768x460.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" /></a></p>\n<h6>*based on a diversified portfolio that assumes the following weights: 25% in the S&amp;P 500, 10% in the Russell 2000, 15% in the MSCI EAFE, 5% in the MSCI EME, 25% in the Barclays Aggregate, 5% in the Barclays 1-3m Treasury, 5% in the Barclays Global High Yield Index, 5% in the Bloomberg Commodity Index and 5% in the NA REIT Equity REIT Index.

But first speak with a financial advisor about your current situation and future goals and what the best steps are to start working towards financial freedom.</p>\n<p>And when the next Powerball comes around?

Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades.</p>\n<p>As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first time investors, it has also inspired a new breed of smaller independent RIAs, like Sherman Wealth Management (“SWM”), as well as the the new &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221; firms.</p>\n<p>Younger, breakaway firms like SWM aren’t looking for “efficiencies” or working for sales commissions on the products we recommend.

By the time Wells Fargo and the other firms with traditional models get around to investing their time and attention in younger investors, it may just be too late.

No matter how careful you’ve been all year, it’s tempting to splurge on some of the things that make us happiest: good times with friends and family, travel, entertaining, and generous gift-giving to friends, loved ones, and favorite charities.</p>\n<p>Here are 9 end of year tips to help make sure you’re still on target with budget and strategy and help keep important goals in mind if you’re tempted to go over budget during the holidays.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review your budget:</strong> See where you can scrimp a little so you have more to spend on holiday fun. Bring lunch to work, skip bottled water or sodas, or take public transportation, for instance and use the money for holiday treats, travel, or gifting. Seeing where you can cut spending may give you some ideas about how to live more frugally in 2016 so you can pay down debt faster or increase your savings significantly.</li>\n<li><strong>Max out your 401K:</strong> Before the end of the year, take full advantage of your company’s matching program. Those matching funds are the gift that keeps giving through the power of compound interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Use your Flexible Spending Account:</strong> If you have a flex account for healthcare, transportation, or dependent care, try to use your yearly allowance before the end of the year. Cash in on that new pair of glasses you’ve been wanting. If you didn’t use it all – or if you’d already spent it all by May – rethink what you should set aside next year.</li>\n<li><strong>Take a look at this year’s tax refund:</strong> Decide if it makes sense to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\">reduce how much is withheld</a> from each paycheck. By reducing your withholding you’ll have more money in 2016 for investments, savings, and next year’s holiday spending, instead of lending it, interest-free, to Uncle Sam.</li>\n<li><strong>Talk to your financial advisor:</strong> Whether having a conversation about converting from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA or what to declare next year on your taxes, the end of the year is the right time to make new financial decisions. Your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/top-10-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">financial advisor</a> can also help you determine if you have assets that are either above or below your target allocation. If you’re selling at a loss, you can take advantage of a tax write-off!</li>\n<li><strong>Review your insurance policies:</strong> Review any changes in your circumstance or property to make sure you have the right amount of coverage for all contingencies. At the same time, make sure you’re not over-paying for coverage you no longer need.</li>\n<li><strong>Give to your family:</strong> You can give up to $14,000 each to family members with no gift tax or reporting requirements, and the recipient doesn’t pay any tax either.</li>\n<li><strong>Give to charity:</strong> Before the end of the year, charitable donations are not only a great way to express your values, they are also a good way to increase your itemized deductions.</li>\n<li><strong>Save for the kids:</strong> Consider giving children or grandchildren an investment in their future and a first lesson in investing by contributing money to a 529 College Saving Plan! They can use the extra dollars tax-free for college tuition, room and board, and you get a state income tax deduction for your contribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it’s better to give than receive, don’t leave any free money or tax advantages on the table! Review your budget and see if you can add a line item for next year’s holidays so that December 2016 will be the happiest and most stress-free holiday season ever.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Read these tips before you start Googling timeshares in Cancun</strong></h4>\n<p>If you’ve got an end-of-year bonus or a well-deserved raise coming, it’s easy to think of it as “extra money” you can use to splurge on a trip to Mexico, a new phone, or a serious visit to the outlet stores. It’s particularly easy if you’ve been sticking to your budget and feel you deserve a little fun after behaving so responsibly all year!</p>\n<p>Before you blow that bonus on a phone upgrade or a cruise, though, consider these smart ways to really reward yourself with the extra infusion of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Upgrade Your Budget Instead of Your Phone</strong></p>\n<p>Still rocking a flip phone from the 90s? If so, yes, maybe you should invest in something smarter. But for most of us, it’s smarter to spread the extra cash across several budget items. Go ahead and add a little to your entertainment or entertaining budget, but consider allocating the rest of it to these smart ideas!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Make a Bigger Dent in your Debt</strong></p>\n<p>Are you feeling the weight of college loans, a mortgage, or, even worse, high interest credit card debt? You can lighten that load by using your bonus to make a larger payment than usual. It lowers your balance so it reduces some of those high interest charges moving forward. Increasing this budget category when you get that raise can also add up to a significant reduction of interest in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Invest to Watch it Grow</strong></p>\n<p>Setting aside money when you have large expenses to deal with <em>now</em> can be daunting. But the earlier you start investing the more time your money has to grow. If you haven’t already, create an investment account and put that bonus money to work for you, instead of leaving it in a checking account.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Kickstart Retiring</strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve kicked your tires and they need to be replaced, by all means, safety first! Use some of the rest of the money, though, to max out your company’s 401(k) contribution limits. If you qualify for an employer match, your bonus just got bigger!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Recalibrate Your Portfolios</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re already an investor, consider adding some of those extra funds to your investment portfolios. While you’re at it, take a look and see what’s working and what’s not.<strong> </strong>Your financial advisor can help you evaluate whether your allocations should be adjusted based on your risk tolerance and your long and short-term financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Start a College Savings Plan </strong></p>\n<p>It’s never too early to start saving for a child’s college education. By starting early, you can get a good head start and maximize compounded interest. Your financial advisor can help you choose a plan that works with your life, you goals your timeline, and, most importantly, your bonus!</p>\n<p><strong>7. Save for a Rainy Day</strong></p>\n<p>Those emergency funds may seem like low priority, until you suddenly need them. If you haven’t already, create an account with funds for unexepected expenses like job loss, emergency repairs, medical bills for you, your family, or your pets, and even weather emergencies (remember Hurricane Sandy?) A good rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses saved up just in case.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with treating yourself a little. You worked hard and you deserve it! Remember though, that by keeping the splurging and celebrating to a minimum, and letting that bonus or raise work for you, chances are you’ll have much more to celebrate when next year’s bonus comes around!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

But they weren’t alone. Many well-respected funds, including the mighty <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/valeant-holder-sequoia-fund-sees-98-9-million-in-outflows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequoia Fund</a>, and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman&#8217;s <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/25/valeant-bill-ackman-hedge-funds-losses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pershing Capital</a> also had extensive exposure to long time Wall Street darling Valeant and suffered losses not only of value – but of face as well.</p>\n<p>The dramatic losses came as quite a shock to many of the investors who own these &#8211; and other affected &#8211; funds, and <strong>who assumed that the funds were diversified</strong> – when in fact they weren’t. By going out on a limb and investing too much of their allocation in what has been one of Wall Street’s hottest stocks for years, many respected “hedge” funds experienced huge capital losses that it will take years to recover from.</p>\n<p>In fact, of the 1,000 hedge funds tracked by Symmetric.IO, approximately 12% had a position in Valeant. A startling 32% of Valeant’s shares were held by hedge funds.</p>\n<p><strong>When Diversification isn’t Diversification</strong></p>\n<p>Having 20% of your portfolio in one stock is a huge risk for anyone. You never know when the next Enron or Worldcom may be and, because of accusations of unorthodox practices, it may very well be Valeant.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Valeant could still turn out to be a home run and deliver big time. No one really knows, which is why diversification is so key.</p>\n<p>Many investors diversify with ETFs and mutual funds. But how many investors are absolutely certain that the mutual funds they are counting on to provide diversification, are, in fact, properly diversified themselves?</p>\n<p><strong>When that Hot Stock is Too Much of a Good Thing<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>When a “hot stock” or fund keeps climbing, it’s tempting to want to jump on the bandwagon, and the same is true for a hot sector. That’s no doubt why so many otherwise experienced fund managers over-exposed themselves to Valeant and to the health sector in general.</p>\n<p>But while a portfolio with correlated assets that tend to do well together, is also a portfolio with assets that can tend to do poorly together when the winds shift. As Ben Carlson put it in a recent <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/how-much-diversification-is-necessary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a>: “Diversification requires finding the right balance between eliminating unsystematic risk (risk that’s specific to single securities or industries) and di-worsification by adding too many overlapping funds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Put another way: it’s not enough to put your eggs in different baskets, the eggs themselves need to be diversified, some plain, some speckled, and the speckled ones should be speckled in different ways.</p>\n<p>A properly diversified mutual fund or ETF allow you to invest in a sector or a “hot stock” while mitigating risk. Which is no doubt what the investors who held Tiger, Pershing, and Sequoia thought they were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>The Moral of the Story</strong></p>\n<p>Due diligence. While you and your financial advisor are most likely diversifying your holdings, make sure that your holdings are also diversifying <u>their</u> holdings. Review your mutual funds frequently to make sure that their strategies, risk tolerance, and diversification standards align with yours and that they are not over-weighted chasing impressive returns from a couple of current wall street darlings.</p>\n<p>The jury is still out on Valeant and on the funds that held it. It may in fact recover, although it would have to recover quickly to make up for the loss of momentum for the funds and investors that held it.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’s an important lesson for individual investors. A truly diversified portfolio is made up of truly diversified assets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">****</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This analysis is provided for informational purposes only and is not to be considered investment advice.

You’ve turned your money over to a mysterious series of algorithms with no human in sight to help you guide it.</p>\n<p>Many investors – particularly younger ones – are also put off by the idea of bespoke-suited advisors from traditional firms who are trying to up-sell them investments and insurance products with hefty fees and commissions. And even if they were to opt for the more conservative “blue pill,” traditional advisories are often not interested in speaking with them because they can’t make the hefty minimum investment.</p>\n<p>While there is some truth to both stereotypes, there are also<strong> big shifts</strong> going on in the financial industry that make this a great time to take advantage of both a new breed of independent financial advisor and the efficiencies that targeted robo-platforms can provide.</p>\n<p>Here are the differences – as well as drawbacks and benefits &#8211; in a nutshell:</p>\n<p><strong>Robo Advisors:</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive compared to full-service portfolio management</li>\n<li>Lower barrier to entry: lower initial investment requirements</li>\n<li>Democratic: all clients benefit equally from algorithmic decisions, not just the big investors</li>\n<li>Data-driven: driven by numbers, trends, and deep data – not emotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited scope: robo advisor only handle investment management, not comprehensive financial planning</li>\n<li>Generic: they categorize you using broad-stroke demographic – not individualized- goal and risk-tolerance profiling to build your portfolio</li>\n<li>Automatic: selling or “rebalancing” can be triggered by pre-set formulas at times that you might be wiser to stay put</li>\n<li>Limited opportunities: many robo-firms currently have a limited or “preferred” set of funds and options you can invest in</li>\n<li>Impersonal: no human interaction for questions regarding your individual investment portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Traditional Financial Advisory Firms</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone who picks up the phone when you call or will see you when you make an appointment.</li>\n<li>Flexible: can make real-time decisions about what’s right for you or when to buy or sell not rather than being locked into formulas.</li>\n<li>Multi-layers of expertise to call on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier to entry: many traditional advisories have high minimums and confusing requirements and may only offer enhanced services to “premium” clients</li>\n<li>Conflict of interest: many advisories have a “corporate agenda” to promote certain products, or they follow a [Suitability Standard] that doesn’t necessarily put the clients’ interests above their own</li>\n<li>Change resistant: larger organizations can be “too big for their own good,” and slow to incorporate new tech or new processes that add value for their clients or address clients’ individual needs.</li>\n<li>Limited customization: established firms frequently use old-school models of demographics, risk allocation, and target dates without factoring in what makes each client unique</li>\n<li>Impersonal: while customer service is available, traditional firms often don’t truly “meet you where you are” and customize services and portfolios for you unless you have a large portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Enter the New Breed</strong></p>\n<p>A growing number of independent financial advisors are disrupting the traditional model and starting to create a “third way,” <strong>hybrid advisories</strong> that strive to offer all the pros and – hopefully &#8211; none of the cons. They offer clients customized fee-only services – unhindered by corporate agendas &#8211; and with a lower minimum investment. At the same time they are able to incorporate the newest tech tools that not only make it easy for new clients to get started, but also offer fast, best-in-class investment management modeling to make faster decisions about managing investments.</p>\n<p>Or, as Josh Brown so eloquently put it in <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2015/10/18/the-ballad-of-the-breakaway-broker/\">a recent blog post</a>, “…innovation and creative spirit is fleeing from the Old World to the new one.”</p>\n<p>So why haven’t all advisors embraced the new technology to offer enhanced services to their clients? The three biggest reasons are inertia, inertia, and inertia. It’s not easy to change entrenched business models, culture, and processes. Remember how Netflix caught the video rental business napping?</p>\n<p><strong>Why Not Just Go with a Robo Advisor?</strong></p>\n<p>Robo advisors generally only offer investment management, not comprehensive, goal-oriented financial planning. While both investment advisors and robo advisors can recommend investment direction, strategy, and allocation, a good financial advisor can help you identify goals, customize budgets and cash flow planning, and help you with insurance, credit, and debt management, things a robo-platform can’t do.</p>\n<p>The most important thing about the integration of new tech with personal attention and a customized plan is that a user-friendly tech interface can allow clients to manage all the pieces of their financial plans, from cash flow to 401Ks, while allowing an experienced advisor to monitor it and give clients a call when that advisor sees an opportunity, a red flag, or wants to check in about goals and direction.</p>\n<p>These days, clients can see through the bespoke suits; what they’re looking for is bespoke service. By embracing selected and appropriate technology, this new breed of independent financial advisors are able to offer all the “pros,” while creating a new model of more transparent, conflict-free financial management that’s available to everyone who wants to set – an achieve – financial goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>When you hear the words Robo Advisors, what do you think of&#8230;?

But having a financial advisor who is making recommendations primarily based on your age and risk tolerance – and who could be putting their own, or their company’s, financial interests ahead of your interests &#8212; could be disastrous for your financial future.</p>\n<p>Instead, the <strong>Fiduciary Standard</strong>, which is the standard for registered investment advisors under state and federal regulations, requires that <span style=\"color: #000066;\">a </span>financial advisor act <strong>solely</strong> in a client’s best interest when offering financial advice.</p>\n<p><strong>Registered Investment Advisors</strong> &#8211; like Sherman Wealth Management &#8211; must follow &#8211; and are held to &#8211; the <strong>Fiduciary Standard.</strong> That means that a RIA must put their client’s needs ahead of their own, provide fully-disclosed, conflict-free advice, be fully transparent about fees, and continue to monitor a client’s investments, as well as their changing financial situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s a potential scenario that illustrates the differences</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say your broker-dealer has three possible funds to recommend to you. The first is a “suitable” index fund, offered by her own company, which pays her a 6% commission on the sale and charges a 2% annual fee. The second is a similarly suitable index fund that would pay her a 3% commission on the sale and has a 1% annual fee. The third is an index fund that has no sales commission and an annual fee of .5%. Under the Suitability Standard, she can recommend the higher priced fund and still satisfy the standard. Under the Fiduciary Standard, she would be required to recommend the third fund.</p>\n<p>This is not to suggest that broker-dealers or others operating under the Suitability Standard don’t look out for their clients.  While many reps who follow the Suitability Standard give their clients excellent advice, they operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest.</p>\n<p>So go ahead and let the waiter talk you into that chocolate cake (even though you know you’ll feel better tomorrow if you have the strawberries.)

Not necessarily: the oldest lesson on Wall Street is that everything is easy in hindsight.</p>\n<p>While highly speculative, those numbers do highlight the ongoing debate over which is a better investment – real estate instruments or stocks. Both stocks have and the real estate market have had great runs in recent history and, depending on when you invested, you could make cases for both investments being the better choice.</p>\n<p>But the stock market and the real estate market both experience volatility, dips, and extended recovery times so, for the average investor, a portfolio composed of mainly real estate or other fixed assets (like art or collectibles, for instance) poses some risks that should be hedged with proper cash flow planning, a diversified portfolio, and proper tax planning.</p>\n<p><strong>Cash Flow Planning</strong></p>\n<p>A good financial plan takes into account how much cash you need access to, or may need access to in the future. Cash flow planning should be a key factor in deciding whether real estate investments are part your individualized financial strategy.</p>\n<p>As National Journal points out, Trump claims he is willing to spend upwards of $1 billion of his own money to fund his presidential campaign, yet his financial disclosure statements show that he may have less than $200 million in cash, stocks, and bonds. The rest of his fortune is tied up in real estate investments, which could be much harder to liquidate and use for his campaign.</p>\n<p>Most of us aren’t running for president but, if something like the 2007 housing collapse were to happen again, any investor who is predominantly invested in real estate could have problems liquidating those – diminished &#8211; assets for retirement, college funding, or other non-presidential goals.</p>\n<p>A solution: diversification.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you are investing in real estate or the stock market, diversification is always a prudent way to address your own risk tolerance and use proper foresight in creating a winning strategy.</p>\n<p>While with real estate funds, diversification can be achieved via many factors, including residential vs commercial investments, differing location focuses, and differing interest rates and financing mechanisms, it is still fundamentally one sector, subject to sentiment and swings.</p>\n<p>With the stock market, on the other hand, diversification allows you the opportunity to invest not only in different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and money market funds, but in a variety of sectors and industries as well. Over the past 60 years, historically, the stock market has averaged an <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp#sthash.TXk7awA7.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8% annual return</a>, so investors with strategically balanced and diversified portfolios, there is the opportunity for steady, while not spectacular gains, with the potential for less risk than investing only in the real estate market.</p>\n<p>An investor who is properly diversified through multiple asset classes – including real estate if it makes sense for their own customized strategy – is potentially better protected against the short term results of one asset class experiencing a crash or a prolonged dip.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is that options for investing in real estate in IRAs and other tax-deferred accounts are complicated and not every custodian will allow you to include real estate investments in a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/self-directed-real-estate-iras.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax-deferred account</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hindsight vs Foresight</strong></p>\n<p>While Donald Trump is an outlier because his high net worth shelters him from some of the issues with primarily being invested in real estate, it’s intriguing to consider “what if.”</p>\n<p>In the case of a more typical investor, a little foresight can go a long way in making sure you are on your way to achieving your own financial goals. A sound financial plan should be tailored to individual goals and cash flow needs, with a customized cash flow plan, and diversified across multiple asset classes for the potential for steady and compounded growth over time.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a Donald Trump with a large inheritance or a young professional just getting started, a solid plan and strategy puts the benefit of hindsight where it belongs: in a conversation over coffee or cocktails, and not as the basis for a winning investment strategy.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Donald Trump’s current net worth – as he would be the first to tell you &#8211; is estimated to be between $2 and $4 billion, most of which he made through inheritance and real estate investments, along with other business dealings.

But, historically, the S&amp;P 500 averaged a <span class=\"__postbox-detected-content __postbox-detected-date\"><span class=\"__postbox-detected-content __postbox-detected-date\">7-8%</span></span> return (after inflation)* each year and that’s value you’re missing out on if you’re not invested.</p>\n<p><em> “The only &#8220;people&#8221; who can react to those pricing distortions in real time are computers.

And this season, as in previous ones, fans will be wondering why some fantasy team managers just seem to have a knack for finding those sleepers and high upside players, while other managers routinely fail to understand and predict player value.</p>\n<p>Investors often wonder the same thing: why do some investors consistently get it right and prosper, while others are lucky if they even break even?</p>\n<p>Coincidence? Maybe, but there are several important things successful fantasy football managers have in common with successful real-life investors.</p>\n<p>Here are three important mindsets that can help you go the whole 9 yards, whether it’s on the virtual gridiron or with your own financial plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Research the Players</strong></p>\n<p>A good fantasy football manager knows that you need to study all the different variables &#8211; including roster positions, draft picks, and expected performance – to build a winning team. Understanding the available options is critical to determining things like how many players you need at each position and which players you think will be the best.</p>\n<p>This same principal applies to investing. A smart investor or financial advisor starts by understanding all the different variables, such as capital, types of investments, and asset classes. Understanding the pros and cons of various investment strategies is critical in determining how to choose a strategy that is the appropriate option for your own goals and needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Never count on a couple of stars to carry the team</strong></p>\n<p>When drafting your fantasy team, you always want to diversify your risk. You might not want to draft multiple offense players from the Green Bay Packers, for instance, even if that team is loaded with talent, because, if Aaron Rodgers and company have a bad week, your fantasy team will be struggling too. Smart fantasy managers build a stable foundation and don’t just count on rising stars.</p>\n<p>When building your investment portfolio, risk diversification is critical as well. Wall Street is littered with stories of investors who put all their eggs in one “sure” basket, only to learn the lesson of diversification the hard way. Even if you’re extremely confident that a certain sector is a good bet, it’s usually better to diversify and limit your amount of exposure to individual sectors. That way, even if the sector doesn’t do as well as you had anticipated, your investments are distributed across other asset classes, and your risk should be better managed.</p>\n<p><strong>When the going gets tough, the tough stay disciplined</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who has played fantasy football knows the danger of making a snap waiver wire decision you’ll regret later. On one hand, you don’t want to panic and drop your star player after a rough few weeks, only to see him rebound to a MVP-caliber season (and on someone else’s team!) On the other hand, just because an unproven player has a great week doesn’t mean he’s more valuable than the player you’d have to drop in order to acquire him.</p>\n<p>When the market hits a volatile patch, it takes a disciplined investor to trust their plan and avoid making snap decisions about buying and selling. A look at the history of the stock market makes it abundantly clear that investors who take a long term view do better than those who shift their investment strategies with every changing wind. This doesn’t mean that any plan should be viewed as foolproof; a good investor or financial advisor knows the value of reassessing and recalibrating appropriately and strategically. What it does mean is that, when the going gets tough, a prudent investor takes the long view, stays disciplined, and sticks to a strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s a long season</strong></p>\n<p>The only NFL team in history to have an undefeated season is the Miami Dolphins who finished 17-0 in the shorter 1972 season. No NFL team has gone 19-0 to date so it’s highly unlikely that any fantasy team will achieve perfection either. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have a great season and get smarter and smarter about putting together a winning team.</p>\n<p>With investing too, there will always be ups and downs, touchdowns and penalties, fumbles and conversions, and a few Hail Mary’s. But with a solid game plan and clearly defined goal, you’ll be on your way to a putting together a strategy designed to stand the test of time and put you squarely where you want to be: heading toward your own end zone with your eye on the ball and your own goals in sight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1304073-091715</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>As the NFL season begins, millions of fantasy football fans are busy researching and drafting their teams.

If a 2-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny circumference. As it keeps rolling, its surface grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution.</p>\n<p>If you invest $1000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2158.93, in 20 years that will be $4660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. All it takes is patience to turn $1000 &#8211; the price of one ski weekend &#8211; into $21,724.52.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to start saving early.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1861\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-1024x786.jpg\" alt=\"chart25\" width=\"976\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-1024x786.jpg 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-300x230.jpg 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-768x589.jpg 768w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px\" /></a></p>\n<h5><em>The above chart is hypothetical and assumes an 8% rate of return compounded annually. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any specific investment.   Investment return and principal values will fluctuate so that your investment when redeemed may be worth more or less than its original cost. Rates of return do not include fees and charges, which are inherent to other investment products. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</em></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Volatility &#8211; Market Highs and Lows</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what happens if the market dips and your investment loses value?</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong> &#8211; when market value fluctuates up and down – can be an opportunity for disciplined savers who contribute regularly to their investments, regardless of share price. When prices are low, you’re able to buy more shares. When prices are high you’re able to buy fewer shares for the same amount but those shares earn more interest, which is called Dollar Cost Averaging (<em>Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.</em>)</p>\n<p>Imagine that snowball again, rolling down a hill, acquiring more and more snow as it goes. What happens when it hits a bare patch with no snow? Often it picks up rocks and pebbles, which add even more surface volume. So, when it hits the snow again, it picks up even more because it’s larger.</p>\n<p>That’s how compound interest, coupled with regular investments, may work too: the “rough patches” produce more volume, which then allows you to acquire more compounded interest. So if you buy more shares during a dip, when the market recovers you could hypothetically not only earn compound interest on more shares, you earn more interest. So long as the price of your particular investment recovers, of course.</p>\n<p>As Josh Brown points out in his recent blog post about Warren Buffett and David Tepper, both these legendary investors have gotten to where they are today because they’ve successfully ridden out volatility. In 1998 Warren Buffets own Berkshire Hathaway’s “A” shares had dropped in price from approximately $80,000 to $59,000 but Buffet didn’t sell. Those shares just hit a high of $229,000 this year.</p>\n<p>If you see volatility &#8211; like what we experienced in August &#8211; as a tool and keep contributing regularly to your investments, you’ll potentially maximize the effect of compounded interest and watch your investments snowball over time!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1174145-041515</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>******</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additional Reading:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HopNTVEJvn\"><p><a href=\"https://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/13/how-two-of-historys-greatest-investors-deal-with-losses/\">How two of history&#8217;s greatest investors deal with losses</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;How two of history&#8217;s greatest investors deal with losses&#8221; &#8212; The Reformed Broker\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/13/how-two-of-historys-greatest-investors-deal-with-losses/embed/#?secret=HopNTVEJvn\" data-secret=\"HopNTVEJvn\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>http://awealthofcommonsense.com/did-investors-just-experience-the-best-risk-adjusted-returns-ever/</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator\">http://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Compound interest is, simply put, the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment has already earned.

That means that, while not panicking, most Millennials may have been missing one of the biggest potential opportunities of the past 10 years.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Aren’t Millennials Investing?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are many theories –from Millennials being shell-shocked by experiencing their families’ anxiety in 2008, to YOLO, the feeling that it’s better to spend and enjoy the money now because who knows what the future may bring. The problem is that the future is likely to bring a whole lot fewer opportunities if you haven’t planned properly!</p>\n<h3><strong>Are You Even Beating Inflation? </strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s say hypothetically that the stock market may rebound by 5%&#8230; Simple, common sense math shows that keeping your money in the bank at .05% interest means it would take you 100 years to make the same amount of money that investing it now could. And the cash you are saving under the mattress or in one of your vintage vinyl sleeves? That money is just losing value every second you leave it there, as the cost of blankets and concert tickets continues to climb with inflation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Risk, Volatility, and Paper Losses</strong></h3>\n<p>It’s important to know the difference between risk and volatility and many people get it wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong> – stock prices moving up and down – is a normal part of the stock market <u>and</u> an opportunity for a disciplined saver to buy when the market is both up and down. When you have a solid plan in place you can capitalize on market price dislocations, like what happened this week. <strong>Risk</strong> is how likely you are to lose it all and it’s important to remember – while everyone has their own risk tolerance – price corrections and market volatility does not necessarily mean you are going to lose it all. As the chart below borrowed from The Irrelevant Investor’s <a href=\"https://theirrelevantinvestor.wordpress.com/2015/08/24/should-investors-stay-the-course/#more-1843\">excellent post</a> on staying the course shows, the stock market has historically climbed in spite of dips. And <strong>paper losses</strong> are just that: it’s not real loss if you don’t sell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1819\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png\" alt=\"stock market drops\" width=\"640\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png 640w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1-300x203.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As this chart by Deutsche Bank’s <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.in/There-are-2-big-problems-with-blaming-China-for-the-stock-market-sell-off/articleshow/48670991.cms\">Torsten Slok</a> shows, in spite of other times of great volatility, markets have always recovered.

The big companies aren’t interested in smaller investors with less than <a href=\"http://www.wealthprofessional.ca/news/mega-firm-cuts-small-accounts-194854.aspx\">250-500K</a> and the robo solutions don’t understand what makes each smaller investor’s situation unique. There’s a whole new breed of financial advisors, however, who combine personalized service with targeted tech solutions for smaller investors. So no excuses &#8211; there are financial pros ready help you create an investment strategy that makes sense for your personal goals and financial situation. And volatility doesn’t disrupt what we do!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’ve got a solid financial plan, investing in the stock market does not affect your ability to pay your rent, take care of yourself or your family, or add to that rainy day emergency fund. The money you’re saving and investing is money that you’ve determined <em>you don’t need now</em>, it’s money you have set aside for the long haul. Assuming your planner has planned correctly, you’re not going to miss your car payment because the Chinese stock market is crashing.</p>\n<p>And that huge correction that scared you in 2008? It eventually rebounded and the market continued to climb. As a Millennial you’ve got years on your side if you start investing now.

From scouring the finance blogs and Twitter for the latest “surefire” ways to beat the market, to diagnosing our aches on WebMD, to grilling along with Bobby Flay on YouTube, it can seem like we have almost instant access to the same information as the pros.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to personal finances, why is it necessary to have a financial advisor when financial news is so readily available, Twitter is flooded with “hot tips,” robo advisors are ready to automate the whole process for you, and comparison shopping is so easy? Why can’t you just use this treasure trove of information to make your own financial decisions? Or subscribe to an algorithm-based service that will make the best lightning-quick decisions for you?</p>\n<p>A couple of reasons&#8230;</p>\n<p>If you’re good and you dedicate a lot of time online, you can definitely pick up some great information and strategies that the experts are sharing (follow me on Twitter by clicking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shermanwealth\">here</a>!) The tricky part is making sure that the information and the strategies are actually appropriate for you and appropriate right now. We all know that, if we’re not careful, the instantaneous nature of the internet, social media, and impersonal algorithms can lead to impulsive decisions that may not support our own long-term goals and personal risk profile. Quick reactions to new stock market “darlings” or to sudden market volatility can lead to choices that are not the best for your long &#8211; or even near – term financial health and growth. In fact, there is a whole science called Behavioral Finance that addresses how personal biases can lead investors to make decisions that actually work against the goals they set for themselves.</p>\n<p>A good financial professional is able to sift through the vast amount of information available to you and determine what is significant to your strategy and what may just be a distraction. A financial advisor who understands Behavioral Finance can help you see where your assumptions, habits, and biases about money and investing may be leading you to get in your own way.</p>\n<p>The new algorithm-based platforms are increasingly interesting and have a lot of merit, but the level of personalization is not yet very deep. That means that portfolios are based on broad criteria that may have nothing to do with your current situation, lifestyle, and goals. Again, this is where a trained professional will be able to view your unique individual needs and create a tailored strategy that is geared to you and not just everyone who matches your age and salary level. As more and more fiduciary financial advisors are starting to use smart algorithms as part of their offerings where appropriate, the key is “where appropriate” and “in the clients’ best interest,” the very definition of a fiduciary.</p>\n<p>Think about it: would you rather grill along with Bobby Flay on your iPad or would you rather have regular meetings with Bobby, where he looks at the size and model of your Weber, the size of your shrimp, and the recipes you’re trying to learn, and works with you to make sure you become the master of your own grill? (and shrimp!)</p>\n<p>The same goes for your financial future. While do-it-yourself is getting easier and easier, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s getting better and better. Look for a fiduciary financial advisor who also has access to the latest information online and is familiar with the latest algorithmic innovations, but who uses that information to get to know clients individually, and tailors a long-term growth strategy for them that will put them on the road to achieving the goals they have set for themselves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p>With over a decade’s worth of experience in financial services, Brad Sherman is committed to helping his clients pursue their financial goals.

When you’ve thought through a plan, it’s less likely that panic &#8211; or other “behavioral mistakes” &#8211; will lead you to react in ways you may be regretting for a long time.</p>\n<p>While most investors say they’ll continue to hold on to their investments when there’s a sharp downturn (and many even say that they’ll add money when their investments go down), data tells a far different story. In December 2008, right as the market was near its lowest point, investors pulled out a whopping $10.6 billion from equity mutual funds alone.</p>\n<p>Panicking during market bottoms is a form of “behavioral bias” that can have a devastating effect on financial health. While the S&amp;P 500 has averaged around 10% a year, costly behavioral mistakes cause many individual investors to significantly <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/11621555/1/average-investor-20-year-return-astoundingly-awful.html\">miss those gains.</a> That’s because, despite good advice, people still tend to put money in the stock market as it rises and pull money out as the market falls. The result: many investors buy <a href=\"http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/are-we-buying-high-all-over-again/?scp=1&amp;sq=buy%20low%20stocks&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=1#sthash.kSv3JRiw.dpuf\">at market tops</a> and sell at market bottoms.</p>\n<p>While none of us are immune to behavioral biases, there are several things we can do to help avoid costly mistakes.</p>\n<h3><strong> 1.  Learn From the Past</strong></h3>\n<p>The first step is to understand that market declines are a normal part of investing and resist the urge to panic!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1472\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1472\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://theirrelevantinvestor.tumblr.com/post/113520921728/where-do-stocks-go-from-here-after-six-years-of\"><img class=\"wp-image-1472 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1.jpg\" alt=\"tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540\" width=\"540\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1.jpg 540w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1-300x160.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CRSP 1-10 Index</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While the S&amp;P has historically returned almost 10% annually since the 1960s, those returns are not consistent. One year the market could be up 20% and the next it could decline 12%! To make the ride even bumpier: the market also has streaks where returns decline for several consecutive years. That’s when investors often begin to panic and pull their money out. Unfortunately, that’s usually the worst time to do so, and when investors often should be increasing their investments instead.</p>\n<p>Although the market can move up and down in the course of a year, or several years, it has historically trended upwards over longer periods of time (10 or 20 years.) So if your investment horizon is longer than just a few years, remember that it’s likely the market will <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">recover its losses</a> &#8211; and then some &#8211; over time.</p>\n<p>Understanding that the U.S. stock market bounces back after its declines is a helpful first step in creating “un-biased” financial habits!</p>\n<h3>2.  <strong>Understand that Accepting Lower Returns May be Okay </strong></h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, younger investors have more years ahead of them to invest. That means they are often able to put a higher percentage of their money in stocks and a very low, or even zero, percentage in bonds. How much you allocate to stocks will depend on factors such as your own investment objectives and your ability to tolerate risk.</p>\n<p>If you know that you’re prone to panicking during market declines, however, you may want to keep your portfolio in more conservative investments than your age and investment horizon would normally indicate.</p>\n<p>It’s much better to be a bit more conservative and hold on to your investments during market downturns, than to buy riskier assets and sell during market crashes!</p>\n<h3><strong> 3.  Speak with a Professional</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’re like most Americans, chances are you spend more time researching your next car than researching your investments!</p>\n<p>Investing can be a difficult &#8211; and sometimes dry &#8211; subject. Learning about the history of the stock market, your own risk tolerance, and behavioral biases that can trip you up is challenging for most people and probably something you don’t want to spend a lot of time on.</p>\n<p>That’s where a trusted financial planner can help.</p>\n<p>A good financial planner can help guide you along the path in planning for your own financial goals; explain difficult concepts; help you discover your own risk tolerance; recommend appropriate investments based on those risk tolerances; and help you avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people’s portfolios.</p>\n<p>A good financial planner also understands the history of the market and knows that, while bull markets don’t last forever, declines are generally temporary as well. Knowing that, and having a plan tailored to your specific financial goals will help you to avoid panicking when markets go south, and avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people’s portfolios.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brad Sherman is a financial advisor based in Gaithersburg Maryland who is experienced in understanding both the history of the market, as well as how behavioral biases affect investor returns.

These three simple steps will give your increased focus and will help you move closer to that goal.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve incorporated them in your daily routine, identify a second goal and follow the same plan. The key to success is taking it one step at a time!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy Use Downtime Wisely </strong></h3>\n<p>At the end of your workday, do you like to relax with Netflix, video games, or YouTube? According to Corley’s data, <strong>66%</strong> of the wealthy said that they watch less than an hour of television a day, <strong>63%</strong> spend less than an hour a day on the Internet unless it is job-related, an impressive <strong>79%</strong> say they read career and educational material each day, and an equally impressive <strong>63%</strong> said &#8220;I listen to audio books during the commute to work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While we all like to relax and recharge with entertaining media, that time can never be recovered for things that help you become a stronger, more successful individual like reading, networking, exercising, or volunteering for a cause you believe in.</p>\n<p>Time is the great equalizer: we all have 24 hours a day. What you choose to do with that time can either help you to reach your financial and life goals, or distract you from it, so choose wisely!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy Invest in Their Future </strong></h3>\n<p>Corley’s research also showed that <a href=\"http://www.success.com/article/16-rich-habits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the wealthy live within their means</a>, pay themselves first, and don’t overspend.</p>\n<p>Building wealth is not accomplished by upgrading to each new electronic gadget, leasing the newest model car, and living in an extravagant home. The wealthy, according to Corley, spend less than they earn, own and maintain their cars for many years, and save a significant portion of their income. While saving money and living modestly is not as sexy as a flashy smartphone, it will go a lot further toward providing a comfortable future.</p>\n<p>Living within your means also includes not carrying credit card balances or heavy debt. When you are carrying debt, what you earn today is paying for yesterday’s expenses. Living within your means while saving and investing a portion of your income lets you invest in tomorrow, rather than yesterday, while learning to be satisfied with what you have today.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy are Willing to Take Risks </strong></h3>\n<p>Another fascinating finding of Corley’s research is that<strong> 63%</strong> of the wealthy people he interviewed said they that they had <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ways-rich-people-think-differently-2014-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taken risks</a> in search of wealth, while only 6% of the struggling Americans he interviewed said that they had taken risks.</p>\n<p>For many, fear of failure is a great de-motivator and can be paralyzing. When you do not fully understand something, whether it’s a challenge, a potential project, an investment, or even a social problem, it can be easier to do nothing than to act. But without risk, there is often no reward.</p>\n<p>What Corley discovered is that, instead, rather than fearing failure, the wealthy consider failure to be part of the process and – most importantly &#8211; an opportunity to learn.</p>\n<p>How can you face risk without fear so that you can seize potential opportunities? Educating yourself is the key step. Researching the investment, the project, or the choice, and learning about the options and risks, help keep fear and anxiety about the unknown from clouding your decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Even with the best preparation though, choices don’t turn out as envisioned. When that happens, take a page from the wealthy: learning from those failures and experiences will lead to more opportunities and better choices down the road!</p>\n<h3><strong>Are Your Own Habits Setting You Up for Success?</strong></h3>\n<p>While following each of these habits may not make you rich, they will certainly help you get into a success mind-set. <strong>68%</strong> of the Americans on Forbes billionaire list consider themselves to be “<a href=\"http://www.business-management-degree.net/features/wealthiest-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-made billionaires</a>,” which means that they worked hard to reach their own professional and financial goals. The true route to financial success is through discipline and steady habits that grow your net worth over time.</p>\n<p>Do you already share these four habits of the wealthy? If so, congratulations on your focus and your commitment to success.

Here Are 4 Simple Steps To Get You Started","content":"<p>Close your eyes for a moment and envision where you’d like to be in 30 or 40 years… Are you sailing to Tahiti? Writing that book? Running your vineyard? Building a new company?</p>\n<p>If you had trouble envisioning where you’d like to be, you’re not alone. But unless you can visualize it, unless you’ve got your destination planned, it can be hard to get there. That’s why it’s so important to start thinking about what your goals currently are &#8211; whether it’s for yourself, your career, your startup, your art, and/or your family &#8211; and take the first – or the next – steps to invest in your future.</p>\n<p>What does investing mean? Very simply, it means putting your money somewhere you expect it to grow. It can be traditional stocks, bonds and mutual funds, or real estate, collectibles, annuities, and other things that are expected to gain value over time.</p>\n<p>When you’re just starting out, thinking about &#8211; and setting aside money for &#8211; your future can feel like a challenge; when you&#8217;ve just set up your first lemonade stand and barely breaking even, it’s hard to think about re-investing part of your profits in lemon groves that will someday produce income for you.</p>\n<p>The trick is to overcome inertia, get started, and make a commitment, even if it’s just a tiny first step.</p>\n<h3><strong>Inertia is not your friend</strong></h3>\n<p>Inertia is one of the biggest reasons people waste opportunities to started investing when they’re young.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Objects at rest tend to stay at rest:</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not investing yet, or if your money is sitting in a non-income producing bank account it can be hard to get started or get moving.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Objects in motion tend to stay in motion:</em></strong></p>\n<p>If your money is constantly in motion, if you’re spending everything you make, or if your money is following the crowd to the next big glamour stock, it can be hard to slow down and take stock with a Financial Planner to build a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>A study by Hewitt Associates found, for instance, that only 31% of employees in their 20s invest in their company’s 401K plan¹. That means almost 70% of young employees who could be investing in a matching 401k plan haven’t started taking advantage of what is essentially free money. Whether inertia is keeping them from getting started, or inertia is keeping their money in motion so that there’s none left over to invest, they are not only leaving free money on the table, they’re not letting that money grow through compounding.</p>\n<p>According to an article in US News and World Report, if you start investing just $100 a month in your 20s, increase contributions as your income increases, and make good financial decisions along the way, you are on your way to potentially retiring with over 1 million dollars.²</p>\n<h3><strong>How Do You Get Started?</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are four simple steps to get you past inertia and get you started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find your motivation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are all passionate about certain things. The more you care, the more focused you are about achieving your goals. Make a list of the things that are important to you and the things you want to achieve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find extra money</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are only two ways to “find” money &#8211; spending less or making more. While it may seem daunting – inertia again! – you’d be surprised by how easy it is to discover places you can cut back a little or spend a little less. And, while you have a lot more control over your spending than your earnings, you can also look for ways to find extra sources of income, work more hours, or even get a better paying job.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Move financial goals up</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you plan to save “whatever you have left” or “whatever you’ve saved” at the end of each month, don’t be surprised by how little that actually is. We all have a tendency to spend what we have, and spend more as our income goes up. You can avoid that pitfall by paying yourself first. When you prioritize saving in your budget and take that money “out of circulation,” your spending will fall in line.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get advice from an adviser you trust</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The world of finance and investing can be complicated and confusing. Don’t let fear of the unknown keep you from getting started. You don’t need a large amount of savings to meet with an adviser who can answer a lot of your questions. Getting a roadmap from someone who knows the territory will help you get started and may allow for a smoother journey.</p>\n<p>Investing in your future is an investment in yourself. If you take these four simple steps, even with limited assets, you’ll be laying the foundation for a lifetime of investing in your own plans and goals, and your own vision of financial freedom.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>All investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Putting money into the market when you’re young &#8211; even small amounts &#8211; gives your investments time to grow and compound over time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, too many millennials haven’t gotten started yet. A recent survey by Bankrate found that only 26% of Americans under 30 were invested in the stock market, compared to 58% between the ages of 58 and 64. (1)</p>\n<p>While the stock market has historically seen positive returns over the long run, it’s not hard to understand why many millennials are wary of it. Millennials under 30 have seen two major market crashes: the tech bubble of the late 1990’s as well as the 2008 economic crisis. Many saw how family members and friends lost years worth of savings and were often financially devastated by what happened.</p>\n<p>The result: a deep distrust of Wall Street and a desire to avoid the market altogether.</p>\n<p>While it is understandable that millennials are wary about putting their earnings into the market, it’s also unfortunate.</p>\n<p>In spite of the two crises of 1990 and 2008, if you had invested in the S&amp;P 500 at the beginning of 1985, and kept that money in until the end of 2014, you would have earned over 25 times what you had initially invested. (2) (3)</p>\n<p>Even saving just a small amount each week or month would have made a tremendous difference in your retirement savings.</p>\n<h4><strong><em>The Second Mistake</em></strong></h4>\n<p>While many millennials make the mistake of investing too little in the market, others make another critical mistake. While they may be making regular contributions, they may not be invested in a wide enough variety of securities.</p>\n<p>The youngest generations have grown up with access to the internet, social media, online financial media, and the tools to invest in any publicly traded security that they choose and they feel empowered to make investment decisions on their own, without consulting a professional. They’re also able to trade information with friends and make changes to their portfolio in a matter of seconds using their smartphone or computer.</p>\n<p>Because of this, millennials are often invested in individual hot stocks, companies they believe in, or companies that sell products they use and like. This can (and will) work for some investors sometimes as a result of sheer luck and the law of large numbers, but it is not a consistent – or wise &#8211; strategy to rely on.</p>\n<h4><strong><em>Buying What’s in the News</em></strong></h4>\n<p>In 2007 researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Davis published a paper where they showed that individual investors have a tendency to buy stocks that had recently been in the news, or that had share prices that had recently gone up (4). By buying these “hot” stocks, new investors were forced to bid up the price to a higher level than they were before the news story came out. The study showed that, because these investors were buying at an artificially higher price, their portfolios ended up performing poorly as a result of having bought these ‘hot stocks’.</p>\n<p>Additionally many millennials choose to engage in “socially responsible” investing, avoiding stocks in companies that sell products they don’t believe in, or that engage in business practices they feel are undesirable, and putting their money in companies that they believe in and feel good about.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this too can have a negative impact on their returns over the long run. By focusing so narrowly, their portfolios are missing a major piece of the market, which limits their diversification. Additionally social responsible investments can have higher fees than their non-SRI counterparts, because they have the added cost of screening out stocks based on certain criteria.</p>\n<p>Along with the added costs, and the decrease in diversification that result in focusing only on SRIs, researchers from Princeton and New York University published a paper in 2009 that showed that ‘sin stocks’ have historically outperformed their non-sin counterparts. (5)</p>\n<p>Whether you are choosing to invest your money in a single stock, or several stocks, or you choose to invest in a SRI investment, you are limiting your investment choices, which in turn limits your level of diversification and possibly your returns over the long run.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: if you avoid these two critical mistakes by starting to save – and invest &#8211; early, and by making sure your portfolio is diversified, you’ll be setting yourself up to watch your money grow over time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Broad-based investment vehicles with low fees and high levels of diversification, if appropriate to their specific circumstances, is one strategy to help clients toward their goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102602094\">http://www.cnbc.com/id/102602094</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm</a></li>\n<li>The S&amp;P 500 index is representative of domestic markets and includes the average performance of 500 widely held common stocks.

If so, you know the full range of emotions that come with a growing family. Along with the love and excitement you feel with a new baby boy or girl, comes the pressure of new responsibilities and additional financial obligations.</p>\n<p>Babies change your life in many ways, including requiring large amounts of time and money. While you may already be thinking about childcare costs and options, or about paying the medical bills that accompanied your new child, there are several other – important &#8211; financial considerations you should be thinking about even before the new baby arrives.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate Financial Priorities</strong>. It’s important to consider both short-term and long-term expenses that come with the addition of a new family member. It is a natural impulse, for instance, to want to put your child first and redirect retirement savings into college savings. But remember, you can borrow for college but you cannot borrow your way through retirement. It’s also important to balance long-term goals, like retirement and college expenses, with current financial needs, to help you allocate resources in an appropriate way.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Insurance Needs and Your Will</strong>. With the expansion of your family, insurance needs can change significantly. Having enough insurance is important in feeling confident about your family’s financial future. Adding your child to your health insurance policy can usually be done with a phone call. Making sure you have enough life insurance for both parents can help ensure you have the funds to raise your child if the unthinkable happens. Short-term disability insurance provides benefits if you have an accident that takes you out of work temporarily. Long-term disability insurance is critical in case a major accident has a permanent impact on your ability to work and earn. While some companies offer disability insurance, it can also be purchased independently.</p>\n<p>Updating your will or creating a trust can provide care instructions for your child and allocate resources for their upbringing. Without a will or trust, if you and your spouse die, the state will decide who will raise your children. A will establishes your wishes for who will care for your child. A trust can direct funds specifically earmarked for raising your children and can be an effective way to cover financial expenses and provide for college expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Start Planning For College Early</strong>. The sooner you start the better. While it is impossible to know exactly how much you’ll need to save &#8211; given that you don’t know what kind of college your child will choose – consider that in 2013-2014 the cost of a moderate in-state public university was $22,826 per academic year and the cost of a “moderate” private university averaged <strong>$44,750</strong>, according to a College Board survey. ¹</p>\n<p>For new parents this means that college could cost over <strong>$100,000</strong> for a public college and more than double that number for private school. Instead of trying to fund the entire cost of their education, determine how much you want to contribute. Having children be responsible for a part of their education is often a good lesson in work ethic, even if you can afford to pay for everything, and a critical life lesson if you can’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep Spending and Debt under Control</strong>. When you have an adorable child it’s very easy to overspend. You want them to have the best of everything. Setting a budget and sticking with that can help you keep your spending in line with your established budget. This can also help you maintain the discipline needed to continue contributions to long-term financial goals like retirement and their college education. And remember, the best gift you can give your children – your time and attention – is free.</p>\n<p>Another important consideration is debt. When you carry debt, you are paying today for yesterday’s bills. Investing potentially allows you to pay today for tomorrow’s bills. By keeping yesterday’s bills settled and debt to a minimum, you lay the foundations for having enough to enjoy today with your children and plan for tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Teach Children About Finances At An Early Age</strong>. Finances are a part of our daily lives. When you involve children early on they gain an appreciation for what things cost and how to choose what we want and what we can live without. As soon as your child old enough, start helping save their pennies for something they really want, and teach them that work is part of the process of earning money. These skills, if taught early, can lead to a lifetime of responsible money management.</p>\n<p>Parenting is an amazing adventure that changes the way you see yourself and the world.

According to a 2013 American Express survey, <strong>60 percent</strong> of small business owners said they weren’t saving enough for retirement, and over <strong>73 percent</strong> said they were worried about not being able to afford the lifestyle they want in retirement.</p>\n<p>While many employees can choose to make automatic deductions from their paycheck towards a 401k, for instance, entrepreneurs have to make a conscious decision to sock away money for retirement, as well as find plans that work for them.</p>\n<p>Fortunately there are several things that you can begin doing now to contributing to your long-term financial future. As always, please review these and other options with your financial planner to see what strategy may be most suitable for your individual situation.</p>\n<h3><strong>1) Open an IRA</strong></h3>\n<p>If you haven’t already, now may be as good a time as any to open an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). IRAs are long term investments that allow you to save money for the future in a tax efficient way. They also offer catch up contributions if you’re over 50.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Traditional vs. Roth</em></strong></p>\n<p>Traditional IRAs allow you to deduct contributions the year in which they are made, then pay taxes when you withdraw the money. A Roth IRA allows you to pay taxes on your contributions now, rather than upon withdrawal and earnings and distributions may not be taxable if held in the Roth IRA for up to 5 years.</p>\n<p>For older investors who are approaching retirement, traditional IRAs probably make more sense, as their tax rate may likely be lower in retirement than it is currently. Younger investors, however, may want to consider a Roth IRA if they believe their tax rate could be higher in the future than when they make their contributions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Contribution Limitations</em></strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of whether you elect to contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA the IRS sets annual limits each year stating the maximum individuals can contribute to their IRA based on their annual earnings. For instance, in 2015 you are limited to a maximum of <strong>$5,500</strong> annually (or <strong>$6,500</strong> if you are 50 or over).</p>\n<p>Finally, with either type of IRA, there are penalties and taxes for early withdrawals prior to 59 ½ years old!</p>\n<p>Please consult your tax professional regarding your specific situation and the specific rules that apply to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2) Consider alternative forms of IRAs to increase your contribution limits</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are your company’s only employee, or you only have a couple of other employees, you may want to look into setting up either an<strong> SEP-IRA or a SIMPLE-IRA.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>SEP-IRA</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SEP-IRAs</strong> allow you to contribute up to 25% of your salary, or $53,000 (as of 2015) whichever is smaller. This is significantly more than what non-SEP-IRAs allow for.</p>\n<p>Setting up a <strong>SEP-IRA</strong> may be an easy choice if you and your spouse are your only employees, but there can be other costs associated if you have other people working for you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>SIMPLE-IRAs</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SIMPLE-IRAs</strong> provide an alternative that is cheaper for companies with several employees.</p>\n<p>With the <strong>SIMPLE-IRA,</strong> the employer creates an IRA for each employee. Employees have the option to contribute a certain percentage of their income to their IRA. Employers are then required to match that percentage up to a maximum of three percent of the person’s salary, or contribute two percent of each person’s salary into the IRA.</p>\n<p>By creating a <strong>SIMPLE-IRA</strong> the owner is then able to contribute an additional $12,500 ($15,500 for those 50 and over) to his or her own IRA.</p>\n<p>If you have only a few employees working for you and you expect to contribute either the full $12,500 or a large portion of it, there is a good chance that your tax savings may more than pay for the cost of contributing to your employee’s IRAs. Please consult your tax professional for more specific information about how this could affect you and your employees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3) Setup Automatic Deductions</strong></h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, we all have a tendency to procrastinate, and thinking about retirement is often not at the top of our priorities! It’s easy for entrepreneurs and small business owners in particular to become distracted and forget to contribute to your retirement account(s). Automatic deductions solve this problem.</p>\n<p>By setting up your IRA and other retirement accounts to take money directly out of your bank account or paycheck each week (or month,) you can ensure that you contribute as much money as you feel you can, up to the full tax deductible amount, each year. You no longer have to worry about forgetting to, or putting off, contributing.</p>\n<p>With any IRA, think carefully about how much you can realistically contribute. They are considered long term investments and you cannot access the money prior to a specific age without incurring taxes and significant penalties for making early withdrawals. Please make sure you are carefully considering your short and medium term goals. And remember: starting to save early is a good way to get on the road to achieving your goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4) Speak with as Experienced Financial Planner to Help You Create a Plan</strong></h3>\n<p>Taking care of long-term financial goals can be a challenge but fortunately you don’t have to go it alone.

Whether there’s a hot new sector that seems to be on fire, or a classic U.S. company that seems poised for a new burst of life, or, worse, a pundit who keeps warning us not to get caught flat-footed.</p>\n<p>It’s human nature to be attracted to the next shiny new thing. My 2-year old son was perfectly happy playing with his trusty push truck, for instance, until he got a shiny red Matchbox car for his birthday and abandoned the – still very serviceable &#8211; truck.</p>\n<p>It’s also human nature to try to catch winners on the way up and want to abandon the underperformers. But that doesn’t mean it’s always a good idea.</p>\n<p>While the market as a whole has done quite well over the last 20 years &#8211; the S&amp;P 500 has returned approximately 9.9%, and a diversified portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds would have returned 8.7% [1]<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a>– the same can’t be said for the average investor.</p>\n<p>During the 10 year period from 2003- 2013, the average investor’s portfolio only returned 2.6% annually, [2] barely a quarter of what the S&amp;P returned, and not much higher than the rate of inflation.</p>\n<p>What’s the reason for this underperformance?</p>\n<p>By trying to beat the market by chasing performance, by trying to time markets, and by overpaying in fees, investors hurt their returns significantly.</p>\n<h3>Chasing Returns</h3>\n<p>When a particular investment is performing well, investors often get excited and invest more, causing the price to continue to climb. As it does, more investors are attracted to its returns &#8211; even as the stock becomes more expensive &#8211; causing the price to rise even more.</p>\n<p>Eventually however the investment will return to its intrinsic value, and fluctuate slightly around that number.</p>\n<p>When that happens, the investors who tried to chase performance and bought on the more expensive upswing, will lose money or underperform the market.</p>\n<h3>Timing the Market</h3>\n<p>It is not surprising that investors try to time the market. If we were able to predict when markets would top and when they would bottom, we’d all be enjoying extraordinary returns. In reality, however, very few people who try to time the markets actually succeed.</p>\n<p>According to Morningstar, market timing costs the average investor 1.5% annually. For a hypothetical portfolio that returned 8.7% annually, a 1.5% additional ‘expense’ ends up eating up over 17% of the investor’s returns.</p>\n<p>Warren Buffet once said, “the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good.” Famed investor Peter Lynch said, “Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves”. [3]</p>\n<p>If Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch don’t believe in trying to time the market, and studies have shown that strategies that try to time the market have very low success rates, it’s a good sign that you’re probably better off not trying too.</p>\n<h3>Overpaying Fees</h3>\n<p>If you are chasing returns, and trying to time the market, chances are you are making more trades than you would with a buy-and-hold strategy. That means you are paying more fees, which also affects your overall rate of return negatively.</p>\n<h3>A Potential Solution</h3>\n<p>The smarter approach may be to <strong>do less</strong>. Investors have historically hurt their returns by over-trading. Looking at your portfolio too often or constantly checking up on how the markets are doing can be detrimental to your finances if you are prone to reacting too impulsively. Rather than trying to time the market, or always buying the next hot stock or asset class, investors tend to have more success by taking a hands off approach.</p>\n<p>Yes, his red Matchbox car is shiny and bright. But, as my son grows up, I hope he’ll learn to value the tried and true as well. And smart investors do the same, thinking carefully before they leap into the next big thing, or try to catch the current wave and ride it to the top.</p>\n<p>Sometimes doing less is doing more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor to determine if your current portfolio and your current strategy are appropriate for your individual investment needs.</p>\n<p>1) https://www.jpmorganfunds.com/blobcontentheader/202/900/1158474868049_jp-littlebook.pdf  (page 65)</p>\n<p>2) http://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2014/04/24/why-the-average-investors-investment-return-is-so-low/</p>\n<p>3) http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/your-money/forget-market-timing-and-stick-to-a-balanced-fund.html?_r=0</p>\n<p>LFS-1189812-050415</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We’ve all been tempted.

Probably the only money questions on your mind are the down payments for the caterers and the florists!</p>\n<p>Yet &#8211; whether your wedding reflects a minimalist sensibility or is a no-holds-barred extravaganza &#8211; it&#8217;s better to have a good understanding of each other&#8217;s finances <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">before</span> the “I Do’s”. This is a time when procrastination could cost you a bundle, even if neither one of you currently have a lot of assets.</p>\n<p>Getting married is more than just substituting the word <strong>“ours”</strong> for <strong>“yours”</strong> and <strong>“mine”</strong>.  It&#8217;s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions &#8211; even your music &#8211; and making all of that <strong>“ours</strong><strong>”</strong> too. Since a significant part of those dreams and aspirations involve money, having multiple financial conversations before marriage (or right after, if you&#8217;re newlyweds!) can help you start married life on a firmer footing, with regard to financial goals.</p>\n<h3><strong>Here are a few conversations that will get your marriage off to a smoother financial start:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong> 1) Views on money.</strong> How we feel about money is often very emotional and very personal. Our family’s views on money can have a big impact on the way we see finances. In some families money may not be talked about. In others, one partner may hide money or spending from the other. While we might not consciously have these same behaviors, our upbringing will have an impact on how we feel about money and how we save, spend, and budget.</p>\n<p>The best way to address unconscious &#8211; and sometimes conflicting &#8211; money behaviors is to start by recognizing how you each feel about money. Then you can take a practical approach and implement the best strategies from the past and incorporate them into your new relationship. This will also give you a chance to address any not-so-beneficial attitudes and behaviors and work to consciously change them.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Spending/Saving Habits</strong>. Chances are the two of you don&#8217;t spend and save money the same way. The interesting thing about spending and saving habits is that they give insight into priorities, both financial and otherwise because we tend to spend money on things we feel are most important and scoff at spending on things we see as unimportant.  Some people value saving more than anything and could be considered “tightwads”. Other people have a “live for today” attitude and spend whatever they have available, saving nothing or little for later. Most of us find ourselves somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p>Not agreeing on spending priorities can lead to serious conflicts down the line. While there is no right and wrong answer regarding priorities and habits, it&#8217;s valuable to know and understand each other’s habits earlier rather than later.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Divvying Up the Bills.</strong> This is an important conversation about how you will manage your money together. Will you have separate or joint accounts? Who will be responsible for paying the bills and investing for long term goals? A realistic understanding both of your current incomes and current debts is important so you can create a realistic budget based on your combined income and expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Credit History.</strong> No one likes to talk about credit ratings because they highlight past mistakes and spending habits. Yet it&#8217;s essential to know and discuss your credit histories. This can help you talk about past money mistakes, current debt loads, and how to address any issues that are lurking. Having this conversation now will also help if you&#8217;re planning to borrow money for a large purchase, such as a home or car; credit history will effect how much you&#8217;ll pay in interest for loans, as well as how much it will cost for things like insurance. Many companies even pull credit for potential job applicants. When it comes to credit, it&#8217;s best not to have surprises down the road, so have the conversation now.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Risk Tolerance and Financial Goals.</strong> Couples often have very strong &#8211; and differing &#8211; feelings about risk and money that are deeply rooted in past experiences.  Your family may have gone through periods of unemployment, for instance, or  you may have grown up taking financial security for granted. One of your parents may have owned a business and you saw it go bankrupt,  so you might be very conservative with your money and not want to take unnecessary chances. Or perhaps they invested in a business that was a huge success.</p>\n<p>Everyone brings a different level of comfort when it comes to risk tolerance and it&#8217;s important to understand your partner&#8217;s because it has an impact on spending and savings habits &#8211; everything from where you invest to how much money you want to set aside. Money provides a level of security that can be very powerful and risk tolerance is directly linked to that feeling of security.</p>\n<p><strong> 6) Ongoing Financial Obligations.</strong> If this is a second marriage, are there child support or alimony payments that need to be considered in the budget process? If so, how much and how long will the obligations need to be fulfilled. Caring for elderly parents might also be a long term expense you will be facing as a couple.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Net Worth.</strong> When it&#8217;s a first marriage, often neither partner has much in the way of assets, but if one partner has more than the other, are you going to want a pre-nuptial agreement? When discussing net worth it is valuable to discuss not only current net worth, but also aspiring net worth. What household income level are you both hoping to achieve. Will reaching those aspirations include additional education? Will it mean switching jobs several times early in your career? Will it mean working 80 hours a week for decades? As a couple, understanding financial expectations and future net worth aspirations will help you plan a life together that will meet both of your needs, financially and emotionally.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Family Plans.</strong> The family size you hope to have will also have a big impact on your financial needs. Children, as wonderful as they are, are very expensive to raise. Do you both want to have children and, if so, one child or several children? Discussions about how the children will be raised and educated are also valuable from a financial perspective. Will one of you stay home to raise the children? Will you pay for day care? How far apart should the children be? Each of these answers will have a significant financial impact to the family budget.</p>\n<p><strong> 9) Combining Physical and Financial Assets.</strong> Particularly with couples getting married later, both partners will have accumulated possessions that now need to be combined. This can be as simple as which sofa and bedroom set to keep, or more complicated when multiple homes, retirement accounts, and other investments are brought into the mix. Discussing whether property, accounts, and debt should be left in individual names or held jointly is also an important conversation to have.</p>\n<p><strong>10) Wills, Trusts, and Life Insurance.</strong> When you&#8217;re getting married, you don’t really want to think about death. Yet wills, trusts, and life insurance need to be updated soon after you say, <strong>“I Do.”</strong> This is true especially if you have assets or children. The process of obtaining a will or trust is fairly straightforward; it’s the discussions that lead up to it that provide the most value. Both of you should have a good understanding of what you have and what you want to happen, should the unthinkable occur.</p>\n<p>Financial advisors can be a real asset, when it comes to pre-marital financial discussions. They can help you determine when it is best to hold assets jointly or separately. Assistance with budgeting and planning for long term goals will help you create a strong financial plan. Advisors can also guide you in building a strategy for reaching financial milestones.</p>\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re getting married (or just got married), <strong>congratulations</strong>! And while these discussions may not be the most romantic ones you&#8217;re having, they do have the ability to bring you closer together. Planning together and sharing your dreams will give you better insight into the mind and heart of the person you&#8217;ve fallen in love with and allow you to become stronger partners when it comes to reaching your goals as a couple, emotional as well as financial.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Being able to juggle several balls in the air and multi-task is par for the course for this generation. So why do Millennials often struggle with how to prioritize between saving for the future and paying down debt?</p>\n<p>Many Millennials still have college loans to pay off or have acquired credit card debt while taking home minimal starting salaries. And advice about how to get started is confusing: some financial professionals recommend having at least one month of income saved prior to starting to pay down your debt, while others recommend up to 8 months of savings. That&#8217;s a daunting prospect when you&#8217;re young and living from paycheck to paycheck!</p>\n<p>Because of the power of compounding interest, the 20s and 30s are your prime savings years. Not taking advantage of the opportunity to save now may end up costing you later. So how can you start to build your savings <em>and</em> pay down debt, while still maintaining a reasonable quality of life?</p>\n<p>The good news is that &#8211; because they&#8217;re used to a struggling economy &#8211; Millennials have become very resourceful when it comes to finances. Here are several factors to consider when you&#8217;re deciding how much you can &#8211; or even if you can &#8211; allocate for both.</p>\n<h3>Three Questions to consider about saving vs. debt:</h3>\n<p><strong>What is my monthly incoming &amp; outgoing cash flow? </strong>Hopefully it&#8217;s not negative! If it is, though, try to find daily and household expenses that can be trimmed or eliminated (that venti caramel latte? An expensive cable package?) If it&#8217;s positive, determine if there&#8217;s enough left over to pay credit card minimums while allocating a portion, however small, toward a saving plan.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the interest rate on my debt?</strong> Debt with an interest rate of higher than 5% is a priority to pay down, otherwise you&#8217;re spending your hard-earned cash on borrowing costs. Can you roll over your debt to a lower-interest or zero-interest credit card? If not, create an action plan to pay off high-interest debt first. If you have debt with interest rates that are lower than<strong> 5%</strong>, consider contributing to a <strong>401K</strong> or a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. The same way interest compounds with your debts, it also grows with your savings, so the sooner you take action, the more you will gain over time.</p>\n<p><strong>What is my stress level regarding debt?</strong> If the stress of having debt is overwhelming, then make paying the debt before contributing to your savings a priority. If your debt seems manageable, start getting in the habit of making monthly contributions to a savings plan.</p>\n<p>Remember, no two people, and no two financial plans, are alike. Whether you can contribute to a savings plan and pay down debt simultaneously depends on you and your unique situation. Talking to a financial advisor can help put you on a path that is right for you. The important thing is to create a goal and a plan!</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-budgeting-and-saving/\">Budgeting and Savings planning</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\">What’s your Credit Score?</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brad Sherman is a financial planner who is committed to helping individuals and families achieve financial independence and gain confidence with regard to financial issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Call or contact him today to see if his services are a good fit for your needs.</span></p>\n<p id=\":r0\" class=\"hP\" tabindex=\"-1\">LFS-989662-081314</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Millennials have an entrepreneurial spirit and tend to have a lot on their plates.

If you get started now, you&#8217;ll be maximizing your chances of hitting those marks on your way to achieving your goals!</p>\n<p>Here are some basic tips to help you get started.</p>\n<h3>7 Tips For The Long Term Investor</h3>\n<p>● <b>Start today</b><b>:</b> Procrastination can put a large dent in your ultimate savings. Whether you&#8217;re investing in a retirement savings plans or a regular investment account, it&#8217;s important to start early so that your investments compound. Remember, even small amounts add up over time!</p>\n<p>● <b>Create a plan and stick with it:</b> There are many ways to be successful and no one strategy is inherently better than any other. Once you find your style, stick with it. Bouncing in and out of the market makes is just as likely you will miss some of the best days and hit the worst.  Readjust your portfolio when necessary, but not too often.</p>\n<p>● <b>Think long term and be disciplined:</b> Be prepared to buy and hold your positions. Big short-term profits can be enticing when you&#8217;re new to the market but short-term wins will get you off track. Start a program, stay invested, and don’t be too concerned with day-to-day profits and losses.  Warren Buffet once asked, “Suppose you’re going to be investing for the next several years. Do you want the price of the stocks to go up or down?&#8221; While everybody assumes it&#8217;s &#8220;up,&#8221; in reality, it’s only people who are withdrawing in the near future who really want stocks to go up!</p>\n<p>● <b>Do your research:</b> Always be an informed investor. Do your own due diligence with companies you&#8217;re interested in. Don’t go for a ‘hot tip’ just because there&#8217;s a lot of buzz; research companies, get advice, and decide if they&#8217;re investments that are right for you.</p>\n<p>● <b>Never let your emotions influence you:</b> The markets move in cycles. When the markets are up, we feel elated about our investment decisions. When markets start to move down, we may experience anxiety and panic. Reacting emotionally can lead to spur of the moment decisions that don&#8217;t benefit you in the long run. Again: think long term.</p>\n<p>● <b>Always have a margin of safety:</b> The first rule anyone new to investing needs to learn is that there are no guarantees in the stock market. An investment that looks great on paper does not always pan out in real life.  Know how much risk you are willing to take and make sure your investments are aligned with your risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>● <b>Diversify:</b> Never put all your eggs in one kind of basket.

Among those surveyed, some of the most common reasons given were that money was too personal a topic, it felt uncomfortable to talk about, or it was considered &#8220;taboo.&#8221; Additionally, women are also more likely to feel that they don’t know enough about the subject to speak about it intelligently. This is despite the fact that <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/women-make-investors/story?id=15039090\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">studies have shown that women tend to be better investors than men.</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Money is, however, a critical subject that we all need to discuss &#8211; and discuss often &#8211; in relationships. A little while ago I wrote about the </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/7-things-married-couples-discuss-today/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">7 Things Married Couples Should Discuss Today</span></a><span class=\"s1\">, where I talked about why it is critical that married couples go over their finances together. Marriage is not, however, the only relationship that requires having difficult conversations about money. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to communicate with our parents and children about money, and even friends, coworkers and extended family members in some cases.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With money playing such an important role in our daily lives, it&#8217;s critical that we learn to overcome our desire to avoid the topic and learn how to effectively and confidently communicate about financial matters. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fortunately there are a few things you can do to make the topic of money easier to discuss:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. Realize that difficult conversations are sometimes necessary</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether you need to confront your parents about their retirement plans, your spouse about where to allocate investments, or your children about their spending habits money can be a difficult topic to talk about. By reminding yourself that these are conversations that you will ultimately need to have however you are setting yourself up for success.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. Find someone knowledgeable about finances who you can trust</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No one has all the answers when it comes to money, which is why it is often helpful to turn to others for ideas and suggestions. You should find someone &#8211; whether it’s a friend, family member or a financial advisor &#8211; who is knowledgeable, who you know has your best interests at heart, and with whom you feel comfortable speaking.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will give you the opportunity to ask questions, bounce around ideas, and learn and grow. It will also give you the confidence to discuss finances with others.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. Get educated</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the best ways to feel comfortable discussing money with others is by learning as much about the subject as you can. Read books, ask questions, and get help when needed. By learning as much as you can, you feel more comfortable giving advice, making financial decisions and having what would otherwise be difficult conversations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. Don’t procrastinate when discussing finances</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If there is a money-related conversation that you have been putting off, bring it up now or at the next time possible. Don’t wait!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">H</span><span class=\"s2\">ere</span><span class=\"s1\"> are a few more suggestions for important conversation starters:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your spouse:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Family’s budget</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Retirement savings</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Saving for children’s college fund</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Where to invest money</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your children:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allowance</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Spending</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Basic financial principles</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your parents:<br />\n</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Their retirement plans</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Location of legal documents including wills, trusts and insurance paperwork</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;re like most people, chances are there are many other subjects that you need to discuss with those you&#8217;re close to.

The media loves to paint Millennials as “<strong>adventurous</strong>”, “<strong>risk takers</strong>,” and “<strong>thrill seekers</strong>.” But, surprisingly, when it comes to financial planning for Millennials, their behavior is <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/millennials-fiscally-conservative/\">anything but risky</a>.</p>\n<p>In fact, there is evidence that, while emotions and biases play a large part in Millennials&#8217; investment decisions,  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fear-keeps-millennials-investing-sidelines/\"><strong>fear</strong> leads the list of behavioral influences</a>.</p>\n<p>We Millennials grew up during the Internet crash and have witnessed one of the most turbulent market cycles in recent U.S. history. With the financial crisis of 2008, and the housing bust leading to a recession, many of us have watched our parents struggle with financial security and worry about whether they&#8217;ll ever be able to retire. Many recent grads have experienced unemployment as a result of the crisis, and many are burdened with significant student loan debt. Good times? Not.</p>\n<p>These experiences during their impressionable years have led many Millennials to take an emotionally driven approach to Financial Planning for Millennials and to adopt conservative money habits that analysts have compared to the investment behavior of young adults during the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>They tend to be wary of investing in equities, for instance, resorting to a behavioral bias that favors peer narratives and unscientific anecdotes – such as stories of retirement-age people whose nest eggs were destroyed by the financial crisis &#8211; over careful data analysis.</p>\n<p>In May 2013, Wells Fargo released the results of a study surveying more than 1,400 Millennials, that found that Millennials <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/millennials-time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-stock-market/\">view the stock market</a>, and most investments, as a risk not worth taking. More than half of Millennials are “<strong>not very confident</strong>” or “<strong>not at all confident</strong>” about the stock market and many of the Millennials who do consider investing in stocks see the market as a short-term investment. The survey also found that Millennials&#8217; primary concerns were student loan debt and paying their monthly bills.</p>\n<p>In fact, Millennials have not only taken on more student loan debt than any previous generation but they continue to struggle in a challenging job market. With many Millennials remaining unemployed or underemployed, and with bills and debt as their top priorities, they have very little disposable income for investing. Many, according to a Pew Research poll released in October 2013, did not even begin thinking about saving or establishing a 401(k) until about five years into their careers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a UBS Wealth Management survey report featured on <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com\">Bankrate.com</a> found that, more 39% of the Millennials surveyed &#8211; more than any other age group &#8211; said that cash is their preferred way to invest money that they don&#8217;t need for at least ten years. That&#8217;s three times the number who chose to invest in the stock market, despite the fact that the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> has gained 17% over the past year while most cash investment yields remain below 1%.</p>\n<h3>The Danger of Playing it Safe</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The problem with short-term stock investment approaches and dipping in and out of the stock market is that it can work against investors, because short-term investments may be subject to a higher rate of <strong>volatility</strong>. Instead of looking at the long-term data, which shows that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">stocks typically outperform</a> other more conservative asset classes over the long run, those young investors are fearful of the short-range volatility, clouding data about the positive potential of long-term investing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">That reluctance to get into the market can be <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/generation-long-term-financial-goals/\">problematic for long-term portfolio</a> growth because, without the returns from stocks, it can be difficult to reach savings and retirement goals.</span></p>\n<h3>Bigger is Not Always Better…When Finding a Financial Advisor</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">With the crash of the big banks and the negative publicity surrounding Wall Street financial firms, Millennials became a generation that looked at financial professionals with mistrust. Instead, they rely more heavily on the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\"><strong>Internet</strong>, <strong>social media</strong>, and <strong>personal networks</strong> for financial advice</a>. Their experience with market volatility and lack of job security has had a significant impact on their attitudes and behaviors toward investing. With very little disposable income after bills and debt payment, Millennials want to feel a sense of security with their investments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">When it comes to working with a financial professional, ‘old school’, traditional banking services are of no interest to them. Bigger is not better in their minds; a <strong>smaller, more independent financial planning firm</strong> may be able to offer a more hands-on and collaborative approach to investing that Millennials feel more comfortable with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">It’s important to Millennials that they find <strong>someone they can trust</strong> and who can relate to their concerns and be open to new ideas and methods of investing. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Sherman Wealth Management </a>understands that being a part of the investing process is a must in financial planning for Millennials. We fill a role for clients who can no longer relate to, or trust, the large financial institutions that once held a stronghold in the marketplace. The professionals at Sherman Wealth Management provide a personalized plan for investing and help our clients navigate through the difficulty of prioritizing financial obligations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Remember how it was the overconfidence of the large financial firms and irresponsible investors that brought us the financial crisis in the first place? That Millennial reluctance to let history blindly repeat itself may turn out to be a pretty good thing after all!</span></p>\n<h3>Learn more about Financial Planning for Millennials and our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\">Financial Planning services.</a></h3>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-planning-tips-new-parents/\">5 Planning Tips for New Parents</a></p>\n<p>LFS-1143605-030915</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What do you think of when you think of Millennials?

While you&#8217;re probably looking forward to this windfall, there are reasons why you may wish to minimize your end-of-year refund.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why Big Refunds are Bad</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taxes are refunded to you when the Government takes too much of your pay each pay period. By overpaying each paycheck, only to get the money returned to you once a year, you are essentially lending the Government money at zero percent interest. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is money that could have been budgeted for and spent, or invested, throughout the year. Even if you had put the money in a savings account over the year, you still would be better off.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How to Minimize Your Refund</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to adjust the amount that is withheld for the IRS each pay period you need to fill out/change your W-4 form.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The W-4 allows you to specify allowances or exemptions that you are eligible for.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">These can include:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Donations to charitable organizations</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interest on a home mortgage</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interest on student loan debt</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Contributions to traditional IRAs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The W-4 form estimates the amount that you would receive from a tax refund. This amount is then distributed over the number of weeks remaining in the tax year, lowering the amount withheld from your paycheck each pay period.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You should also look into filling out a new W-4 every time you have experienced a major change in your life. Examples of this include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Switching jobs</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marriage</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Having a child</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Losing a dependent (They either file their own tax return, or you can no longer claim them)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While trying to lower the amount that is withheld in taxes each pay period generally makes sense, it may be prudent to not list all of the exemptions you are eligible for on your W-4.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why You May Not Want to Claim all Your Allowances</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While having too much in taxes withheld can be compared to lending the Government money at a rate of zero percent interest, the reverse is also true. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you underpay in taxes each paycheck, you end up owing money to the Government. In theory this is great. You could put the money in a savings account, and then at the end of the year pay back the Government while pocketing the interest that you collected. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In practice however this is not a prudent strategy for most people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Individuals have a tendency to spend money that they have, and forget about longer-term consequences of their actions. Additionally while receiving a refund at the end of the year is exciting, the opposite is also true.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is why it may make sense for you to leave a few deductions you are eligible for unlisted on your W-4. This ensures that you receive a tax refund, albeit a smaller one, rather than owing money.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What to Do When You Do Receive a Refund</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While this advice can be helpful for next year, chances are this year’s tax season will provide you with a large refund.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you do receive a large refund there are a series of things you can consider to maximize its value. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Invest in yourself – Sometimes the best investment you can make is in yourself. Consider buying a book or taking a class to help improve your performance in work or at life.</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Get your will done – this can often cost less than a $1,000 in total but can save your beneficiary’s significantly more both in terms of money as well as headache</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Put money into a college savings plan </span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay down your mortgage</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Invest in a non-tax-exempt account – if you have already maxed out your IRA</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Save for a rainy day</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Open/add to an IRA</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay off student loan debt</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay off credit card debt – if you have any credit card debt, this should be an immediate priority</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Save the money and increase your 401(k) contributions – put your money in a safe place such as a savings account, and bump up your 401(k) contributions to reflect the fact that you have this money sitting on the side.</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of what you do with your tax refund, it is important that you come up with a plan. A trusted financial planner can help you in the process of creating one.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With over a decade’s worth of experience in the financial services industry <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Brad Sherman</a> is committed to helping individual investors plan and prepare for retirement.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Having grown up with social media and the internet, this generation is not as private as their parents and grandparents are, especially about subjects like money and finance. The advantage is that open conversations can reduce fears and increase understanding, which can result in better decision making.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yet, with all this comfort in discussing financial matters, many <strong>Millennials</strong> are hesitant to meet with a financial advisor. It&#8217;s one thing to gather information from family and friends or read articles about investing, it&#8217;s another to discuss your personal information with a financial advisor. That&#8217;s when it moves from theoretical to personal and that can create a great deal of fear and discomfort.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why Fear Gets the Best of Us</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How Much Do You Really Know About Finances</b><strong>?</strong> As educated professionals, it&#8217;s common to feel like you should know everything. After all, if you don’t understand it, a few internet searches should provide the answers! </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When it comes to money matters, though, many Millennials feel like a fish out of water. Internet searches can provide information that&#8217;s both confusing and conflicting, and that doesn&#8217;t answer individual questions about strategy and direction. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then there is the question of what information can be trusted. Is the site legitimate and can the writer&#8217;s &#8211; and site&#8217;s &#8211; motivation be trusted? While financial information is plentiful, much of it&#8217;s either very general or coming from a sales site that promises a secret formula that will turn you into a millionaire. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Financial decisions by nature are very individual and personal. Because there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all investing strategy, personal consultations are invaluable.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Advisor motivations</b>. Can the advisor be trusted? A trusted advisor needs to understand your circumstances, goals, dreams, and aspirations. Once they do, they can help to create a long term strategy that will help to make those dreams a reality. But you must be able to trust that your advisor will make recommendations that are most beneficial to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">you</span>, the client, not the best for them, the advisor.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Addressing these concerns in an open conversation will go a long way. No one wants to be sold a product. We all want to invest money in a sound strategy. Understanding the reasons for the recommendation will help you understand how it may benefit you and help you pursue your long term goals. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Fear of not being understood</b>. As complicated individuals we want to appear like we have everything in order. In reality, sometimes we&#8217;re confident, other times not so much. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Financial advisors have seen nearly every level of financial preparedness. They have seen financial messes and worked with clients to get things corrected. They have seen strong portfolios, weak portfolios, no portfolio, and everything in between.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if you don&#8217;t feel you have all your ducks in a row, an advisor can help. If you&#8217;ve made bad decisions in the past, they can make recommendations for corrective action. If you&#8217;ve been unable to get things in order on your own, working with a professional can be the fastest way to get on track.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Markets not doing as expected</b>. This can go two ways. If you invest conservatively and the market takes off you might end up kicking yourself for not being more aggressive. If the markets are slow and you invest aggressively you can end up wishing you&#8217;d been more conservative. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you meet with an advisor, you&#8217;re meeting with a professional who understands the investment business and who can make recommendations that are consistent with your financial goals. An advisor does not have a crystal ball; remember that long term investing is not about beating the markets, it’s about making strong financial decisions that over time will lead to increased confidence in financial matters.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pulling the Trigger</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first step is always the hardest. This is true whether you&#8217;re trying to establish a workout routine, learn a new language, start a new job, or change your investing strategy. Resisting change is natural and we are creatures of habit. However, there comes a point when, in order to grow and progress, we have to stop making excuses and get started by meeting with a financial advisor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make the appointment. Even if you don’t think you know enough, have enough money to invest, have a good enough paying job, or whatever the excuses for delays have been. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Before you meet with the advisor</b>, write down questions you have. What things have you heard and what things do you want to understand. This can guide the conversation as you begin to develop a relationship with an advisor. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A financial advisor at <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Sherman Wealth</a> is someone you&#8217;ll want to get to know! You&#8217;ll want them to know everything about you and your family’s needs.

Be sure to reexamine your goals and your portfolio to make sure that you&#8217;re both saving enough for retirement, and that you <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">maintain a proper asset allocation</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Life Insurance</strong> – While not a pleasant topic, it&#8217;s important to discuss with your partner what will happen in the event that one of you passes prematurely. If one, or both of you, are dependent on the other person’s income, you may want to consider purchasing a term-life insurance policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Wills and Trusts</strong> – Like life insurance, wills and trusts also are important for protecting your loved ones. They&#8217;re especially critical if you have children, or a significant amount of assets. Make sure that your assets are directed in a way that&#8217;s consistent with your wishes.</li>\n<li><strong>College Funds</strong> – If you have children, or are considering having children, you definitely want to discuss a saving strategy to help pay for college tuition. Like retirement savings, a little bit now can go a long way.</li>\n<li><strong>Health Insurance</strong> – Make sure that you and your partner are both covered, and that you understand the differences &#8211; and overlaps &#8211; in  your plans. Is there any unnecessary overlap? Should you purchase more coverage to protect yourself? Or should you switch to a high-deductible plan to save money? These are questions that should be reviewed at least once annually!</li>\n<li><strong>Major Purchases</strong> – If you are planning to make a major purchase such as a home, or a new car, you&#8217;ve probably already talked with your partner about it. You may not have talked about how you&#8217;ll pay for it though! Some questions to consider: whether or not you&#8217;ll pay cash for the purchase;  if you finance it, what type of down payment you will make, and over what period of time; and if you need to cut down on expenses elsewhere to save up for the purchase.</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong> – Review your expenses each month to see where you can make changes and cut back. Consider making a budget together to make sure that you are allocating your income in the best possible way for both of you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While financial topics can be difficult to discuss, they&#8217;re an important part of a happy and successful relationship. Make sure that both you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to finances, and set short and long term goals <em>together</em> to help keep you both on track.</p>\n<p>If you need help going over your finances or coming up with a plan, it may be wise to contact a financial planner. Financial planners can help point you in the right direction, based on your own goals, and help facilitate difficult, but important, discussions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This might mean a percentage of every paycheck that is used for investing or a specific dollar amount. You might start with as little as <strong>$50</strong> a month or <strong>$50</strong> a pay period and that will begin to create a portfolio that pays for future needs.</p>\n<h3>Advantages of Dollar Cost Averaging</h3>\n<p><strong>1) Establishes a habit of investing.</strong> One of the largest benefits is you begin to pay yourself first and take care of future needs today. Establishing a habit of setting aside a little money for tomorrow will help you live within your means, have more thoughtful budgeting, and be better prepared.</p>\n<p><strong>2) The investment is built into your budget</strong>, and you learn to live on what remains. The interesting thing about money and finances is that you tend to spend what you have. If there is a little less in the account each month you will adjust spending to accommodate for what you have. Even if it does not appear that there is money for investing you might be surprised how easy it is to “find” a small amount that can be earmarked for investments. A simple thing like bringing lunch twice a week instead of eating out can result in saving over $50 a month to use for investing.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Dollar cost averaging purchases shares at a set time each month</strong> regardless of where the investment price is. This means if the price is lower you purchase more shares. If the market is higher less shares are bought. The result is a greater tolerance for market fluctuations because you gain a better understanding that the markets move every day.</p>\n<p><strong>4) No Large Sums Required to Begin.</strong> Dollar cost averaging can be started with small amounts of money. One possible strategy is to increase monthly contributions at least annually. The more you raise the contribution amount the larger and faster your investments may grow over time.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Flexibility.</strong> Monthly contribution amounts can be changed at any time. The amounts can be raised or lowered depending on life events that impact your budget. In a perfect world the contributions would always increase, but sometimes that does not match real life events. The ability to adjust contributions reduces risk and allows for greater flexibility to meet current demands.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Great long-term strategy.</strong> Building a portfolio from the ground up can be accomplished through dollar cost averaging and regular contributions. Your investment should grow over time through both additional contributions and portfolio growth. As you receive bonuses or other financial windfalls you can make additional one time contributions as your finances allow.</p>\n<p>When it comes to investing there are no short cuts. Starting early and making regular investments will help to provide financial security and accounts that will build over time. When you start early you are less tempted to take on more portfolio risk and are better able to reach long term financial goals.</p>\n<p>The future is uncertain and setting aside a little each month to pay for long term financial needs is one of the soundest ways to pursue financial security.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets.

Here are the five things investors get wrong that can harm their returns.</p>\n<h3><strong>Believing They Will Beat the Market</strong></h3>\n<p>Study after study shows that investors, including professionals, continually under perform the S&amp;P.</p>\n<p>In their most recent SPIVA (<strong>S&amp;P Indices vs. Active</strong>) report, released in September, McGraw Hill Financial found that more than <strong>85%</strong> of all funds underperformed the S&amp;P 500, the index found to represent the overall market. (1).</p>\n<p>What’s scarier is the fact that individual investors do even worse. In a 20 year study conducted by Dalbar, a financial services research firm, the average investor has seen a return of just <strong>2.1%</strong> compared with the S&amp;P’s annualized return of<strong> 7.8%</strong> (2).</p>\n<p>What causes this under performance?</p>\n<p>According to Dalbar the biggest reason for this under performance by investors is due to irrational behavioral biases. These include panic selling, under-diversifying, and chasing momentum (3).</p>\n<h3><strong>Chasing Hot Stocks</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>In a study done by the University of California Berkley, as well as UC Davis, researchers found that investors are much more likely to purchase shares in companies that have recently been in the news (4), bidding the price of these stocks up.</p>\n<p>Additionally many investors make the mistake of trying to chase performance by buying investments that have already risen significantly. A 2011 study by Baird, a wealth management firm, suggests that investors generally chase short-term performance by buying funds that have risen in the short run, and selling those that have performed poorly (5).</p>\n<p>The same can be said about the market as a whole where investors tend to purchase stocks after they have seen a large rise, and subsequently sell into weakness (6).</p>\n<p>In short, investors sell low, and buy high.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ignoring Fees</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>You probably know that fees are important, what you may not realize is just how important they are.</p>\n<p>Take for example two 30-year-old investors who each contribute <strong>$5,500</strong> annually to their IRAs. They both achieve<strong> 9%</strong> annualized returns, before fees, over the next 35 years. The only difference between them is that one investor pays annual fees of <strong>.5%</strong>, while the other investor pays <strong>2.5%</strong> in total fees. Over the course of their working career, investor A will have accumulated <strong>$1,059,859.21</strong> in their account while investor B will have <strong>$682,190.80</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>This is a hypothetical illustration only and is not indicative of any particular investment or performance. Return and principal value may fluctuate, so when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than the original cost. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</em></p>\n<p>In this example, <strong>Investor B’s</strong> IRA will be worth less than <strong>65%</strong> of <strong>Investor’s A</strong> account as a result of a <strong>2%</strong> difference in fees!</p>\n<h3><strong>Not Re-balancing<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>While buy-and-hold is usually a good strategy for most people, it is sometimes necessary for individuals to make slight tweaks to their investments.</p>\n<p>This is particularly important if you have had one asset class or investment rise or fall significantly more than the rest of your portfolio. In this case it is a good idea to re balance your portfolio in order to realign it with your target allocation. This ensures that you not only maintain diversity, but also that you buy low, and sell high, by buying assets that have fallen significantly and selling assets that have risen.</p>\n<h3><strong>Turning to the Wrong People for Advice</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>Financial advice and information has never been more accessible to the average investor than it is today. Between TV and the Internet, investors are bombarded with information on a daily basis. Unfortunately not all of this information is sound.</p>\n<p>Investors should consider carefully the source of any advice they receive, watching out for potential conflicts of interest. Before making any investment decisions you should carefully consider all options, and consider speaking with a financial advisor.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/customized-financial-portfolio-construction/\">Investment Management services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">Tips for Millennials to Understanding the Stock Market</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dollar-cost-averaging/\">What is Dollar Cost Averaging?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont/\">5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/resource-center/thought-leadership/spiva/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://us.spindices.com/resource-center/thought-leadership/spiva/</a></p>\n<p>2. <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/11621555/1/average-investor-20-year-return-astoundingly-awful.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.thestreet.com/story/11621555/1/average-investor-20-year-return-astoundingly-awful.html</a></p>\n<p>3. <a href=\"http://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/streettalk_100814.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/streettalk_100814.php</a></p>\n<p>4. <a href=\"http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf</a></p>\n<p>5. <a href=\"http://www.rwbaird.com/bolimages/Media/PDF/Whitepapers/Truth-About-Top-Performing-Money-Managers.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.rwbaird.com/bolimages/Media/PDF/Whitepapers/Truth-About-Top-Performing-Money-Managers.pdf</a></p>\n<p>6. <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/487000/sell-low-buy-high-are-investors-being-stupid-again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://theweek.com/articles/487000/sell-low-buy-high-are-investors-being-stupid-again</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><b>LFS-1101254-011915</b></span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Humans have a tendency to behave irrationally when it comes to money.

In a world where jobs are constantly changing, skills need continual updating and stability is hard to find, many are rethinking how retirement is viewed. Instead of thinking of retirement as a destination 30 or 40 years from now that must be funded with a huge cash reserve, thinking of creating financial independence through passive income streams feels more attainable.</p>\n<p>If financial independence is a strategy that will provide ongoing income there are several things that must be accomplished to make this a reality. Here are some tips and ideas on creating passive income.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Is Passive Income</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating a passive income stream, looks at investment opportunities through the lens of providing ongoing income, rather than accumulating large amounts of investments that will be withdrawn at some point in the future. The traditional passive income streams were social security and pension plans which would pay a set amount of money each month until you die. With these passive income streams additional work was not required and the funds would last until you died, ensuring you would never outlive the money.</p>\n<p>Today those traditional passive income streams like pensions cannot be relied on. This has left workers with 401ks and IRAs as the funding options for retirement. These are great options, but with jobs changing and the average worker going through a dozen or more jobs in a career, even this is not enough to provide ongoing security. This has required Millennials to be more creative when they think about savings, investing and preparing for an uncertain future.</p>\n<p>Having an investment portfolio that can provide a monthly income stream, a business that produces ongoing income, rental property, part time work or freelancing are all options for ongoing income. In the beginning these options require work and forethought but over time they can produce a passive income stream that can provide much higher levels of security.</p>\n<h3><strong>Keys to Building Passive Income</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Start Early</strong></h4>\n<p>As with all investments the more time a plan has to work and develop the better it will work for you. If you have a hobby you are passionate about that you can build into a viable business, starting now will give you decades to build the business into an operation that requires less of your time and attention. This income can then provide as a respite if you have employment gaps throughout your career. With both nontraditional and traditional investments alike, starting early will reap the highest level of benefits and income.</p>\n<h4><strong>Watch Spending</strong></h4>\n<p>Living frugally became a buzzword a few years back as it became more mainstream. Living within your means will always provide money that can be invested in your future, instead of paying for yesterday’s spending. The other advantage to frugal living is that you need less passive income to maintain your quality of life. As your income increases throughout your career, keeping your spending in tact will be rewarded with more investments that can be directed toward passive income opportunities.</p>\n<h4><strong>Keep Your Eyes Open for Opportunities</strong></h4>\n<p>Passive income requires creativity with investments. It means thinking in terms of multiple streams of income and investment options that will grow during your working years and then produce income when you need it. Many opportunities do not produce passive income immediately, but will over time.</p>\n<p>When you look at adding activities to your life that are more fulfilling, investment opportunities will present themselves. This might be a chance to earn a second income doing something you love. It might mean nontraditional ways of earning money. Thinking outside the box is the key. One friend buys fireworks when they really inexpensive, before the season and then sells them during the holidays where fireworks are popular (4<sup>th</sup> of July and New Year’s being the two best holidays). This gives him a boost of several thousand dollars a few times a year. He then takes those earnings and invests them to build a portfolio of passive income that he can later use. Income and investment opportunities are everywhere when you are looking for them.</p>\n<h4><strong>Be Patient</strong></h4>\n<p>While we get used to instant gratification, the best things in life take both our time and energy. They do not always work out like we planned but they are worth our time and effort because in the end they pay off. Investments are the same way. When looking for passive income streams be willing to look at the long term benefits and dedicate the time necessary to grow your investments in a strategic way.</p>\n<p>It is a lot less overwhelming to think in terms of establishing an income stream of $3,000 to $4,000 a month, than to think in terms of needing to save a million dollars for a comfortable retirement. Changing the way you look at investments might be just what you need to get started on your way to financial independence.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">Retirement Planning services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement/\">Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/you-only-live-once-retirement-goal/\">YOLO (You Only Live Once) so you Need a Retirement Goal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/your-401k-program/\">Your 401K Program: A Little Savings Now Goes a Long Way</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-much-money-do-you-need-for-retirement/\">How Much Money do you Need for Retirement These Days?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"fhttp://www.shermanwealth.com/benefits-saving-early-for-retirement/\">The Benefits of Saving Early for Retirement</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/advantages-of-participating-in-your-workplace-retirement-plan/\">Advantages of Participating in Your Workplace Retirement Plan</a></p>\n<p>LFS-1094765-011215</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Financial Independence has become the goal for many who struggle with the overwhelming task of funding a long term retirement strategy that is so far away.

Read these tips before you start Googling airfares to Thailand…</strong></h4>\n<p>Using a bonus or a raise to catch up in financial areas where you’ve fallen behind is a great way to jump start 2015. From paying off high interest debt to setting up a college savings plan, there are plenty of smart ways to put that chunk of change to good use.</p>\n<h4><strong>Pay off High Interest Loans</strong></h4>\n<p>It may feel impossible to escape the credit card damage you did in college or mounting loans. But you actually<em> can</em> make a dent in your debt by using your bonus for a large payment. This lowers your balance and minimizes some of those high interest charges moving forward. Get a snapshot of where you stand with the <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/debtrepayment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debt Repayment Calculator</a> from Credit Karma.</p>\n<h4><strong>Rebalance Your Investment Portfolio</strong></h4>\n<p>Those extra funds are a great reason to take a closer look at your assets and determine what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.<strong> </strong>We can help you adjust to create the right balance between return and risk, ensuring you&#8217;re pursing both long and short-term financial goals.</p>\n<h4><strong>Start a College Savings Plan </strong></h4>\n<p>Even if your kids are in diapers, it&#8217;s never too early to start saving for their college education. By starting early and using the variety of college savings programs available today, you can get a good head start on a college savings account.  There are a couple of different types of college savings savings plans and each has different features and potential tax benefits.    A financial advisor can help you determine the plan that suits your situation.  The <a href=\"http://www.collegesavings.org/gettingStarted.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">College Savings Plan Network</a> also offers great resources and tips for getting started.</p>\n<h4><strong>Think About Retiring</strong></h4>\n<p>Unless you received a<em> <strong>really</strong></em> enormous bonus, we don&#8217;t mean retire now. But if you haven&#8217;t reached your company&#8217;s 401(k) contribution limits, use your bonus to max out those weekly or monthly contributions. If your employer matches&#8230; consider that bonus doubled.</p>\n<h4><strong> Open an Investment Account</strong></h4>\n<p>Planning for the future can be daunting, especially when you have large expenses to deal with <em>now</em>. But the earlier you start investing <strong>(even low monthly contributions)</strong>, the longer your money has to grow.  Rather than let it sit in your checking account, create an investment account with your bonus to kick-start a financial safety net.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prep for an Emergency</strong></h4>\n<p>Fun? No. Smart? Yes. Unexpected issues pop up and can throw your monthly budget off track. Get prepared by setting up a fund for irregular expenses and circumstances like job loss, repairs, or costly medical bills for people and pets. A good rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses saved up for those worst-case scenarios.</p>\n<h4><strong>Save for a Rainy Day</strong></h4>\n<p>It may be tempting to book a trip somewhere warm or buy a TV that covers every square inch of your wall space. While it’s best to take care of outstanding debt and invest wisely, you deserve to have a little fun for burning the midnight oil at the office all year.

Having so many options available, how is an investor to choose which direction to go. For those who seek to understand, it can become paralysis by analysis, where the more you study, the more you realize you need to know. With all of its complexity, simple investment strategies can be very effective, if the right choices are made.</p>\n<h3><strong>Here are 5 Strategies most average investors don’t focus on, but should.</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Have a thought out strategy with a purpose</strong>. A common mistake of investors is to put money in an account without a lot of thought as to the goals you want to achieve. Starting an investment fund without goals is like driving in a car with no destination in mind. Without a purpose for the money, it is impossible to measure the success or failure of the investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start Early with a Time Horizon</strong>. Starting early gives your money more time to grow. The longer the money is invested, the better it can weather market fluctuations and the more likely you are to successfully reach your goals. Along these same lines, set specific goals around a time horizon. How long will each bucket of money be invested? This is a very important piece to your overall strategy because it will help evaluate the specific investments that will be most beneficial. If you are 15 years away from your goal, investment choices will be much different than if you are 5. The closer you get to the destination, the less able you are weather market fluctuations. This should be considered in your overall strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increase The Amount Invested Each Year</strong>. When looking over your investment strategy, separate the performance and the contributions. The performance is how much your money has grown through your investment strategies. Contributions are the dollar amount that you have added to your investment accounts. These two factors make up the total growth of your portfolio. Both of these numbers are important to your overall strategy. The account performance should be reviewed independent of contributions to help you stay on track with the right investment choices for your risk tolerance and time horizon. The amount you have added in contributions is what you have built into your budget for long term financial goals. When you increase those contributions each year, your account should grow significantly faster. Small increases are often not felt in the monthly budget.Let’s say you currently contribute <strong>6%</strong> from your paycheck into your <strong>401k</strong>. In addition to that you are putting $50 a month into your IRA and <strong>$50</strong> a month into a  college fund. At the beginning of the year, increase your 401k contribution by<strong> 1%</strong>. Now you are putting away<strong> 7%</strong> in pretax dollars for retirement. Then the next quarter increase your IRA contribution to <strong>$75</strong> a month and the quarter after that, increase your college fund contributions by <strong>$25</strong> a month. These small increments will barely be noticed in your monthly budget. The <strong>$25</strong> a month increase is less than <strong>$1</strong> a day. If you are earning <strong>$50,000</strong> a year, the<strong> 1% i</strong>ncrease with your 401k is only around $21 a paycheck if you get paid bi-monthly, in pretax dollars. Meaning your paycheck will be reduced by less than $20 a paycheck due to the pretax allocation. If you increase the contribution at the time of your annual raise, it will only be noticed in the form of larger investment accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review your asset allocation as a whole picture</strong>. When you have separate investments for different financial goals, it is more of a challenge to see your portfolio in a complete picture. Having investments with different companies can increase these challenges. When you have a 401k at a current job, and maybe one or two from previous jobs, they are more difficult to keep up with. Then you might have current investments for retirement, college and savings for your first home. Taking a holistic view of all your investments will help to ensure you have the best asset allocation possible. When your allocation gets out of whack, you might end up taking on more risk than you are comfortable with, without realizing it. It is not always possible to have all your investments under one roof, especially with a current 401k. However, including these investments in all financial reviews will help you stay on track for your overall investment goals as well as ensuring your asset allocation and risk profile are appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Understanding what you can control</strong>. In life we like to have control over our current and future destinations. Happiness and success often come from recognizing what we can control and focusing on that. Investing is no different. We cannot control the markets and we cannot control the economy. There is a host of circumstances and events that are outside of our control. Stressing and worrying about those things is not beneficial. You can control spending and investment rate. You can control which investments you choose and the amount of risk in your portfolio. Staying focused on these elements will lead to higher comfort levels which will encourage staying the course.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Financial investing success has more to do with implementing sound strategies, rather than luck or great market timing. It is more about staying the course, than picking the <strong>“hot”</strong> stock that will make you a millionaire.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/customized-financial-portfolio-construction/\">Investment Management services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">Tips for Millennials to Understanding the Stock Market</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dollar-cost-averaging/\">What is Dollar Cost Averaging?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-things-investors-get-wrong/\">5 Things Investors Get Wrong</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1082064-121814</strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>These simple strategies can make a big impact on your long term portfolio.

You work hard for your money and even losing money on paper, to market fluctuations, can make you want to put all your cash under the mattress. In reality most investments will have volatility. Fixed rate products like CD’s may not have volatility, but will have their own risk of not keeping up with inflation. Currently 1 year CD’s are paying around 1%, and 5 year CD’s are only paying around 2%, according to <a href=\"Bankrate.com\">Bankrate</a>. This makes it necessary to have investments in your portfolio, which will fluctuate in value, in order to potentially have the needed funds to pursue your financial goals.</p>\n<p>With inflation averaging <strong>3.22%</strong> per year from 1913 to 2013², it is easy to see that establishing an investment portfolio that provides higher returns than inflation is essential to any long term plan. Investors look to mitigate the risk of the volatile markets, while seeking a return that will build investment values.</p>\n<p>For all its Bull and Bear markets, runs and crashes, stock market investments in the last 100 years has been positive when looking at any 10 year period from 1903 to December 1912³. The average stock market return since 1932 is around <strong>7%</strong> and when inflation is taken into account the average return is over <strong>10%</strong>⁴. So while the markets do go up and down on a daily basis, the overall market pattern has a consistent upward trend. However, past performance is not indicative of future results and your investments selection(s) and time horizon will affect your results.</p>\n<h3>Investing With Your Risk Tolerance in Mind</h3>\n<p>Investment risk, by definition, is the likelihood of losses in relation to an expected rate of return for a specific investment. All investments have some investment risk. The challenge for you is to determine which investments have risks you are willing to accept, and may be potentially rewarded with higher returns on a consistent enough basis.</p>\n<p>This is where a Sherman Wealth Management financial professional comes in. They work with you to determine a level of risk that is suitable for you and provide the potential growth needed to pursue your financial objectives. This requires not only understanding specific investments but also having a good pulse on what you, as an investor, need.</p>\n<p>In order to give the best advice, it is necessary to truly understand the client’s needs. Just asking, how much risk are you comfortable with, is not enough. Educating and teaching you about risk and what it may mean for your future, is the goal. This allows you to select investments that reflect your risk tolerance and financial aspirations.</p>\n<p>Taking a high level of personal interest in the changing needs of our clients is our goal. We believe this is the best strategy for maintaining an investment portfolio that is designed to have the appropriate amount of risk to pursue your financial goals, while striving to minimize the risk taken on individual investment choices.</p>\n<p>Each investor has individual needs and no investor’s taste for risk is the same. You need recommendations that take all of your circumstances and life goals into account. Added risk might lead to higher returns, but not always.</p>\n<p>If you have a lower tolerance for risk, building an investment portfolio that is designed to withstand market turmoil is more appropriate. These strategies still experience ups and downs, but the right blend of investments potentially moderate the fluctuations to align with your tolerance for risk.</p>\n<p>The stock market offers investments that carry various levels of risk. There are value, dividend paying stocks that have a lower volatility than emerging small cap stocks. Bonds are also available at various risk levels, allowing you to manage risk and performance within the portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Asset Allocation for Mitigating Volatility</h3>\n<p>Another method to help mitigate market risk and volatility is through Asset Allocation. This is the process of using several asset classes within an investment portfolio by apportioning a portfolio’s assets according to the individual goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stock market investments have the general categories of stocks and bonds.</p>\n<p>Stocks are broken down further between value stocks and growth stocks, with value generally being more conservative. Stocks that pay dividends are usually more conservative than stocks that do not, because investors are getting some return while they still hold the position. Stocks are also broken down by company size. These are denoted as large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks. Large cap stocks include companies like Microsoft, Apple, Bank of America and national names we all recognize. Small cap companies are those with 300 million to 2 billion in revenue, and mid-caps are between these two. The last large category is US companies and International or global companies.</p>\n<p>Bonds are rated much like individual credit is rated. There are consumers that are a much lower risk than others and this is measured through individual credit scores. Bonds operate in a similar way. There are independent credit agencies like<strong> S&amp;P</strong> and, Moody’s which rate company bond offerings. Bond ratings are expressed as letters ranging from &#8216;<strong>AAA</strong>&#8216;, which is the highest grade, to &#8216;C&#8217; (&#8220;<strong>junk</strong>&#8220;), which is the lowest grade. Different rating services use the same letter grades, but use various combinations of upper- and lower-case letters to differentiate themselves. Lower ratings represent higher default risk and thus higher interest rates to investors.</p>\n<p>Selecting the best mix of stocks and bonds is a delicate balance. Spreading your investments choices across different categories may provide an effective way to reduce the overall volatility of a portfolio. As the market fluctuates not all stocks and bonds move up and down at the same rate or the same time. When asset allocation is used correctly there is a designed buffer against losses and the overall risk of the portfolio should be reduced.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages of Dollar Cost Averaging</strong></p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed dollar amount on a regular schedule, regardless of the actual price of the stock, bond or other investment vehicle. There are several advantages to using this strategy.</p>\n<p>Smaller amounts can be invested providing potential benefits of growth over time. Time in the market is much more important than market timing and dollar cost averaging gets you in the market on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Buying more shares when the stock has a lower price and less shares when the price is higher. . Even the best companies will see stock prices fluctuate based on a current news reports, events that impacts the industry, or seasonal fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging helps reduce the risk of the overall portfolio because you are investing at regular intervals and buying more shares when the prices are low. This can be an effective way to grow your portfolio. Studies have shown that those who invest in regular intervals are more consistent with their investments, providing better overall growth, according to Morningstar⁵.</p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.</p>\n<p>Financial strategies require a long term strategy. As such, volatility must be considered in your investment choices. Avoiding volatility because of fear can result in negative returns, when adding the impact of inflation. Working with a financial professional who understands volatility and uses strategies designed to enable you to build a portfolio which is suitable to your risk tolerance.

There are three major ways in which men and women differ when it comes to behavioral investing.</p>\n<p><strong>Investment Goals and Strategies:</strong> According to the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/\">Wall Street Journal</a>, finance professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, women tend to focus more on longer-term, non-monetary goals. Women generally associate money with security, independence and the quality of their life and their families’ lives. Women have a <strong>‘safety first’</strong> mentality. Generally speaking, women are more inclined than men to wear seat belts, avoid cigarette smoking, floss and brush their teeth and make regular doctor visits. They even have been shown to be<strong> 40%</strong> less prone than men to run yellow traffic lights. Men, on the other hand, who tend to be more competitive and thrill-seeking by nature, often focus on the short-term track records of their portfolios, incurring larger overall returns, and tend to be more risk tolerant. In contrast, women tend to be more averse to risk and are more skeptical. When it comes to investing and planning for their future, women shy away from uncertainty and will take a longer time to make investment decisions, are more methodical in how they go about research, and ask more questions.</p>\n<p>Both men and women should make sure that their investment styles and horizons match their overall financial goals. For women, this may mean taking on more risk. As they become more familiar and understand the ups and down of the stock market they will naturally become more risk tolerant. For men, this may mean focusing more on longer-horizon goals, rather than on short-term trading track records and larger gains.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_307\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-307\" style=\"width: 245px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-307 size-medium\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Women-Risk-Averse-1-245x300.png\" alt=\"Women Risk Averse\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-307\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prudential&#8217;s study Financial Experience &amp; Behaviors Among Women</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Learning Curve: </strong>A 2012-2013 Prudential study on women investors reveals that women are more receptive to financial research and advice than men. Women seek help more often. Men tend to enjoy learning on their own and take a more independent approach, like the internet,  while women prefer learning in a group setting. Women rely more on personal networks with friends, family, financial planners, and they take a networking approach to gathering information. They often require more of a financial advisor’s time and resources, but are looking for a trusted relationship to be established, one  they can rely on long term. Men, however,  prefer to teach themselves and are more self-directed learners, using the Internet (more often than women) to gather information and are more likely to claim they understand financial matters than women. In actuality,  knowledge levels are not high for either gender.</p>\n<p>Thus far, evidence does not support, however, whether one source of information or learning technique is more or less effective than another.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_311\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-311\" style=\"width: 957px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-311 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Information-Sources-Used-By-Men-Vs-Women-1.png\" alt=\"Information Sources Used By Men Vs Women\" width=\"957\" height=\"432\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-311\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Source: Women &amp; Investing, Gender differences in investment behavior. FINRA Report August 2006</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Confidence Factor:</strong> Women tend to be thorough and take more time to make decisions than men. Several studies, including a national survey by LPL Financial, show that women tend to research investments in depth before making portfolio decisions, and the process, as a result, tends to take more time. Women also tend to be more patient as investors and consult their advisors before adjusting their portfolio positioning, whereas men are more prone to market timing impulses. Men veer toward overconfidence while women lean towards indecisiveness and insecurity.</p>\n<p>Overconfidence can lead to taking too much risk. While women risk missing out on some investment opportunities in taking more time to make decisions, men’s generally higher impatience when it comes to seeing investment returns makes them more likely to attempt market timing, and prone to loss when the timing is off. Women are less afflicted than men by overconfidence, or the delusion that they know more than they really do and are more likely (than men) to attribute success to factors outside themselves, like luck or fate.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-318 size-large\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ledbury-Research-1-1024x255.png\" alt=\"Ledbury Research\" width=\"980\" height=\"244\" /></p>\n<p>Yet, taking too little risk, due to lack of confidence, can hurt your investment goals just as much as overconfidence. When it comes to investing for the long term, taking risk is not a luxury. Insecure investors can confine their results by investing too conservatively, nearly as much as their overeager counterparts could do by excessive trading and risk-taking.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, to help avoid rash decisions and market impulses, men may benefit from implementing a systematic investment strategy and a periodic, rather than continuous, review of their accounts and rebalancing. They may want to consider becoming even more open to professional financial advice. Women may also want to review the efficiency of their investment allocations across their portfolios to counter the negative impact of mental accounting. In addition, they may want to consider attending financial education seminars to help boost their confidence levels and ability to make timely, well-informed investment decisions.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_321\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-321\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-321 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Men-Vs-Women-Confidence-Level-1.png\" alt=\"Men Vs Women Confidence Level\" width=\"915\" height=\"415\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Women &amp; Investing, Gender differences in investment behavior.

Whether it’s the acronym, <strong>#YOLO</strong> (You only live once) or the older, maybe not-so-cool phrase, ‘Carpe Diem,’ we are constantly reminded that we should stop worrying about the future and focus on today. But when it comes to your finances, is society sending us a detrimental message?</p>\n<p>When addressing one’s plans for retirement, it is sometimes difficult to find a happy medium between the avoidance of financial responsibilities and the overwhelming, anxiety-inducing worry over one’s financial future. Below are two very common thought processes that I see often.</p>\n<p><strong>1) I am not worried about the future now, I’ll deal with it later</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our day-to-day pressing needs and our live-for-today goals become the priority and we cannot focus on or visualize what is not right in front of us. We tell ourselves, ‘I’ll do it tomorrow.’ Whether it’s not participating in a 401K because the extra monthly money is needed for utility bills or prolonging the start of a college savings fund for your child because you have mortgage payments to make, you are setting yourself up for a worrisome retirement.</p>\n<p>It is important that you stop and visualize, in vivid detail, a big retirement goal. Are you visualizing being able to enjoy the finer things in life or are you just hoping to maintain the lifestyle that you are living today? What details do you see when you make this visualization?</p>\n<p>Consider these important factors while you are visualizing:</p>\n<p><strong><em>If I continue at today’s rate-of-saving, what will my savings be at retirement?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I have children? Do I plan to have more children?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I plan to send my children to college?/Can I afford college tuition?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I own a home? Do I have a mortgage?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Have I planned for rising health concerns as I get older?</em></strong></p>\n<p>If something should happen to me, will my family be taken care of?/What kind of debt will they incur?</p>\n<p><strong>2.) I worry so much about my future financial position, that I sacrifice my daily happiness</strong></p>\n<p>Studies have shown that intense worrying about money or financial situations can affect many aspects of your life from mental health, to relationships, to career. When consumed with worry over your finances, it can inflict on your ability to focus thus creating a distraction and inability to enjoy the present.</p>\n<p>While it is important to plan for the future, it should not be so overwhelming that it interferes with one’s day-to-day abilities. Ask yourself:</p>\n<p><em><strong>What am I really worried about?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Is it something in my control? If so, am I taking the necessary steps?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>If it is not in my control, what steps can I take to ease my anxiety?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Do I have a financial advisor that can help to address financial concerns and alleviate unnecessary worry?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Whether you identify more with the first or second way of approaching your finances, or possibly somewhere in the middle, it is important to address your financial concerns with a trusted financial advisor. Unnecessary worry can cause you to feel paralyzed, out of control, and unable to make the right financial decisions concerning your retirement. However, failing to address future financial responsibilities, and avoidance altogether, can prove to be counterintuitive, creating anxiety and worry at a later date. Suddenly financial responsibilities show up at your door and you no longer have the option to ignore or put off. In taking small steps along the way, you can gain control of both your finances and your worry.</p>\n<p>Call Brad Sherman at <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Sherman Wealth Management</a> today and set up a no-cost financial consultation.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">Retirement Planning services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement/\">Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/finding-financial-independence/\">Finding Financial Independence</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/your-401k-program/\">Your 401K Program: A Little Savings Now Goes a Long Way</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-much-money-do-you-need-for-retirement/\">How Much Money do you Need for Retirement These Days?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"fhttp://www.shermanwealth.com/benefits-saving-early-for-retirement/\">The Benefits of Saving Early for Retirement</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/advantages-of-participating-in-your-workplace-retirement-plan/\">Advantages of Participating in Your Workplace Retirement Plan</a></p>\n<p>LFS-926223-051514</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>When you read through blogs or scroll through hashtags and memes on social media, there is a recurrent theme among millennials regarding the live-for-today sentiment.

In this same survey – the Envestnet Fiduciary Standards Study – 52 percent of investors did not believe that all financial advisors were bound to a standard requiring them to act in the client’s best interest. In the post-Great Recession era, these findings are exceedingly troublesome.</p>\n<p>Brad Sherman, president of Sherman Wealth Management, serving clients in the greater Washington, D.C. metro area, has built his practice around improving those statistics.</p>\n<p>Sherman is a big believer in full disclosure and complete transparency for his clients regarding his fees and how he works with their accounts. He’s also a big believer in total transparency from the client. “For the relationship to fully benefit the client, there has to be transparency on both sides of it,” Sherman said. “I have to provide a completely transparent structure so everyone knows what they are paying for what they are receiving – so that there are not any surprises to the client. On the other hand, the client has to fully disclose to me what their financial situation and goals are so I can make appropriate recommendations for them.”</p>\n<p>He doesn’t have a firm minimum for his clients and in reality, most of his clients wouldn’t fit into the advisor marketplace niche requiring a quarter of a million to start. The bulk of his clients are his peers – people ranging in age from 25 to 40ish – who are starting careers, marriages and families. They are at the beginning of the accumulation phase of savings plans and many are buying their first homes.</p>\n<p>“They are comfortable with me and with taking my advice, because I either have been just recently in the same situation or am still doing the same things they are,” Sherman said.</p>\n<p>He started Sherman Wealth Management in January 2013 after spending 12 years working in financial services for other firms. He also had just completed his master’s degree in quantitative finance from American University, and it seemed like the appropriate time to hang out his own shingle. Since then, Sherman has taken on 50 clients and and wishes to develop relationships with additional clients seeking affordable, tax-efficient and customized advice.</p>\n<p>Sherman said that his decision to become a registered representative with Lincoln Financial Securities Corporation Member SIPC gives him the flexibility to craft portfolios specifically matching the individual needs and goals of each client.</p>\n<p>“Not all clients are the same,” he said. “That is why we customize every solution. Some of the bigger companies get into trouble by putting people into cookie cutter molds that may not be right for them. By representing Lincoln Financial in a fee-based model, there is no pressure on me to sell something that is not suitable for any of my clients.”</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Financial Advisor services.</a></p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/money-conversation/\">Having the Money Conversation</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/top-10-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">Top 10 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</a></p>\n<p>LFS-949357-061714</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>According to a recent survey, only 40 percent of investors indicated that their financial advisor(s) clearly explained how they are compensated.

It’s the number that seems to follow you wherever you go and rears itself way more often than your SAT scores or your IQ score. While it’s something you may not think about often, it is always there. So you should be always be thinking about how to maximize your credit score. Your credit is a doorway to many aspects of your life. And if its not where it should be, those doors may remain locked.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Your Credit Score is important</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>With a higher credit score, you will be able to take advantage of lower interest on loans, pay less for credit, better deals on services and insurance and the opportunity to obtain better jobs and living spaces. Essentially, the higher your credit score, the less obstacles you will face in your day-to-day life.</li>\n<li>Renting or buying a home First things first, you need a place to live, right? Well, before you rent, a landlord will often pull your credit report before allowing you to sign a lease. If you are looking to buy and need a bank loan, mortgage lenders will not only run your credit report, but will put a great emphasis on it in order to protect themselves from possible default. You will also need insurance on your home. Insurance companies are likely to check your credit score to predict the likelihood of you filing insurance claims. Your credit score can affect your eligibility and your rates.</li>\n<li>Setting up utility accounts Once you have moved, now what? You need a phone, right? And cable? Well, what about electricity, garbage collection, and water? Yes, these are all accounts you will need to establish. If your credit score comes back too low, the utility companies may require a deposit in advance, or even a co-signer.</li>\n<li>Finding a job In some states, employers are allowed to pull credit reports. Although they need your consent, wouldn’t it take some of the pressure off of the interview process and finding employment if you knew your credit score was at a decent level?</li>\n<li>Financing a car Leasing a car is similar to leasing an apartment. Lenders want to be sure you will be able to pay your monthly bill. Not only will your credit report be checked for the lease, but also, again, for the auto insurance.</li>\n<li>Opening credit cards You are planning an upcoming vacation and want to open a credit card that allows you to earn miles. If your credit score is not up-to-par, most likely you will not be offered credit cards with these types of perks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours</strong></p>\n<p>There are different ranges of credit scores based on a mathematical equation that analyzes your credit reports which include factors like payment history, debt levels, age of accounts, income etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Typical Credit Score rankings</strong>: <em>Excellent: 750 plus Good: 700-749 Fair: 650-699 Poor: 600-649 Bad: 599 and below</em></p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s how to maximize your Credit Score</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay bills on time This is important. If you are late on your payments, not only will your credit score go down, but you will also most likely pay an unnecessary late fee which just adds to your debt balance</li>\n<li>Pay more than just the minimum When you pay only the minimum, you are only paying the interest instead of paying down the debt balance. Creditors notice this. If you are unable to make payments that are larger than the interest, look for balance transfer offers from other creditors that may allow you to roll your balance over (for a minimal fee-usually 3%) in order to receive a zero percent APR for a set period of time (usually 6 months to a year). That will hopefully give you the opportunity to pay down the balance. (the pros and cons of balance transfers will be another blog post at a later date)</li>\n<li>Apply for credit cards in moderation Although balance transfers are a possible option, make sure you don’t open too many credit cards at once. If you have balances on too many and continue to look for more, lenders will think you are credit-hungry and are a candidate for possible default.</li>\n<li>Keep your credit card balance at 20% of the available credit or lower The lower the better.</li>\n<li>Don’t close credit cards If you have paid off a credit card balance, do not close the account. A zero balance on the card will help boost your credit score. It shows good payment history and can help your debt ratio. And never close a card with an existing balance, as it will just drive your current score down.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-budgeting-and-saving/\">Budgeting and Savings planning</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/save-money-pay-debt/\">Save Money or Pay Down Debt</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LFS950937061914</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Ok, while it may not be the most romantic pick-up line, there is something to be said for wanting to know a potential partner’s credit score.

However, Millennials are anything but when it comes to their finances. According to Financial Finesse 2013 Generational Research Report, the tech savvy Millennials “continue to be stronger than their older Generation X counterparts in many areas of day to day money management.”</p>\n<p>Those under 30, commonly labeled the Millennial Generation, are doing a relatively good job managing their current cash flow on a day to day basis. In the age of the internet and now social media, technology is the leg up for Millennials. Accustomed to budget friendly websites, comparison shopping, and peer comparison, Millennials use what they have at their fingertips to do their own research and ensure they are getting the best deals. So when it comes to short term cash flow, Millennials’ top priority is making sure they have more money coming in than going out.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the availability of parental support from the baby boomers (ages 45-65) has steadily increased in recent years, as 30% of young adults (ages 18 to 34) that are employed full time live with their parents or have moved back home temporarily. Thus giving Millennials extra time to build savings.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Strengths</strong></p>\n<p>73% have a handle on cash flow<br />\n88% are paying their bills on time each month<br />\n62% are regularly paying off their credit card balances in full<br />\n52% check their credit rating on an annual basis.</p>\n<p>However, although Millennials may not be sitting on the same amount of debt as their older counterparts, they tend to overlook a long term perspective that makes planning for retirement a top priority. According to the same Financial Finesse study, Millennials “suffer from a relative lack of investment knowledge” making long term financial goals their biggest challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Weaknesses</strong></p>\n<p>Only 67% say they have a general knowledge about investments<br />\nOnly 37% have taken a risk tolerance assessment<br />\nOnly 29% rebalance their investments<br />\nOnly 83% are contributing to their retirement plan at work<br />\nOnly 29% have run a retirement projection<br />\nOnly 17% say they are on track to replace 80% of their income in retirement<br />\nOnly 26% contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA<br />\nOnly 29% are confident their investments are allocated appropriately</p>\n<p>To get Millennials on track, they need to bring their long‐term goals into focus. This generation favors the opinions and advice of peers and first‐hand users over those of traditional experts. Seventy‐five percent have created a profile on a social network and are more likely than any other generation to visit the website several times a day. Finding a way to incorporate a social platform with an educational platform allowing Millennials to share their experiences, with hands‐on applications, as well as testimonials and peer recommendations, will resonate well with this generation as they believe the classroom is a thing of the past. Thirty-nine percent of Millennials see the future of education as more virtual.</p>\n<p>Gen X</p>\n<p>Generation X, ages 30-44, is considered the more self-reliant generation. They are the first generation to grow up with both parents working outside the home and have had independence and freedom at a young age compared to other generations. That, coupled with being the first generation to grow up with computers, has given Gen X the ability, as well as the need, to control their own lives, including their financial goals.</p>\n<p>Gen Xers, on average, have a higher income than their younger counterparts and tend to be homeowners and/or married with a dual household income. However, this generation was hit the hardest by the Great Recession, losing quite a bit of their savings, most significantly when the housing market collapsed. This creates a struggle for Gen X in prioritizing their financial responsibilities. This group is paying down debt from their self-reliant 20’s but with more immediate obligations, such as mortgage payments and young children, it becomes difficult to balance. Those more immediate expenses tend to seek priority over their day to day cash flow.</p>\n<p>What holds Gen X back is not their desire to save, but rather their debt that hangs on them like a noose around their necks. Forty-nine percent have debt that keeps them from saving for emergencies, children’s college tuition and ultimately retirement.</p>\n<p>During the financial crisis: *</p>\n<p>15% of Generation X made early withdrawals from their retirement accounts<br />\n23% stopped contributing to those retirement accounts<br />\n22% stopped contributing to college accounts</p>\n<p>* 2012 report by the Insured Retirement Institute.</p>\n<p>It may help Generation X to be aware of the vast number of available college financing options. Those options make saving for college a lower priority than saving for their own goals like retirement, an emergency fund, and of course, paying off debt. It is important they learn to balance competing demands and meet long term goals while faced with immediate growing priorities.</p>\n<p>Gen X’ers rely heavily on education and take advantage of tools that are made available to them. One tool this age group has taken advantage of, and had a high level of confidence in, is the stock market, which may be why they are struggling to meet their long term goals. Many Gen X’ers largely missed the huge run up in stock prices in the 80’s and 90’s, and may need more aggressive retirement investment strategies or alternatives to compensate. They understand the importance of investing and are not afraid to do so aggressively.</p>\n<h3>Both generations need to be realistic about their finances</h3>\n<p>Both generations view “old age” at somewhere around 78 or 80 and the life expectancy of a current 60 year old, according to government statistics, has reached a record 84 years. But with both Gen Xers and Millennials facing the impending shortfalls of Medicare and Social Security, how will either generation prepare accordingly? This, combined with the reduction in employer‐sponsored retirement benefits, makes both groups subject to suffer shortfalls in their own savings unless drastic measures are taken.</p>\n<p>Both generations have had some help from the Baby Boomers along the way—whether through life insurance, college savings or financial support post college. But are either the Millennials or Gen X’ers going to have the ability to do the same for their own children?</p>\n<p>Although Gen X may not have as much time as Millennials for their savings to compound and grow, the silver lining is both generations have time on their side. But time is money, right?

When it comes to saving for retirement, there are few better ways than a workplace plan such as a 401(K). Yet, there are a few common excuses for not opting into an employer compensation plan.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">● There will always be Social Security<br />\n● I can’t afford it right now. I’m not making enough money to save yet.<br />\n● Fear of losing money in bad investments.<br />\n● I’m so young, I have all the time in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>The 411 about the 401(K)</strong><br />\nA 401K allows employees to withdraw money from their paycheck prior to taxes and invest it in a retirement savings plan. Many employers then match the contributions proportionately, sometimes even dollar for dollar. The contributions are not taxed until the money is withdrawn. As of 2014, you can contribute up to $17,500 per year.</p>\n<p>Funds withdrawn prior to age 59 ½ are subject to a 10% penalty and are taxed as current income in the year withdrawn.</p>\n<p><strong>A Mini History Lesson about Pensions and Employer Compensation Plans</strong><br />\nIt was during the American Revolution, that what we know as a pension, came about. The Continental Congress offered soldiers a monthly lifetime income as an incentive to join General Washington’s army.The income they’d receive when the war was over would be a payment for their service.This lifetime income was called a pension.The offer was repeated by the federal government the during the Civil War and has continued ever since.</p>\n<p>The first private company to offer a pension plan was American Express in 1875. They gave an income to each retired employee. The amount was equal to half of the worker’s annual pay, based on an average of the worker’s final ten years of employment (up to $500 annually). Over the next 50 years, hundreds of other companies created similar plans. (However, now it’s based on the average of the worker’s highest paid income of 35 years!)</p>\n<p>The end of 1929 brought the Great Depression. Millions of people became unemployed which created fierce competition for jobs.The nation’s economy at the time was agricultural and industrial— both very physically demanding— placing older Americans at a distinct disadvantage. So when older employees lost their jobs, they were unlikely to find new ones and found themselves involuntarily retired.</p>\n<p>Thus, in 1935 came the Social Security Act which was signed by President Roosevelt,establishing the first public retirement plan and a national retirement age of 65.Similar to the private plan created by American Express, Social Security was to pay monthly benefits based on each worker’s length of service and average annual salary.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong>Addressing the Excuses</strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong><em>There will always be Social Security<br />\n</em></strong>When the Social Security Act was established, the average American lifespan was 61.7 years, however, today it is 78 years. Now, one must plan income for retirement to get you to age 100 or beyond. You can no longer solely rely on Social Security alone to maintain you through your retirement years. It should only provide you with one-third of your retirement income.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">Few companies still maintain traditional pensions (paid for by employers). In this day and age, people are no longer staying at one place of employment for their entire career which is usually the case in which a pension would still exist. The vast majority of today’s retirement plans fall under “defined contribution plans” such as the 401(K).</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong><em>I can’t afford it right now. I’m not making enough money to save yet.<br />\n</em></strong>You do not have to make a lot of money to participate in this program. Typically an employer only requires 1-2% of the participant’s salary. On a $50K salary, that is only $42 to $84 per month. And remember, your employer may contribute proportionately every time you do. How much do you spend on your cable bill? Or phone bill? Or your gym?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">Your employer automatically deducts your contributions every time you are paid. If you don’t see the money, it won’t be so hard to part with it! Most of the legwork to provide investment options is done by your employer and the professional advisers they hire to assist them. An increasing number of plans offer “auto enroll” and “auto escalate” features. The first automatically signs you up for your retirement plan; the second automatically boosts contributions as your salary increases.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">Another perk: You get two tax advantages when you save in a 401(K) plan. First, your contributions are tax-deductible. Second, the money you contribute doesn’t count toward your gross income for the year, lowering your taxable income. There are also no taxes on interest or dividends at the end of the year like in a non qualified investment or savings. Say you put 10% of your $50,000 salary into your account each month. That’s $416 you don’t have to pay tax on. If you’re single, that translates to about $104 in monthly tax savings, or $1,245 a year and tax deferred until its withdrawn.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong><em>Fear of losing money in bad investments.<br />\n</em></strong>Sometimes taking your hard earned money and putting it where you can’t see it is scary. People who have fear of going to the doctor but have to go anyway. Think of it the same way. Most 401(k)s let the employee choose where to invest their savings from a variety of options ranging from aggressive choices as to less volatile choices.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><em><strong>I’m so young, I have all the time in the world.<br />\n</strong></em>The key to success of a 401(K) is to start as early as possible and to try and contribute the maximum allowed. According to FinancialSamurai.com, in 2014, if a 22 year old started participating in a 401(K) by the time they are 65, they will have saved $743K to $3.5 million, depending on the percentage of contributions to the plan. But if someone does not start contributing until age 40, by the time they are 65, they will have saved $305.5K to $550K, depending on the percentage of contributions to the plan. Wouldn’t you prefer to be the former?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong>Don’t leave money on the table. If your company offers a 401(K), find out the details of the plan and </strong><strong>consider taking advantage today</strong>.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">Retirement Planning services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement/\">Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/finding-financial-independence/\">Finding Financial Independence</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/you-only-live-once-retirement-goal/\">YOLO (You Only Live Once) so you Need a Retirement Goal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/your-401k-program/\">Your 401K Program: A Little Savings Now Goes a Long Way</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-much-money-do-you-need-for-retirement/\">How Much Money do you Need for Retirement These Days?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"fhttp://www.shermanwealth.com/benefits-saving-early-for-retirement/\">The Benefits of Saving Early for Retirement</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">LFS­946221­061214</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>As young adults, 20 and 30-year-old’s tend to procrastinate when it comes to saving for retirement, thinking they have all the time in the world.But the key is to start now.
