You have multiple options when hiring someone, but all of those options can have big drawbacks:</p>\n<p>We’ve built our business differently. We want you to get good-quality financial advice at a price that makes sense. That’s why we don’t require investment minimums or routine maintenance fees common to other firms, and as a fee-only registered investment advisory firm, we don’t receive commissions. Instead, we charge solely by a percentage of the assets we manage for you. As fiduciaries, we are legally bound to place your interests ahead of our own. That means you can be confident that our advice really is conflict-free and intended for your benefit.</p>\n<p>Everything we do at Sherman Wealth Management is customized for you. That means your investment portfolio isn’t managed by computer software or some arbitrary demographic formula, but by experienced advisors who keep your individual needs, goals and risk tolerance in mind. To minimize fees, we incorporate <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dimensional-fund-advising/\">Dimensional Funds</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/about-etf-exchange-traded-funds/\">ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)</a> in our investment portfolios.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we want a relationship with you.  Some firms will run your plan through financial software and then check back with you in six months. We understand that real life doesn’t work like that. Whether you need a detailed financial plan or just some financial advice to help you make an important decision, we are here help. And because we understand that your life is busy, we use technology strategically, making it easy for you to start working with us and tracking your progress in the years to come. Bettering your life is what we are about.</p>\n<p>\t<a href=\"http://www.meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><br />\n\t\t\t\tSchedule a Free Introductory Call<br />\n\t\t\t</a></p>\n","template":"","acf":null}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"investment-philosophy","template":"","rootQuery":"\n  query PageQuery($slug: String!) {\n    wordpressPage(slug: { eq: $slug }) {\n      title\n      slug\n      content\n      template\n      acf {\n        content_blocks_page{\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_intro_section {\n            intro_text\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_regular_content {\n            content_text\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_two_columns {\n            two_columns {\n              column_left\n              column_right\n            }\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_three_columns {\n            three_columns_block {\n              column_left\n              column_middle\n              column_right\n            }\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_four_columns {\n            four_columns_block {\n              column_left\n              column_middle_left\n              column_middle_right\n              column_right\n            }\n            id\n          }\n          __typename\n          ... on WordPressAcf_featured_content {\n            featured_content_block {\n              content\n              image {\n                source_url\n                id\n              }\n            }\n            id\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n"}}}
