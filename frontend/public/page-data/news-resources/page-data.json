If you or your household received a check, here are some things you may want to consider doing with it.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>#1: Cover the Essentials</b></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stimulus checks are designed to help Americans who may be financially struggling due to COVID-19. Whether you’ve been furloughed, forced to reduce hours or dragging financially, you should use this money to cover any immediate, essential expenses like rent, utilities, groceries or internet.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This check should be looked at as a mini emergency fund. Look at your bills over the coming weeks and determine how you can best utilize these funds. If you’re currently receiving unemployment payments from the government, remember to account for this income when making your financial strategy as well. If you are still coming up short after the stimulus check has been used up, remember to check with companies (power companies, insurers, gyms, cable companies, etc.) regarding any relief efforts or forgiveness policies they may have enacted amidst the global pandemic.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>#2: Fill Your Emergency Fund</b></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many adults say they don’t have enough saved to cover a $400 emergency.</span><em><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></sup></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  With so many people living paycheck to paycheck, this extra bump in funds could be the cushion needed to prepare for any potential financial surprises.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your income remains unaffected by the pandemic or you find yourself with some additional dollars leftover, it’s never a bad idea to tuck some away for a rainy day. If you don’t have an emergency fund, saving any surplus from your stimulus check is a good way to start one. An ideal emergency fund should have three to six months’ salary to help cover unexpected expenses such as job loss, medical bills, home damage, car repairs, etc. </span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>#3: Address High-Interest Debt</b></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total household debt in America was already quite high before the pandemic hit.  Now, overall American debt is soaring. While some of these debts include lower-interest debts like auto loans or student loans, an extremely large portion of the overall amount is attributed to credit card debt.</span><em><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3</span></sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re currently facing any amount of high-interest debt, such as credit cards or personal loans, paying this down should be a top financial priority. If your current financial situation allows it, use your stimulus check to make a dent in (or pay off completely) any high-interest debt your family may have.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>#4: Support Local Businesses</b></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is extremely important to patronize local shops in your community if you are able to. Whether you order food from a local restaurant, purchase gift cards from your favorite boutique or frequent your local coffee shop or bakery for take-out, small business owners have been some of the hardest hit during these times. Many of these small businesses don’t have the backing of a larger corporation or franchise and are experiencing a severe drop in revenue that could jeopardize their ability to stay open after the pandemic.  Your patronage could make a big difference in their ability to continue operation.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>#5: Donate It</b></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are fortunate enough to be financially comfortable during the COVID-19 pandemic, you may want to consider giving to those most affected &#8211; medical facilities, food banks, shelters, etc. The devastating impact of COVID-19 means assistance is needed now more than ever before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the ability to make physical donations (such as clothing, toys, pantry items, etc.) may be limited right now, you can still use your stimulus check to provide crucial monetary relief.   You can search for charity organizations using tools such as </span><a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charity Navigator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"http://give.org/charity-reviews/national\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Better Business Bureau’s Giving Alliance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or you may hear about local nonprofits that are in need through social media or word of mouth.  </span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>#6: Fund Your Future Retirement</b></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you are far off from retirement, putting any excess income into a retirement savings account can be a rewarding move. You may consider using your stimulus check to pad your IRA or 401(k) if you are able. The power of compounding interest means that $1,200 could turn into a couple thousand or more by the time retirement rolls around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these unprecedented times, many of us are left wondering what the best next move is when it comes to our stimulus checks. No matter what you choose to do, remember to be intentional with these additional dollars.

This virus has spread throughout the globe and as many businesses are forced to cease operation, people worldwide are losing jobs at record rates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roughly 22 million Americans filed unemployment claims over a four-week period starting March 14 &#8211; marking a record-breaking high for the U.S. Department of Labor.</span><em><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1</span></sup></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These numbers are unprecedented as everyone everywhere struggles to make ends meet amidst this widespread pandemic.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those struggling financially, how do we begin recovering from this? Here are some critical next steps for those impacted by the first-hand economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>\n<h5><em><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step #1: Reevaluate Your Spending</span> </b></em></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you suddenly have a stop in income, a decrease in your paycheck or you’re now reliant on financial assistance from the government, any change in your normal cash flow is a reason to look at your spending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though it may seem obvious, it should be done immediately and with care. You should look over your weekly or monthly budget to determine any non-essential costs that can be eliminated. Since many businesses you may have frequented are likely not open anyway, you should consider reallocating any money normally budgeted for this to cover other necessary expenses.  Any money that may have been budgeted for a night out at a restaurant or a movie ticket could be used to start or contribute to an emergency fund instead.</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><b>Step #2: Acknowledge the Change</b></em></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These times are unprecedented and are affecting the lives of nearly everyone across the globe. We are all fighting the spread of a deadly virus while people in a wide variety of industries &#8211; hospitality, retail, food, travel and more &#8211; have been left jobless for the foreseeable future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our current circumstances are likely to have made many stressed, angry, sad and devastated emotionally. When it comes to standing tall and moving forward financially, the sooner you can recognize the emotional toll these global events have had and come to terms with the “new normal,” the sooner you can begin planning ahead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of this acceptance is recognizing any bad habits you might have, specifically financial spending habits triggered by stress. If you like to “take the edge off” with online shopping or use eating out as a way to cheer yourself up, now is a good time to practice restraint.  When you become aware that these are emotional responses, you can try to come up with other ways this money may be better spent, such as paying off debt, putting it into savings or creating an emergency fund.  </span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><b>Step #3: Be Aware of Changing Policies</b></em></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both federal and state governments have been working hard to accommodate out-of-work citizens. Legislation has been passed in an effort to amp up benefits for unemployed individuals.  Some local governments have made it illegal for power and utilities to be shut off due to a missed payment during the pandemic and others have urged landlords to halt rent payments temporarily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even some insurance agencies and gyms have paused memberships or reduced rates in an effort to accommodate out-of-work individuals. Given the current situation with so many struggling, many companies have created more lenient payment policies. If you are unable to pay certain monthly bills, you should begin contacting those companies or agencies immediately since they may be willing to assist you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 pandemic has created a great feeling of uncertainty about the future for most of us.  If you are struggling financially, you are certainly not alone. There are resources available to you now, such as stimulus checks and unemployment insurance, to help make this time a little easier. However, if you still have concerns about how to move forward financially during these trying times, please <a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\">contact us</a>.

If you live in a house where there are lots of arguments, you are more likely to struggle to form healthy relationships on your own.  As we consider that these types of characteristics are often learned as we grow up, does how we are raised also impact our finances?  A recent survey gives us a better understanding of how certain financial upbringings can shape our money attitudes as adults.</span></p>\n<h5><b>EARLY INFLUENCE</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to over three-quarters of those surveyed, parents influenced their financial habits as adults and those in good current financial standing were the most likely to have had some parental influence at an early age.  Those with bad financial standing also claimed that their parents influenced their financial habits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some reason, many parents shy away from money conversations with their children, even though it could have a positive influence on their financial habits. Over half of those surveyed said their parents never talked to them about the value of their financial accounts or life insurance or whether they had investments or debt. If these topics were discussed, it typically wasn’t until the children were adults themselves. Of the parents who did talk to their children about money, it was most commonly about their general financial standing and occurred around age 15.</span></p>\n<h5><b>FINANCIAL EMERGENCY DISCUSSIONS</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research suggests that talking to your children about the scarier side of money can be quite impactful. Respondents whose parents talked to them about the possibility of financial crises or recessions as children were more likely to be in good financial standing as adults. A key component of financial security is having cash resources you can tap in case of a financial emergency. This is why it’s important to talk to your children about financial crises or recessions, like the “dot-com bubble” that changed the way many baby boomers viewed investing, or the Great Recession that scarred millennials. Now, the COVID-19 global pandemic is likely to have a similar impact on Generation Z. Discussing these worst-case scenarios increases the likelihood that your children will plan ahead with an emergency fund as adults. </span></p>\n<h5><b>PRINCIPLES FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teaching your children financial life lessons could reduce the possibility of entering into credit card debt. According to our respondents, people whose parents taught them basic financial life lessons had less credit card debt than those whose parents didn’t teach them anything about money. The most common financial lesson parents taught their millennial children was the difference between a need and a want.  Despite having received the most financial education from their parents, millennials reported the highest instance of being worse off financially than their parents.  However, the majority of millennials thought they would eventually be better off than their parents. Their financial optimism may be due to the fact that nearly one-third of millennials received a pay raise in the past 12 months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The least commonly imparted financial lesson for all generations was how to invest, which is unfortunate given those whose parents did teach them how to invest typically reported having the highest income and estimated net worth. When it comes to gender, parents were especially negligent in discussing investing where their daughters were concerned; men were 35% more likely than women to have been taught to invest. Men were also more likely to have been taught about financial goal setting. One reason for the discrepancy could be that mothers are more likely to teach their daughters about finance, thus causing traditional gender roles to get passed down from generation to generation. However, when it comes to generational changes, many millennial women have made strides in income and now earn more than their mothers.</span></p>\n<h5><b>SPENDING STYLES</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The survey results suggested a connection between parents’ spending style and their children’s style. The more responsible a parent is with his or her spending, the more likely their children are to be responsible spenders themselves. Over half of respondents whose parents only spent money when they could afford it reported being debt-free today, compared to only 42% of respondents whose parents often spent beyond their means. Children whose parents were conservative spenders, often choosing to forgo luxuries even when they could afford it, were the most likely to have an emergency fund as an adult and children whose parents only spent when they could afford it were slightly less likely to have emergency funds as adults. Having a parent who often spent beyond their means can lead to more debt and less in emergency funds, but the majority of children brought up in such households said they’ve done better for themselves as adults. Children of responsible and conservative spenders were far more likely to emulate their parents’ spending habits as adults. </span></p>\n<h5><b>CREATING A BETTER FINANCIAL FUTURE</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How we raise our children has a formative impact on who they become as adults. If you teach them how to save and invest, they are more likely to become financially responsible adults. A financial education should be a key aspect of any child’s upbringing. It is important to facilitate healthy conversations about money with our children so they are prepared for the important financial life lessons as they grow up.  Teaching key financial tools to our children will enable them to budget, manage their finances and plan for their futures as adults.  If you have any questions relating to teaching your children about early financial habits, please <a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\">contact us</a> &#8211; we are here to help!</span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9230769230769231,"src":"/static/7417f4fc47587145fe7ba4ca18bf0613/da113/teaching-kids-about-money.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7417f4fc47587145fe7ba4ca18bf0613/3f132/teaching-kids-about-money.jpg 100w,\n/static/7417f4fc47587145fe7ba4ca18bf0613/8850c/teaching-kids-about-money.jpg 200w,\n/static/7417f4fc47587145fe7ba4ca18bf0613/da113/teaching-kids-about-money.jpg 400w,\n/static/7417f4fc47587145fe7ba4ca18bf0613/7223d/teaching-kids-about-money.jpg 600w,\n/static/7417f4fc47587145fe7ba4ca18bf0613/f2cbb/teaching-kids-about-money.jpg 800w,\n/static/7417f4fc47587145fe7ba4ca18bf0613/52a0e/teaching-kids-about-money.jpg 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"cf7fe9b3-9be1-588c-bdb5-5f4e0599340a","slug":"the-cares-act-has-waived-rmd-distributions-for-2020","title":"The CARES Act Has Waived RMD Distributions for 2020 &#8211; What You Should Know","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and was signed into law on March 27, 2020. COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the financial and physical health of Americans and businesses across the country. There are many features of this new law, but one specific change to required minimum distributions (RMDs) has presented an interesting opportunity for retirees. </span></p>\n<h5><b>The CARES Act &#8211; RMDs </b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Section 2203 titled, “Temporary Waiver of Required Minimum Distribution Rules for Certain Retirement Plans and Accounts,” those who are typically required to take minimum distributions from their retirement savings accounts will not be required to do so for the remainder of 2020.</span><em><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1</span></sup></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  This will affect anyone who would normally have to take an RMD in 2020, whether it’s coming from a company 401(k), 403(b) or an IRA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in December 2019, the SECURE Act was passed which changed the age at which an individual is required to begin taking minimum distributions. According to the IRS: “If you reached the age of 70½ in 2019 the prior rule applies, and you must take your first RMD by April 1, 2020. If you reach age 70 ½ in 2020 or later you must take your first RMD by April 1 of the year after you reach 72.”</span><em><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the CARES Act has put a pause on RMDs &#8211; even for those who turned 70 ½ in 2019. </span></p>\n<h5><b>The CARES Act &#8211; Inherited IRAs</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the language of the CARES Act does not mention Inherited IRAs specifically, it does say RMDs have been put on pause for all retirement accounts. Unless further clarification is presented, it is implied that those who have inherited an IRA are not required to take RMDs in 2020.</span></p>\n<h5><b>I’ve Already Withdrawn Money &#8211; Can I Return It?</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change to RMDs is valid for the entire year of 2020, starting January 1, but the CARES Act did not go into effect until the end of March. If you had already taken your RMD for the year, you can not return it. However, if you have taken an RMD within the last 60 days, you do have the option to roll this amount over into an IRA. This option can only be done once in a 12-month period, but it may be beneficial for those who took their RMD just before the law was passed. It should be noted that this 60-day rollover option is not available to those withdrawing from an inherited account.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Should I Skip My RMD In 2020?</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest advantage of skipping your RMDs for 2020 is a reduced tax bill. If you choose to take your RMD as usual, this money taken out would count as income, so you would have a higher tax bill next year. In a time where many are facing critical financial struggles, the government is looking to ease financial stress for retirees by allowing them to skip RMDs this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also important to note that RMDs are based on “the account balance as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year divided by a distribution period from the IRS’s ‘Uniform Lifetime Table,’” according to the IRS.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><sup>3</sup></em>  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, your RMD would be determined based, in part, on the account balance as of December 31, 2019 &#8211; a time in which markets were strong and nearing a peak. Since then, the market has experienced general economic volatility and waiting to take RMDs until 2021 will hopefully give retirees a chance to see their accounts regain some of those lost values. Taking the money out now means retirees would be left paying taxes on value that no longer exists in their accounts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the aspects of The CARES Act has presented retirees with a potentially advantageous opportunity. While those that need are still able to withdraw from their retirement accounts, those who typically have RMDs are not required to take them until 2021.

They may also use the loan to pay interest on mortgages and rent and utilities.<em><sup>2</sup></em> In order to be eligible for loan forgiveness, the business must maintain the same number of employees (equivalents) in the eight weeks following the date of origination of the loan as it did from either February 15, 2019 through June 30, 2019, or from January 1, 2020 through February 29, 2020.<em><sup>3 </sup></em></span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Small Business Administration</b></span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$62.1 billion will be granted to the Small Business Administration to assist small businesses who have been hit hard by the current pandemic.<em><sup>1 </sup></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This amount will be broken down by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.1 billion in salaries and expenses</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$50 billion for the “Disaster Loans Program Account” to cover the cost of direct loans authorized by the SBA</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10 billion for emergency EIDL grants<em><sup>1</sup></em>   </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newly passed Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act is designed to assist those who have been hit hard by this global pandemic &#8211; small businesses forced to cease or reduce operations and healthcare providers on the frontlines.

However, the rapid spread of the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coronavirus has led to a skyrocketing demand for wills, even for those who aren&#8217;t middle aged or older. What once appeared to be a scourge that was primarily affecting the elderly and those with underlying health issues has now been revealed to hospitalize and kill those who are younger, seemingly at an alarming rate.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The search term “getting a will” has risen sharply since March 8 and there have been tweets from doctors and nurses in recent days about wanting to get advanced health-care directives—living wills, power of attorney for health-care decisions and do-not-resuscitate orders—because they know their work might expose them to the virus.  Whether or not you are on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, it is a good idea to make sure you have the following information completed and updated for you and your family should the need arise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Wills &amp; Beneficiaries</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is a good time to check your existing beneficiary designations for each of your retirement accounts, annuities, and life insurance policies to make sure they are current and you do not have any lapses. In cases where family situations have changed, possibly because of divorce or birth of children or grandchildren, these designations aren’t often up to date. In the event you do not have a named beneficiary who survives you, your estate will be the beneficiary, which is rarely a good result. With a Will, you can generally leave any type of property to whomever you wish, with some exceptions. Wills can be contested in probate court, but beneficiary designations are legally binding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people haven’t had an opportunity to change or update their beneficiaries since the SECURE Act was implemented.  See (</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-secure-act-how-affect-retirement-4692743\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-secure-act-how-affect-retirement-4692743</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) to review how your retirement may be impacted by the SECURE Act).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Durable Power of Attorney</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A durable power of attorney is a written document where you designate another person (agent) to act on your behalf. In the event you become physically or mentally incapacitated, it enables your agent to handle your affairs. A person’s ability to name a power of attorney normally terminates upon their incapacity. With an immediate durable power of attorney, you grant your agent the authority effective immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Health Care Proxy</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also called a durable power of attorney for health care, this document appoints a representative to make medical decisions on your behalf. You decide what your representative will have control over  (i.e., selection of health care providers, approval of tests and procedures, etc.). It is important to have an active health care proxy in place in the event you become incapacitated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have adult children, you might want to make sure they also have health care proxies in place. In addition to having a health care proxy, a living will allows you to approve or decline certain types of medical care, such as life support, even if you will die as a result.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Trusts</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have previously established a living or irrevocable trust, now is a good time to confirm that your trustees and successor trustees are still alive, willing to serve, and that you still want them to serve should the need arise. You should also confirm that all the assets you want to pass through your trust are correctly titled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the above topics are often difficult to think about, this also might be a good time to take a look at your financial plan as well. Depending on your circumstances, it might be beneficial to gift highly appreciated assets out of your estate at deep discounts. If you are in a low tax bracket, converting part or all of your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to a Roth IRA could be an asset to your long-term retirement plans.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should you need any referrals for an estate lawyer, we are happy to put you in touch with someone.  If you have any financial questions, please <a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\">contact us</a> anytime.  We hope you are staying safe and healthy &#8211; we are all in this together!</span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9230769230769231,"src":"/static/1efcf96452de6d3ccaf1d97513d76589/da113/estate-planning-2.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1efcf96452de6d3ccaf1d97513d76589/3f132/estate-planning-2.jpg 100w,\n/static/1efcf96452de6d3ccaf1d97513d76589/8850c/estate-planning-2.jpg 200w,\n/static/1efcf96452de6d3ccaf1d97513d76589/da113/estate-planning-2.jpg 400w,\n/static/1efcf96452de6d3ccaf1d97513d76589/7223d/estate-planning-2.jpg 600w,\n/static/1efcf96452de6d3ccaf1d97513d76589/f2cbb/estate-planning-2.jpg 800w,\n/static/1efcf96452de6d3ccaf1d97513d76589/52a0e/estate-planning-2.jpg 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"9bf3b43c-b929-5388-91d7-5c7093d21204","slug":"managing-your-money-during-a-pandemic","title":"Managing Your Money During a Pandemic","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As many of us continue to stay home to do our part to flatten the curve and limit the spread of COVID-19, we are still adjusting to our new “normal”. Virtually every part of our lives has been affected by the pandemic, including the economy. While we cannot control the fact that many stores, restaurants and other businesses are temporarily closed and the market is volatile, we</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> control our personal finances.  Whether by adjusting spending or being more mindful, there are some simple ways we can manage our money and help us maintain some control over our finances during these uncertain times.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Remain Objective &amp; Focus on Your Personal Economy</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the market has been a bit of a roller coaster these past few months, it might be tempting to sell stocks or switch investments.  However, it is important to remember that investments are typically set up for long-term goals and not short-term gains.  If you are feeling very anxious about your current investments or portfolio, it’s important to talk to your financial advisor before making any drastic decisions. Instead of focusing on the overall market and other aspects of the economy we cannot control, it might be more beneficial to focus on your own personal budget and household finances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Review Your Emergency Savings Fund</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An emergency fund is money set aside to help in the face of unexpected circumstances, such as an accident, loss of income, or a home repair. These savings can assist in both small and large unplanned expenses that come up and are not part of your usual bills and spending.<em><sup>1</sup></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even when not dealing with a global pandemic, it’s a good idea to make sure you have adequate savings or an emergency fund if you don’t already have one. Since we are currently living through a situation that has the capacity to affect every individual’s health or job status, making sure you and your family have enough in case of an emergency is one way to stay proactive and prepared.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Be Aware of Scams</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, during a crisis such as this, we also see an increase in scams that capitalize on the fears of the vulnerable. It is important to be aware of the various scams that are prevalent during this pandemic. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Scam #1: Emails Offering Information About COVID-19 </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to keep your eye out for emails that claim to have information about the coronavirus pandemic &#8211; especially if they’re offering this information in exchange for personal information. This is an easy way for scammers to lure someone in, since most people are isolated at home and worried about the pandemic. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Scam #2: Suspicious Links</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you receive an email from a friend or business with a link or attachment that is unexpected or out of the norm, consider contacting the sender before opening the link. If the link is from a scammer, the link could download a virus or malware onto your computer or device. </span></p>\n<p><b>Key signs of a suspicious email may include:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor grammar and misspellings</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of specific information (your name, account info, etc.)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The messaging has a sense of urgency</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sender’s address is different than usual</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Scam #3: Phone Calls &amp; Texts</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you may be more inclined to answer all incoming texts or calls during these times, be cautious of what calls and texts you’re responding to. Do not respond to calls or texts from unknown numbers or those coming from suspicious country or area codes. If you do answer the phone and it’s a robocall, do not press any numbers or say anything into the receiver.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), scammers are using this opportunity to offer fake items over the phone including:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medicine to cure coronavirus</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work-from-home opportunities</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At-home test kits</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccinations<em><sup>2</sup></em>   </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to scams relating to the current pandemic, you should treat every “quick fix” opportunity as something that’s too good to be true. As of early April, the FDA has not approved at-home test kits, and a vaccine, cure or preventative drug has not been put on the market.<sup><em>2</em></sup> Scammers may also try to advertise that they’re selling in-demand items such as cleaning products, toilet paper or masks &#8211; be sure to take caution if it’s not from an authorized seller or place of business you’ve frequented prior to this time.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Scam #4: Stimulus Checks</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the recent passing of legislation in multiple countries, many people have become eligible to receive financial assistance in the form of checks or rebates and with . With some people eager for their money, they may be less likely to question potential texts, emails or phone calls about government assistance. Remember to use the same caution you would with any other email, phone call or text when it comes to receiving any type of communications regarding government money.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time of heightened fear, anxiety and vulnerability, it’s important to remain wary of any potential scams. Your personal and financial information are always at risk of getting into the wrong hands, so it is extremely important to educate and inform yourself in order to prevent falling victim to any of these dangerous scams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Review Your Budget</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you’re reassessing your current budget or starting fresh, begin by breaking down where your money goes when it comes to housing, food, transportation, health, personal/family, financial and miscellaneous.  Even if your job status has not changed and your income remains steady, you should still review your monthly budget, cutting unnecessary costs and taking advantage of any extra money. The lack of restaurants, bars and stores to visit may mean you now have greater disposable income. If you find yourself with any extra money, you might consider increasing your retirement fund or 529 plan contributions or adding to your emergency savings. You might also decide to donate to those in need, such as food banks or groups supporting hospitals and health facilities, which could all use extra funds during the crisis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Stay Informed Regarding Available Resources</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to COVID-19 in the United State, the CARES Act was passed to help families and businesses affected by the pandemic. This bill includes extended unemployment benefits, healthcare aid and one-time stimulus checks for individuals with adjusted gross incomes up to $75,000 (single), $150,000 (joint), or $112,500 (heads of household).<em><sup>3</sup></em> The tax filing deadline has been extended to July 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we continue to confront this global emergency, there are many things we can do to stay both physically healthy and financially prepared.

Now that a stimulus deal has been reached, anxiety centered on bill payments has dipped among all generations. However, Generation X was the only group of Americans whose concern to pay bills increased significantly since the outbreak began.  For those in lower income brackets that had been concerned about their ability to pay bills before the pandemic, those concerns actually lessened after the passage of the stimulus bill since they will now be receiving extra money to help pay those bills.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>The value of investments</b></span></h4>\n<h5><b>Current level: 5.97/10 (Before the crisis: 4.84)</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average level of concern about the value of investments like CDs, stock and retirement accounts has increased from before the start of the outbreak. Baby boomers have the highest concern about the value of their investments since they are the ones either close to retirement or already in retirement and relying on their investments to live. About 1 in 5 (20 percent) of the highest earners are also extremely concerned about what their investments are worth. The positive is that fe</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w investors with stock-related holdings have made adjustments in response to their fears</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In order to avoid hurting your long-term goal to attain wealth, please make sure you check with your financial advisor before making any changes to your portfolio.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Job and income stability</b></span></h4>\n<h5><b>Current level: 5.88/10 (Before the crisis: 5.35)</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concerns about </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">job and income stability</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have increased slightly since before the outbreak started. Prior to the pandemic, the least-educated adults were most likely to express being extremely concerned about their job and income situation. However, now a higher amount of post-graduates (mainly millennials and Gen Xers) feel extremely concerned about their job security and income stability compared to the least-educated survey respondents. Members of Generation Z, who were actually most worried about their income and job situation before the coronavirus spread, are now among the least likely to express extreme concern.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Personal health</b></span></h4>\n<h5><b>Current level: 6.51/10 (Before the crisis: 5.93)</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For obvious reasons, Americans’ personal health has become a greater concern since the coronavirus outbreak.  However, there are fewer worried about their well-being now that the huge government stimulus package has been approved. Overall, concerns about personal well-being are consistently a bit higher for women than men. </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>The health of loved ones</b></span></h4>\n<h5><b>Current level: 7.59/10 (Before the crisis: 6.61)</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the board, concerns about the health of loved ones trumps concerns about personal health and finances. There seems to be a higher concern for loved ones’ health among minorities, though that gap has narrowed some.  In addition, concern for the health of loved ones is slightly greater for low income families.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Control what you can about your finances</b></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the current crisis, those with major concerns about health and finance may feel as though little is in their control. But there are still plenty of ways to be proactive about managing money. Try to start by setting a budget and tracking how much money is coming in and what’s going out.  This is especially important if your financial situation has recently changed to some extent. You should be looking for ways to increase your emergency fund, trim expenses and pay off some debt if you are able to. Since most of us aren’t spending money on movies, events and dining out, it might be a good idea to put some of that “discretionary spending” into savings instead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also extremely important to protect yourself against other potential issues. Make sure you are properly insured (life, health and disability) and comparison shop if you’re spending more than you can afford on premiums. And if you </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">haven’t added beneficiaries</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your accounts, now is a good time to consider doing so.  You should also make sure your will and other estate documents have been updated should the need arise.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At any point, if you are looking for guidance or advice on how to better your financial situation, please <a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\">contact us</a>.  We are here to help and we are all in this together!</span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9230769230769231,"src":"/static/5acfe5300cd5c7286f767890f7ca2ead/9f2d5/bills-image.png","srcSet":"/static/5acfe5300cd5c7286f767890f7ca2ead/91db1/bills-image.png 100w,\n/static/5acfe5300cd5c7286f767890f7ca2ead/dc47e/bills-image.png 200w,\n/static/5acfe5300cd5c7286f767890f7ca2ead/9f2d5/bills-image.png 400w,\n/static/5acfe5300cd5c7286f767890f7ca2ead/fa42c/bills-image.png 600w,\n/static/5acfe5300cd5c7286f767890f7ca2ead/90823/bills-image.png 800w,\n/static/5acfe5300cd5c7286f767890f7ca2ead/87116/bills-image.png 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"fca85e47-27bd-5278-9f55-4ae9cc750503","slug":"how-to-manage-your-mental-health-during-a-quarantine","title":"How To Manage Your Mental Health During A Quarantine","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living through a pandemic has created some very trying times for all of us &#8211; not just financially, but also physically, mentally and emotionally. Even if you aren&#8217;t a healthcare professional or other essential worker on the front lines, it’s still difficult to cope with the dramatic change in lifestyle and stress we’re all experiencing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remaining in quarantine for an extended amount of time is difficult. We all react differently to stressful situations, but there are things we can all do to remain mentally strong. Here are some helpful tips to better manage your mental health while social distancing at home.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Tip #1: Take Breaks from the News and Social Media</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it’s important to take breaks from social media and the news.</span><em><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1</span></sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even for those who want to stay informed, taking in too much information these days can be upsetting and stressful. Whether you are on social media, listening to the radio or watching the news, it’s hard to break your attention away from the current global crisis. It’s important to find a balance that allows you to stay informed without overwhelming yourself. Even if you typically check your social media accounts each morning, you may find yourself not wanting to be inundated with so much Covid-19 information first thing and might want to change up your daily routine a bit for the foreseeable future..</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Tip #2: Remember to Exercise</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As important as it is to stay on top of our physical health during this time, exercise can be just as important for our mental health. Whether it’s yoga, jogging or walking, riding your bike or hiking, participating in these physical activities allows you to take time for yourself and away from others and the news. Now that the weather is getting warmer, you may even be able to take your physical activity outdoors &#8211; just remember the social distancing rules while engaging in outdoor activities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Tip #3: Practice Meditation</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you’ve never done it before, mediation is great way to practice self-care. Regular meditation can help anyone become more mindful and at ease. It can give you a sense of calm and physical relaxation, as well as improve your psychological balance and enhance your overall health and mental stability.</span><em><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></sup></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Tip #4: Make Sure You Are Connecting with Others</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though we’re unable to physically be present with friends and family at the current time, it&#8217;s still possible to keep in touch with others virtually. You can set up a Skype, Zoom or Facetime meeting with your friends or catch up over the phone. You can also send good old-fashioned snail mail notes or cards to others. There are many ways you can connect and brighten someone’s day, because chances are your loved ones are feeling anxious as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Tip #5: Try a New Hobby</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With more time on your hands than ever, now is a great time to try something new. Whether it’s painting, knitting, photography or whatever else you’ve always had an interest in trying, it’s a great way to do something fun while clearing your head. If you are at home with children, you could also do age-appropriate crafts and activities as a whole family.  It’s also a perfect time to start a weekly family game night or start some 1000 piece family puzzles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Tip #6: Help Others</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many ways to stay compliant with social distancing regulations and help others at the same time. Some ideas include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offer to get groceries for at-risk neighbors and family members</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donate to local food banks </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide meals to local hospital workers</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a monetary donation online</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping others in this time of crisis not only helps the community around you, it also makes you feel good as well!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Tip #7: Get Plenty of Sleep</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep is a time to recharge your batteries, unwind from the day and prepare for tomorrow. Even if anxiety is keeping you up a night, getting the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep will help you to work better, feel better and stay healthy.</span><em><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 </span></sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Tip #8: Eat a Balanced and Healthy Diet</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though we are stuck inside more than usual, it isn’t an excuse to forego healthy eating habits. While it’s perfectly fine to enjoy some treats in moderation, make sure that you are still eating meals packed with protein, fruits and vegetables. Eating a healthy, balanced diet will help everyone in your household feel better both mentally and physically over the coming weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope that everyone stays healthy and safe while we are all doing our part to “flatten the curve” and ride out this pandemic. As we all endure the emotional and mental stress of the coming weeks, it’s comforting to know there are things we can do to support ourselves, our families and our communities during this time.  As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to <a href=\"info@shermanwealth.com\">email us</a> or set up a time to<a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\"> talk</a>.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fmanaging-stress-anxiety.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fmanaging-stress-anxiety.html</span></a></em></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-in-depth\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-in-depth</span></a></em></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/articles/sleep/sleep-needs-get-the-sleep-you-need.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.helpguide.org/articles/sleep/sleep-needs-get-the-sleep-you-need.htm</span></a></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"8cefe7f7-6e41-545f-8edd-d595a162870a","slug":"what-to-do-if-you-cant-pay-for-college-next-year","title":"What To Do If You Can&#8217;t Pay For College Next Year","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many families, the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically changed their financial circumstances. For those with children going to college in the fall, it has created even more of a financial burden and has left many wondering how they are going to pay for it.  Even those that will receive financial aid from the school may still owe more than they can now afford.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 69% of parents and 55% of students entering college in the fall said the coronavirus has impacted their ability to pay for school.  With many non-essential businesses forced to close, not only are parents across the country suddenly facing extended furloughs or lay-offs, but many students have also lost the ability to work to help pay for school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself in this situation and are unsure of how you will come up with the money to pay for college this coming fall, there are a few things you can do to potentially help with the financial burden.</span></p>\n<p><b>TRY TO GET MORE FINANCIAL AID</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone in financial need should be reaching out to their college or university as soon as possible &#8211; time is of the essence.  Since most students filed the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid form) in the fall, their circumstances were likely much different back then.  Now families can amend their FAFSA form or ask the college financial aid office for a “professional judgement review.” If there are need-based issues beyond what was noted in the financial aid paperwork, such as increased health-related expenses or the loss of a job, those should be explained to the school and documented, if possible.  Death, illness and income loss are always grounds for revisit the FAFSA. The best way to make a request is to write an appeal letter to the school’s financial aid office.  </span></p>\n<p><b>APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 8 in 10 families tap scholarships and grants to help cover costs since money that does not have to be paid back is considered the most desirable kind of assistance — and some of this funding is still available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though it is somewhat late in the game, try to go after private scholarships and grants.  Students should look for local scholarships, particularly from organizations in their community, where the odds of getting an award are better than national competitions.

Two car insurers in the U.S., Allstate and American Family Mutual, have decided to pass those savings along to their customers.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allstate, the country’s fourth biggest car insurer, said it would give back $600 million in total to customers and American Family Mutual is planning to refund $200 million.  Both insurers have seen a huge drop in accidents as more and more people stay at home and off the roads. Compared with last year, claims were down 20% to 40% weekly from March 11 through April 3. In addition, the insurers estimate that policyholders drove 40% fewer miles in the last three weeks of March.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With millions of households financially strapped during the lockdown, the refunds come at a good time for many.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allstate will pay customers back in two ways &#8211; drivers in quarantine will receive refunds while most customers will be given a 15% discount on monthly premiums for April &amp; May.  American Family is returning $50 per insured vehicle.

Since the auto-insurance industry is a rare bright spot while many other industries flounder right now, it’s nice to see them passing some of their savings along to their customers.  For those stuck at home and struggling financially, these refunds are sure to help. However, if you have essential work that keeps you on the road, stay safe out there!</span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9230769230769231,"src":"/static/478ec62be0b7f747880b3ac08934eac1/da113/no-traffic.jpg","srcSet":"/static/478ec62be0b7f747880b3ac08934eac1/3f132/no-traffic.jpg 100w,\n/static/478ec62be0b7f747880b3ac08934eac1/8850c/no-traffic.jpg 200w,\n/static/478ec62be0b7f747880b3ac08934eac1/da113/no-traffic.jpg 400w,\n/static/478ec62be0b7f747880b3ac08934eac1/7223d/no-traffic.jpg 600w,\n/static/478ec62be0b7f747880b3ac08934eac1/f2cbb/no-traffic.jpg 800w,\n/static/478ec62be0b7f747880b3ac08934eac1/52a0e/no-traffic.jpg 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"597df486-ab79-57be-b655-60058b8a7019","slug":"the-paycheck-protection-program-for-small-business-owners","title":"The Paycheck Protection Program &#8211; For Small Business Owners","content":"<div>Self-employed individuals and small businesses account for a large portion of our country’s economy and are often the ones suffering the hardest hits during a pandemic. On March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law, allocating funding to support the U.S. economy and workers through the coronavirus outbreak.</div>\n<p>The legislation includes a number of proposals aimed at supporting small businesses.<em><sup>1</sup></em> For those hit hard due to forced closures and a sharp downturn in foot traffic, this bill may provide some relief.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What Does the Package Include?</strong></span></p>\n<p>American small businesses are supported by the recently passed CARES Act in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A $350 billion forgivable loan program (The Paycheck Protection Program) designed to encourage small businesses from laying off employees.</li>\n<li>A delay in employer-side payroll taxes for Social Security until 2021 and 2022.</li>\n<li>50 percent refundable payroll tax credit on worker wages to incentivize businesses, including those with fewer than 500 employees, to retain their current workforce.</li>\n<li>Sole proprietors and other self-employed workers may be eligible for the expanded unemployment insurance benefits the bill provides.</li>\n<li>A portion of the $425 billion in funds appropriated for the Federal Reserve’s credit facilities will target small businesses.<em><sup>2</sup></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How Does the $350 Billion Paycheck Protection Program Work?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Under the stimulus package, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will oversee the Paycheck Protection Program. This program will distribute $350 billion to small businesses that meet certain requirements, and the loans will be made available to companies with 500 or fewer employees.<em><sup>3 </sup></em></p>\n<p>Businesses can receive loans up to $10 million, and these loans will be administered by banks and other lenders. Additionally, the Paycheck Protection loans will carry a maximum interest rate of up to just four percent.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p>Currently, the SBA guarantees small business loans that are distributed by a network of more than 800 lenders across the country. The program creates a form of emergency loan that has the potential to be forgiven when used to maintain payroll through June of 2020. In order for the above amounts to be forgiven, the business must maintain the same number of employees (equivalents) in the eight weeks following the date of origination of the loan as it did from either February 15, 2019 through June 30, 2019, or from January 1, 2020 through February 29, 2020.<sup><em>1</em></sup> The program also expands the network beyond the SBA so that more banks, credit unions and lenders can issue the appropriate loans.</p>\n<p>If your business uses the loan funds for the approved purposes and maintains the average size of your full-time workforce based on when you received the loan, the principal loan will be forgiven, meaning you will only need to pay back the interest accrued.<em><sup>2</sup></em> The primary purpose of these loans is to incentivize small businesses to refrain from laying off workers and ultimately rehire laid-off employees that have already lost jobs due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What Types of Businesses Are Eligible For The Paycheck Protection Program?</strong></span></p>\n<p>The Paycheck Protection Program offers loans for small businesses with fewer than 500 employees, 501(c)(3) nonprofits with fewer than 500 workers and some 501(c)(19) veteran organizations. Food service businesses are also eligible if they employ fewer than 500 people per physical location.<em><sup>1 </sup></em></p>\n<p>Self-employed individuals, sole proprietors and freelance or gig economy workers are also eligible to apply for financial assistance during this time. Even without a personal guarantee or collateral, businesses that are struggling can receive a loan as long as they were operational on February 15, 2020.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>Eligible borrowers are required to make a good-faith certification that the loan is necessary due to the uncertainty of current economic conditions caused by COVID-19.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How Do I Get a Payroll Protection Loan?</strong></span></p>\n<p>The loan program will provide loans through SBA-approved private lenders. As banks are currently working on implementing this program, it’s important to check with your local bank to see where they’re at in the process. Those that are already approved by the Small Business Association may be quicker to put the loan program into place.</p>\n<p>As a small business owner or self-employed individual, it’s always important to be aware of your options during challenging times. By using some of the new programs recently enacted, and the promise of keeping your workers employed, your small business can continue to thrive.</p>\n<p>As always, if you have any questions related to The Paycheck Protection Program or if you have other concerns, please<a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\"> reach out</a> &#8211; we are here for you!</p>\n<ol>\n<li><cite><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585932807220000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1aamI_eoWMKckj9H314eMQ6euRw\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/<wbr />116th-congress/house-bill/748/<wbr />text</a></cite></li>\n<li><cite><a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CARES%20Section-by-Section%20FINAL.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CARES%2520Section-by-Section%2520FINAL.PDF&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585932807220000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTcCNX30vBhi-ibN7wRMrArWnfNQ\">https://www.help.senate.gov/<wbr />imo/media/doc/CARES%20Section-<wbr />by-Section%20FINAL.PDF</a></cite></li>\n<li><cite><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585932807220000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFefHuehcbYvEMHiTQCJrJOkyZwpg\">https://www.npr.org/2020/03/<wbr />26/821457551/whats-inside-the-<wbr />senate-s-2-trillion-<wbr />coronavirus-aid-package</a></cite></li>\n</ol>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9230769230769231,"src":"/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/da113/ppp.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/3f132/ppp.jpg 100w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/8850c/ppp.jpg 200w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/da113/ppp.jpg 400w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/7223d/ppp.jpg 600w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/f2cbb/ppp.jpg 800w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/52a0e/ppp.jpg 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c95a8d93-a0ac-5e3e-a04a-622215e582c2","slug":"the-new-401k-no-penalty-withdrawals-in-the-cares-act","title":"The New 401(k) No-Penalty Withdrawals in the CARES Act","content":"<p>As part of the CARES Act, some of the rules about taking money out of your 401(k) are being temporarily lifted to help people affected by the coronavirus pandemic. While the added flexibility may help some ride out the crisis, there is some concern that some might be tempted to take out huge sums now—and, as a result, either put their eventual retirements in jeopardy or possibly leave themselves with a big tax bill.</p>\n<p>Here is some important information regarding what has changed and how to approach your 401(k) as it relates to these changes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What is a coronavirus-related 401(k) distribution? Is it really a no-penalty withdrawal?</strong></span></p>\n<p>One provision of the CARES Act relaxes the rules for taking money from your 401(k). Investors of any age can take out a &#8220;coronavirus-related distribution&#8221; of as much as $100,000 (or up to 100% of the balance) without paying early withdrawal penalties. The act also increases the maximum &#8220;loan&#8221; from your 401k to this amount (previously that was limited to $50,000 or 50% of an employee&#8217;s balance).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Who is eligible for a 401(k) coronavirus-related distribution?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Your company&#8217;s 401(k) plan sponsor will determine whether coronavirus-related distributions will be permitted, whether you meet the criteria for this type of distribution, and whether the amount you request fits the hardship you are facing.  Anyone who has contracted the virus, has had a spouse or a dependent contract the virus, or has experienced financial hardship because of it, would be considered eligible.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Is a coronavirus-related 401(k) distribution a loan?</strong></span></p>\n<p data-inc=\"1\">No. Unlike a 401(k) loan that must be repaid, a coronavirus-related distribution does not need to be repaid. Employees can repay the distribution within three years without regard to annual contribution limits for their 401(k) plans, and that the repayment does not need to be made all at once. Any repayment of the distribution would be treated as a &#8220;rollover contribution&#8221; to the plan. But, any employee who takes a coronavirus-related distribution and does not pay it back will owe tax on the amount, through they will be able to pay the taxes owed over a three-year period.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Is it a good idea to take this new 401(k) distribution?</strong></span></p>\n<p>You should only take distribution from your 401(k) now if it&#8217;s your only option. The point of a 401(k) is that you are investing the money over a long-term period, so that the power of compound interest works in your favor throughout your career. So, since you&#8217;ll likely have to liquidate stocks to take money out now, this means selling when the market is down significantly.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Should I take my regular 401(k) distribution this year?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Another major provision under the CARES Act, is that required minimum distributions (RMDs) have been waived this year. If you can afford it, you should take advantage of not taking the distribution this year.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What if I take a 401(k) coronavirus-related distribution and then get laid off or furloughed?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Typically, if you take a loan from your 401(k) and then leave your company, you usually have to pay the money back immediately, or else it is considered a taxable distribution. But under the CARES Act, if an employee takes a coronavirus-related distribution and then leaves the company, the employee would not have to pay the distribution back.</p>\n<p>If you are laid off, furloughed, or your hours are cut, you can only contribute to your 410(k) if you are still getting a paycheck. Also, if employees are being paid emergency sick leave or expanded family and medical leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), those payments <em>are</em> eligible for salary reduction contributions to a 401(k) plan.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How is a 401(k) coronavirus-related distribution different from a hardship distribution?</strong></span></p>\n<p data-inc=\"2\">Most plans allow for &#8220;hardship distributions&#8221; in, say, the case of a major medical event. But these differ from the current coronavirus-related distributions since they are taxed in the year taken, cannot be repaid to the plan, and are limited to the amount necessary to meet the financial need.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Should I keep contributing to my 401(k)?</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you can keep up contributions—or even increase them—during this time, you should.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What are the 401(k) contribution limits for 2020?</strong></span></p>\n<p>At the end of last year, <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19500-for-2020-catch-up-limit-rises-to-6500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the IRS announced</a> that for 2020, the maximum contribution for individuals in 2020 would be raised to $19,500.

According to the <a class=\"gtrackexternal\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html\">New York Times:</a></p>\n<p><em>You qualify if you tested positive, a spouse or dependent did or you experienced a variety of other negative economic consequences related to the pandemic.

In order to take this loan, you’ll need to prove that your life has been affected by the Coronavirus. In addition, if you already have a current balance and were obligated to pay it back by 12/31 you’ll get an additional year, but you can’t borrow from your IRA.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-14238 size-full\" src=\"https://tonyisola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/download.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" srcset=\"https://tonyisola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/download.png 840w, https://tonyisola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/download-158x300.png 158w, https://tonyisola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/download-538x1024.png 538w, https://tonyisola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/download-768x1463.png 768w, https://tonyisola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/download-806x1536.png 806w\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"1600\" data-large_image_width=\"840\" data-large_image_height=\"1600\" /></p>\n<p><em>Source: <a class=\"gtrackexternal\" href=\"https://www.financial-planning.com/news/new-cares-act-would-bring-tax-relief-for-retirement-accounts\">Financial Planning</a></em></p>\n<p>The stimulus package created many new possibilities for leveraging retirement accounts &#8211; especially for families desperate for funds to keep a small business alive or cover loss of employment.  For those that might be ok financially, this package offers additional tax planning strategies.  If you have any questions relating to your retirement funds or other financial questions during these challenging times, please give us a <a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\">call</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9230769230769231,"src":"/static/03bdff2f8d8f8cd77dc8a817fa3f1f0e/da113/retirement-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/03bdff2f8d8f8cd77dc8a817fa3f1f0e/3f132/retirement-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/03bdff2f8d8f8cd77dc8a817fa3f1f0e/8850c/retirement-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/03bdff2f8d8f8cd77dc8a817fa3f1f0e/da113/retirement-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/03bdff2f8d8f8cd77dc8a817fa3f1f0e/7223d/retirement-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/03bdff2f8d8f8cd77dc8a817fa3f1f0e/f2cbb/retirement-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/03bdff2f8d8f8cd77dc8a817fa3f1f0e/52a0e/retirement-1.jpg 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"d3e4caa0-b72f-5fdb-98ab-1c2bb868539a","slug":"information-on-your-student-loans-during-the-covid-19-crisis","title":"Information on Your Student Loans During the COVID-19 Crisis","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent stimulus package recently passed by  Congress gives most federal student loan borrowers a six-month break from payments. It comes after a series of announcements by the U.S. Department of Education meant to alleviate student loan stress. The new law takes that relief even further.  The biggest break is that you can stop making payments on most federal student loans for six months — from April through September — and no new interest will accrue. That means, at the end of those six months, you’ll owe exactly what you did at the start.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congress didn’t wipe out any of your student debt, but it gave everyone a six-month payment holiday, regardless of how much they have or haven’t been hurt by the current wave of layoffs and closings designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus.  In addition, the stimulus package expands on and supersedes earlier relief programs Specifically, here’s how the new stimulus affects your student loans, and what to do if you’re in each of the situations below.</span></p>\n<p><strong>1. If You’re Current But Likely To Fall Behin</strong><strong>d</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you are able to pay your bill currently, but you’re concerned about losing income or affording payments in the next few months, you should take advantage of automatic student loan forbearance starting now.  Use it to build an emergency fund so that you can put it toward other essentials like food and housing in the future if necessary.</span></p>\n<p><b>2. If You’re Working Toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stimulus bill updates certain details regarding Public Service Loan Forgiveness. If you don’t make payments until Sept. 30, those months will still count toward your Public Service Loan Forgiveness timeline. That means you won’t have to make payments for extra months, past the time you planned to get forgiveness so even if you can keep paying loans, it doesn’t make sense to do so. If and when you do qualify for PSLF, you’ll receive forgiveness on the outstanding balance without needing to pay income tax on the amount forgiven.</span></p>\n<p><b>3. If You’re Current On Student Loan Payments And Your Income Is Secure</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t have to make payments right now, but since new interest won’t accrue, any payments you do make will be turbocharged. More of your payment will go toward your principal balance, helping you pay off the loan faster. If you’re not concerned about your income or shoring up savings at the moment, your best bet is to continue making payments while you can.</span></p>\n<p><b>4. If You’re Behind On Student Loan Payments</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borrowers who were more than 31 days behind on their loans receive automatic forbearance and now your payments are automatically postponed until Sept. 30. You don’t need to ask for forbearance from your student loan servicer, but it’s a smart idea to check your online account soon to make sure they’ve updated their records. Interest won’t accrue during this period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. Department of Education has also announced that:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collections activities will be paused, meaning you shouldn’t receive calls or letters about a federal loan in default that a private company is now collecting on.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The government will not withhold your pay, your tax refund or your Social Security payment — known as Treasury offsets — for at least 60 days if you’re in default, starting from March 13. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re in a rehabilitation program to get out of default, which requires you to make nine on-time student loan payments in 10 months, the clock doesn’t stop on your payment arrangement. Even if you don’t make payments for the next six months, those months will still be counted toward your rehabilitation timeline.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re worried you’ll need help after the pause on payments has ended, you can sign up for an income-driven repayment plan to limit your monthly bill to a percentage of your income for as long as you need to. You’ll also get forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of payments, and you’ll pay income tax on the forgiven balance. </span></p>\n<p><b>5. If You’re A Parent With Student Loans On Behalf Of A Child</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you took out federal direct PLUS loans to help your child pay for college, these are included as part of the stimulus package’s relief offerings. That means your payments will be suspended automatically until Sept. 30. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can continue to make payments, you’ll benefit from the fact that new interest isn’t being charged during this six month period. That means all payments you make during this period go directly toward your principal balance, potentially helping you pay off your loan quicker. </span></p>\n<h2><b>6. If You Have Commercially-Held FFEL Or School-Held Perkins Loans</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only loans held by the U.S. Department of Education qualify for relief in the stimulus package, including the interest waiver and payment suspension. Loans from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program that are owned by private entities, and Perkins loans owned by colleges, don’t qualify. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you can consolidate these loans into a direct consolidation loan in order to access stimulus benefits. Consolidating also lets you take advantage of income-driven repayment if you need it in the future. But if you have Perkins loans, that means giving up access to certain forgiveness programs for public service workers and other benefits. Weigh the pros and cons before consolidating.</span></p>\n<p><b>7. If You Have Private Student Loans</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal relief programs DO NOT apply to borrowers with private student loans. That means it’s up to you to call your lender and ask about loan modification programs, which many offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re at risk of falling behind on loan payments, request help from your lender as soon as possible. You can ask about options for reducing or pausing payments and waiving late fees. </span></p>\n<p><b>8. If You Don’t Know Where To Start</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is most important to know what type of student loans you have so you know whether you can confidently stop making payments or not. Most student loans are federally held, so if you’re unsure, start by signing in to StudentAid.gov with your Federal Student Aid ID, or </span><a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/account-info\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create an account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you know you have student loans but they’re not listed there, the loans may be private. All your loans will be listed on your credit report, so if not listed on StudentAid.gov, they are likely private. You can check your credit report for free once a year from each of the three main credit bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com.</span></p>\n<p>As always, if you have any questions relating to your student loans or any other aspects of your current financial situation, feel free to <a href=\"http://www.meetme.so/BradSherman\">set up a

Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act</a>. Spreading $2 trillion amongst businesses, hospitals, families and individuals, this economic stimulus package is designed to bring relief to those experiencing the ever-increasing threat of economic turmoil and downturn amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>After six days of back and forth between Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House, all parties came to an agreement on this historical $2 trillion package. For perspective, this relief package greatly surpasses the $168 billion offered to Americans in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which was the last time an economic stimulus package was passed.<em><sup>1</sup> </em></p>\n<p>If you’re wondering how this newly passed act may affect you, your place of employment or your local healthcare facility, we’ve gathered up the important numbers to know in this overview.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Unemployment Benefits</strong></span></p>\n<p>In an effort to extend unemployment benefits, eligible Americans on unemployment will receive an additional $600 per week for four months.<em><sup>2</sup></em> This is done in an effort to help those who are currently out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic better achieve their full pay over the next four months.</p>\n<p>This bill will allow unemployed individuals affected by the pandemic to receive unemployment insurance for an extended 13 weeks. In addition, it will allow out-of-work individuals to receive the enhanced unemployment benefits as outlined in this bill for four months.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>The bill has called for the creation of a pandemic unemployment assistant program that would offer unemployment benefits to those who have previously not been eligible &#8211; including those who have been furloughed by their employer, freelancers and gig workers (such as Uber or Lyft drivers).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Healthcare Aid</strong></span></p>\n<p>In the final iteration of the bill, hospitals will receive around $117 billion in aid.<em><sup>2</sup></em> In regards to helping healthcare workers on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bill is meant to help workers gain better access to protective equipment, testing supplies and provide construction or facilities to house the growing number of patients in need.</p>\n<p>Additionally, hospitals and healthcare providers will see a 20 percent increase in Medicare payments for treating those on Medicare with coronavirus.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Stimulus Checks</strong></span></p>\n<p>Some American taxpayers will be receiving direct stimulus payments of $1,200 as part of the new bill. Those with incomes up to $75,000 will receive the full $1,200, with the amount lowering and eventually phasing out for those who earn more than $99,000. Individuals earning $99,000 or couples earning $198,000 or more will not receive checks. Families who qualify with children can expect to receive an additional $500 in direct payments per child.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>To determine how much you will receive, the government will be basing your income level on your 2018 tax return, unless you have already filed your 2019 tax return.<em><sup>2</sup></em> As a reminder, the tax filing deadline has been extended to July 15, 2020.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Small Business Grants &amp; Loans</strong></span></p>\n<p>A large portion of this stimulus bill will be going toward assisting small businesses who have been affected greatly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, $500 billion will go toward assisting businesses and corporations, with $29 billion going to the aviation industry and $17 billion to businesses that work in national security. The remaining $454 billion can be leveraged as loans for other businesses or municipalities. Companies that choose to take this government assistance must agree to stop any stock buybacks for the length of the loan plus a year. In addition, these companies must retain at least 90 percent of their employee levels between March 24 and September 30, 2020.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>This money will be overseen by an inspector general and a five-person panel, who Congress will appoint. In addition, any businesses run or partially run (at least 20 percent stake in the company) by the Trump family, or other senior government officials, will not be eligible to use these funds.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Education</strong></span></p>\n<p>Millions of educators and students from K-12 through college have been affected by government orders to self-isolate. In an effort to assist school systems and institutions across the country, the government is granting $30 billion in emergency education funding.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>In addition, The Department of Education will be suspending payments so that borrowers would be allowed to put off paying their federal student loan payments without penalty until September 30th.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Airlines</strong></span></p>\n<p>Airlines have been hit hard during the pandemic and requested government assistance to help negate the crippling effects they’ve endured as a result. The relief bill will provide $32 billion in the form of grants to cover the wages and benefits of aviation employees.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how the $32 billion will be broken down within the aviation industry:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$25 billion for passenger airlines</li>\n<li>$4 billion for cargo airlines</li>\n<li>$3 billion for contractors (workers who handle ticketing, cleaning, catering, baggage, etc.)<em><sup>2</sup></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Passenger airlines and cargo airlines will also receive additional help, $25 billion and $4 billion respectively, via loans or loan guarantees.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>In exchange for this assistance, the government has banned airlines receiving assistance from furloughing employees, making pay cuts, buying back stocks or issuing dividends to investors through September.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Local Government</strong></span></p>\n<p>State and local governments haven’t been immune to the financial hardships this global pandemic has caused. The stimulus package is offering $150 billion for state and local governments that have been working to combat the effects of COVID-19 in their communities.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Food Assistance Programs</strong></span></p>\n<p>Anticipating a rise in demand for food banks as a result of the increasing unemployment rate, the bill has provided the Emergency Food Assistance Program with $450 million. Approximately $350 million would go toward purchasing food, with the remaining $100 million spent on the distribution of food to those in need. In addition, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories will receive $200 million for food assistance, and American Indian reservations will receive $100 million for food distribution.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p>While the news seems to be changing every day surrounding COVID-19 in America, this stimulus act is coming at a time when families and business owners alike are fearful of their financial future.

This is especially recommended if one feels sick or has a suspected or confirmed case of the virus. As directed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it’s important to self-quarantine and be mindful of personal hygiene, such as washing your hands and the like. Our health and the health of the nation is top of mind, but the question remains: will U.S. workers still get paid if they stay home?</p>\n<p>Roughly 25 percent of U.S. workers currently receive little to no paid sick leave, many of which are low-wage employees who depend on their paychecks.<sup><em>1</em> </sup>On March 18, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which intends to give paid leave to workers who did not have it and extend paid leave for workers who only received a few days. These benefits are only temporary, but they allow certain employees to receive paid leave if they need to take time off from work, due to the present virus.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding the Families First Coronavirus Response Act</strong><br />\nThe recently passed bill allows qualified employees two weeks of paid sick leave if they are sick, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventative care for COVID-19, or if they are caring for ill family members. Those who are caring for children whose schools are closed or whose childcare provider is unavailable due to the pandemic will be granted 12 weeks of paid leave.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p>As long as you’ve been employed for at least 30 days, most employees of small and midsize companies, as well as nonprofit and government employees can receive paid leave. If you are a part-time worker, you will be paid the amount you earn in a two-week period.<sup><em>2</em> </sup>Alternatively, if you’re self-employed and pay taxes, you can also receive paid leave.</p>\n<p><strong>Who Is Excluded?</strong><br />\nEmployees working at companies with more than 500 people are excluded from these benefits. Those employed at companies with less than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department is able to exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business.<sup><em>3</em></sup> Employers can also decline to give leave to those facing the crisis head-on, including emergency responders and healthcare providers.</p>\n<p><strong>How Will My Business Be Affected?</strong><br />\nCompanies with more than 500 employees will need to pay the cost of paid sick and emergency leave, but they will be eligible for reimbursement tax credits at a later time.</p>\n<p>Businesses will be reimbursed up to $511 per employee, per day for paid sick leave wages paid to employees who must quarantine because they are sick with COVID-19 or are trying to receive a diagnosis. For those employees caring for family members, employers will be reimbursed up to $200 per worker, per day.<em><sup>3</sup></em> Self-employed individuals are also eligible to receive reimbursable tax credits.</p>\n<p>Those with fewer than 50 employees who are interested in applying for an exemption to the paid leave mandate because the viability of their business may be in jeopardy should reach out to the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p><strong>Are the Paid Leave Benefits Permanent?</strong><br />\nThe sick leave benefits included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act will only last through December 31, 2020.<sup><em>3</em></sup></p>\n<p><strong>When Does It Take Effect?</strong><br />\nThe recently passed bill was signed into law on March 18, 2020, and the paid leave provisions are expected to take effect within 15 days.<sup><em>2</em></sup> As we continue to see global increases in illnesses and deaths, the United States government is being urged to continue on the path of providing for America’s workforce.</p>\n<p>Guidelines will be issued for the Families First Coronavirus Response Act in order to assist employers in calculating how much paid leave their employees should receive. At that point, workers should be able to simply inform their employers of time off, take their leave and receive payment specified by the law.</p>\n<p><sub>1. https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/</sub><br />\n<sub>2. https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201/text</sub><br />\n<sub>3. https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-and-labor-announce-plan-to-implement-coronavirus-related-paid-leave-for-workers-and-tax-credits-for-small-and-midsize-businesses-to-swiftly-recover-the-cost-of-providing-coronavirus</sub></p>\n<p><em>This content may not be used for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties.

In order to prevent this, don’t ever give out personal information to anyone you don’t know over the phone.  The IRS never makes initial contact with taxpayers via an unsolicited phone call and never asks for personal information over the phone.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Phishing is another way that fraudsters use e-mails, text messages, websites and social media to bait taxpayers into providing their personal information or clicking a compromised link that can then be used to install malware onto a computer or other device.  These crooks often pose as a legitimate organization, such as a bank, credit card company or government organization like the IRS and might promise a big refund or personally threaten you. Don’t ever open attachments or click on links in suspicious e-mails. The IRS generally only contacts people by mail.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another form of tax fraud is identity theft.  This occurs when thieves typically steal a Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number to file a fraudulent return claiming a tax refund.  If a thief claims a refund in your name, you still will get a proper tax refund, but it will take time and a lot of paperwork.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is also important to do your research in order to avoid fraudulent accountants.  There are scammers who pose as tax professionals and rip off customers via refund fraud, identity theft and other schemes.  These criminals typically promise overly large tax refunds to prey on older Americans, low-income taxpayers and non-English speakers.  Make sure to Visit the <a title=\"https://www.bbb.org/\" href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Business Bureau’s website</a> to run a check.

You should revisit your W-4 whenever you have a major personal life change. As we have written in the past, the potential for both a tax bill and a tax refund should be zero, or close to it. However, if you count on a big tax refund every year, pay attention to your withholding because it directly impacts your refund.  You can adjust your W-4 at any time throughout the year, but if you do it later in the year, there will be less impact on your taxes for that year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need any assistance with your taxes or updating your W-4, you should speak to a professional.  We are happy to provide you with CPA recommendations if you would like.

Although “rollover” is a term widely used to mean moving money from one retirement account to another.  That money is best moved by direct transfer, but some employers will send a check. You have 60 days to roll that money over to an IRA or other qualified plan. If you miss that window, there is a grace period (with a penalty fee), but this is offered only once every 12 months. It’s best to do a direct transfer to avoid this becoming a problem.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Don’t assume an IRA is best.  </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of good reasons to move your money into an IRA (individual retirement account).  These accounts aren’t linked to any one employer and consolidate your money into a single retirement account.  However, your employer’s plan may offer you access to investment options, tools and institutional pricing that you might not get with an IRA.  In addition, the creditor protection for IRAs varies by state and might not be as secure as a 401(k) option.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Make sure to not overlook other tax strategies.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be other strategies to consider when weighing a job move, although most people associate 401(k) plans with pretax contribution. One option may be to convert the savings to a Roth IRA; you’ll owe income taxes on what you convert, but future growth and withdrawals will be tax free. If your income is lower that year, the tax impact will be less.  For those who’ve accumulated their employer’s stock in their 401(k) plans, leaving a job may open the door for an often overlooked tax break. Normally, distributions from a tax-deferred retirement account are taxed as ordinary income. Under the so-called “net unrealized appreciation” break, you can opt to withdraw your employer’s stock as shares. You’ll owe ordinary income tax on the cost basis, but not on any gains. When you sell the shares down the road, you’ll owe capital-gains tax just on the shares’ appreciation.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we enter the 4th quarter, and you may have received all your September 30th statements from all your old 401k plans, use this opportunity as  a good time to evaluate and understand what you have and you options. Keeping regular tabs on what is going on with your investments is critical to ensuring they line up with your goals for the future.  </span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2,"src":"/static/fb24b3c286983930b720331fbd63cfdd/da113/401k-blog-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fb24b3c286983930b720331fbd63cfdd/3f132/401k-blog-image.jpg 100w,\n/static/fb24b3c286983930b720331fbd63cfdd/8850c/401k-blog-image.jpg 200w,\n/static/fb24b3c286983930b720331fbd63cfdd/da113/401k-blog-image.jpg 400w,\n/static/fb24b3c286983930b720331fbd63cfdd/7223d/401k-blog-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/fb24b3c286983930b720331fbd63cfdd/f2cbb/401k-blog-image.jpg 800w,\n/static/fb24b3c286983930b720331fbd63cfdd/52a0e/401k-blog-image.jpg 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"e0c7cbdf-20f1-5b8b-9179-9f1bc2e0ef70","slug":"are-you-ready-for-a-recession-a-survey-says-probably-not","title":"Are you ready for a recession?

The Fed has cut rates twice this year to cushion the economy and experts are betting that there might be another cut as well when the Fed meets again in 2 weeks.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what can you do to make sure you are prepared for a recession if it were to happen?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you should pay off high-interest debts and boost your emergency savings. An emergency fund is key if an economic downturn leaves you strapped for cash or a potential loss of income.  Americans should also cut down on overall spending. You might want to consider having funds automatically put into a savings account from each paycheck.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As to be expected, those with higher incomes feel more secure about their financial position if a recession were to occur.  Those that are more comfortable financially have the ability to look ahead and tend to be more goal-oriented. Typically, those that can pay their bills without much concern also have the ability to be more mindful of their spending and can build their savings funds to better prepare in the event of a job loss or other emergency.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those living paycheck-to-paycheck, it is much more difficult to prepare for a downturn.  At a minimum, limiting any “wants” and putting aside even an extra $1 a day can be helpful is starting to build that emergency fund.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a strong financial mindset is the most important factor in trying to save for an economic downfall.  You should limit what you spend and control what you save. Being proactive about your money, instead of reactive, will put you in a better position to prepare for downside risk. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can&#8217;t tell you when the next recession will happen with any accuracy. Neither can the TV pundits or even the best economists. But we know that it will happen again. Real businesses will fail. Start with a plan based on your individual situation, prioritizing the following things:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building up emergency savings and paying off expensive debt</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximizing your professional value and prospects</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allocating your portfolio based on your goals and not on how the market is doing right now</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your priorities and the plan you make will be unique to you. But once you put it into action, it should help you minimize the harm from a recession, bounce back quickly, and even grow your wealth.

Financial stress not only leads to anxiety for many, but is also one of the key factors that can lead to conflicts in a relationship. Finding alignment on money matters should be a top priority in any serious relationship (and may help you sleep better at night as well!), but many struggle with finding ways to have these important conversations. Here are five money-related issues that anyone in a long-term relationship should avoid:</p>\n<p>1. Financial Infidelity &#8211; Dishonesty about money issues is a very common problem and is a key factor in ending a relationship. Whether lying about purchases or hiding massive credit card debt, holding back on financial information is lead to massive trust issues in any relationship. Partners should find a way to talk openly about their financial situation before it leads to problems in the future.</p>\n<p>2. Being too controlling or judgmental &#8211; Feeling like your significant other is stopping you from buying things you want can often lead to serious problems in a relationship. It is helpful to decide on an amount of money that each partner can spend with no questions asked and don&#8217;t judge the things your partner might want to purchase. Make this amount something that works within the budget of your relationship so it doesn&#8217;t lead to further issues down the line.</p>\n<p>3. Not talking about your finances regularly &#8211; Talking money might often lead to arguments, but it&#8217;s imperative not to avoid these conversations. These discussions should be about budgeting, setting joint financial goals and finding ways to agree on what to spend and save.</p>\n<p>4. Refusing to Compromise &#8211; Both partners in a relationship need to realize they might not always get their way when it comes to money. You should continue to discuss financial matters until you can come to an agreement on something that works for BOTH.</p>\n<p>5. Failing to Set Joint Financial Goals &#8211; It is extremely important for couples to set financial goals that they both agree on. If you are both in agreement on what your needs/wants are, then there is less likely to be an issue when it comes to deciding what to spend money on.</p>\n<p>The keys to successful relationships regarding financial issues are transparency, setting clear goals and compromise. Keeping the conversations flowing regarding money matters is integral to a healthy relationship. As relationships continue to change and evolve, it’s important to continue to have these discussions in an ongoing fashion. Keep experimenting with different methods until you find one that works best for you and your significant other and remember to always try to keep an open mind. These discussions might just be the key to a better night’s sleep AND a more successful and happier relationship.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.8,"src":"/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/da113/IMG_0006-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/3f132/IMG_0006-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/8850c/IMG_0006-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/da113/IMG_0006-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/7223d/IMG_0006-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/f2cbb/IMG_0006-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/88d35/IMG_0006-1.jpg 1440w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"ff101b9b-6f66-58fa-becc-0263ab2d421c","slug":"cfp-delays-enforcement-of-their-new-fiduciary-standards","title":"CFP Delays Enforcement of Their New Fiduciary Standards","content":"<p><iframe title=\"Sherman Wealth | CFP Delays Their Fiduciary Standards\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYNTKWSX2oM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc. (CFP) states that their new fiduciary standards will be delayed, pushing the enforcement of these important ethics back to June 30, 2020. With this news comes questions about the quality of service people can expect from those handling their money, and what this all means to them in the long run.</p>\n<p>The CFP started reviewing their standards almost four years ago, in an effort to identify areas for improvement. Their code of ethics and standards of conduct, which were approved last year, require that all CFPs and brokers act in the best interests of their clients when providing financial advice. This is in contrast to the established set of standards that only required client advocacy with regards to their financial planning. With the current rule, if a CFP is not providing elements of financial planning, then they do not need to place their clients’ interests ahead of their own<strong>. </strong>It can come as a shock to many that those tasked with handling their money are not necessarily obligated to act in the best interest of investing it.</p>\n<p>When you start to appreciate the significance of these standards or lack thereof, you can see why the CFP&#8217;s decision to delay enforcement has many concerned. Currently, the CFP has 85,000 financial advisors certified under their current standards. When you factor in that many planners with a CFP designation have multiple clients with varying amounts of money under their management, you can start to see the magnitude of all this.</p>\n<p>To be a fiduciary means to act in the best interest of your clients. To uphold the integrity of such a title means that there cannot be any motivation of profiteering off clients in the interest of personal gain. A fiduciary is always to provide advice which is in the best interest of their clients.</p>\n<p>The world of finance can be a tricky landscape to negotiate. We use money every day, and it touches upon every aspect of our life, direct or indirect.</p>\n<p>That in mind, it&#8217;s important to consider regulations that may seem distant to us at face-value, but do in fact have a genuine impact on our wellbeing. Consider all this when you assess who handles your money. Huge firms that employ many advisors with the CFP designation were in fact the ones pushing for the delayment of the new fiduciary standards, stating that many of them needed more time to make the necessary business adjustments. The fact that they must alter their business strategies in order to incorporate stricter fiduciary standards proves that they have not consistently been acting in their clients best interest all along. An independent financial planner has the advantage of weighing all the options available to their clients, without being mandated to sell internal financial products. It’s characteristics like this that uphold the definition of a fiduciary, and help maintain the integrity associated with the term. Always be sure to take the time to consider these important characteristics, so that your financial wellbeing has as much integrity as those who are handling it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8867924528301887,"src":"/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/da113/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/3f132/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/8850c/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/da113/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/7223d/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/f2cbb/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/c26c2/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"ea710237-65ba-582a-9517-3a3075184c7e","slug":"how-to-plan-for-summer-activities-and-budget","title":"How to Plan For Summer Activities and Budget","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope everyone had a great Memorial Day Weekend filled with fun, sun and lots of good food and pool time.  We took our kids to Washington DC to pay respects and educate them on the brave men and women that lost their lives fighting for our freedom.  As parents, lots of the chatter we’ve heard this past Memorial Day weekend centered around our kids. Whether exhausted from all the spring sports (both physically and financially) or trying to figure out what to do with the kids this summer, many of us are all in the same boat.   For those of us that work full-time or part-time, it is necessary to find coverage for our kids during the summer without breaking the bank &#8211; certainly no easy feat! Most summer camps do offer before and after care, but it’s an at an additional cost after already paying the pricey sticker price of a week of camp. For those that have a parent that stays home with the kids, there is the question of “how much camp can we justify spending on” or “what activities can we do with our kids each week without spending a fortune?”  There are no right answers to these questions, but there are ways to help reduce the stress of the financial burden of summer break. First, making a family budget that includes setting aside money for whatever your summer plans are is a MUST, and don’t forget to include some vacation funds too. Another way to save is to browse sites like Living Social, Certifikid and Groupon for deals on summer camps and other activities. There are also many great free or inexpensive options through your local recreation departments &#8211; look into classes offered at nature centers, libraries and aquatic facilities. These things may not take the  financial stress out of summer, but with a little proactive planning, you might just be able to make the costs a little easier to swallow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another of the major kid/life stressors that was a topic of conversation this past weekend is the growing cost of keeping our kids involved in sports.  A new survey finds that 27% of &#8220;sports parents&#8221; are spending $500 or more each month on their children&#8217;s activities.  Even though most of us realize our kids aren’t likely going to be the next LeBron James or Tom Brady, we still want to give them every opportunity to succeed with any sport they might have interest in. Whether that means enrolling them in specialized pitching clinics or joining the club soccer team, the bottom line is that it means spending hundreds, if not thousands, each month in registration fees, uniforms and new equipment, not to mention the gas and wear &amp; tear on our cars getting them to practice, tournaments and team-bonding events throughout the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A recent survey finds that sports parents spend twice as much time on their children’s activities than they do on financial planning. To keep money priorities straight, it is recommended that parents commit to a plan.  According to Dara Luber, senior manager of retirement at TD Ameritrade, you should “start by identifying your financial goals and creating savings buckets for each of them — your retirement, your children&#8217;s education, vacations and sports, to name a few. Be sure to fund those priorities in order of importance, putting your retirement first, Luber said. Then, have regular budget meetings with your family, so that your children understand the trade-offs of participating in costly sports programs, such as forgoing a family vacation.” There is nothing wrong with helping your son or daughter realize their sports dreams, but it definitely shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of your own retirement or understate your family&#8217;s needs,&#8221; Luber said.

We’d also love to be able to send them to whatever camp they desire, for weeks on end, but that’s not always realistic either.   Before we spend more money than necessary on these types of things, we must be honest with ourselves with what our future goals are. Teaching our children the importance of saving over spending and wants vs. needs. will benefit everyone in the family. With some strategic planning, you might just be able to take the vacation of your dreams or send them to that special once in a lifetime camp that they’ve been begging for.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7518796992481203,"src":"/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/da113/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/3f132/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/8850c/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/da113/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/7223d/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/f2cbb/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/313d6/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 1536w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"d15dce9a-2f81-5003-8a00-05c558e7b724","slug":"lack-of-financial-literacy-in-americas-schools","title":"LACK OF FINANCIAL LITERACY IN AMERICA’S SCHOOLS","content":"<p>“According to <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5233033/average-debt-every-age/\">Money</a>, the average millennial household &#8220;owes $14,800 in student loans.&#8221; Writer Kerri Anne Renzulli explains that while debt averages vary across each generation, people of all ages are demonstrating a greater comfort with debt.

Growing up, I was involved with Junior Achievement in high school and jumped at the opportunity to be included in this experience with some 7<sup>th</sup> graders from Briggs Chaney Middle School. As part of this program, I spoke to the students about managing debt, establishing credit, the benefit of low interest rates on your monthly payments, and the idea of “wants vs. needs.”   In today’s world, many adults still struggle with these concepts and even many Wharton students lack a basic financial education.(<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/even-mba-students-could-use-some-basic-money-lessons.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/even-mba-students-could-use-some-basic-money-lessons.html</a>).

Powell knocked that idea, by explaining that the central bank still sees the weakness as the result of “transitory” factors, such as portfolio management services, lower apparel prices and airfares.  The Fed’s target on inflation is 2%, and the core PCE rate watched by the Fed fell to a surprising 1.6% in the first quarter.&#8221;   President Donald Trump, who earlier this week urged the Fed to cut the rate by 1 percentage point was most likely frustrated with the Fed chair as well.</p>\n<p>Since the Fed did not indicate which direction the next move may be, this is a good time to review any variable interest rates you have (student loans, etc.). Use this opportunity to pay down these types of<br />\ndebts and boost your savings cushions. And, for those of you who might be getting tax refunds,<br />\nyou may want to think about using that money to add to your savings or pay down debt.<br />\nAs your April 30 bank statements come in, this is an opportune time to re-evaluate your<br />\nchecking and savings accounts. If you aren’t earning at least 2% for your short-term goals, you<br />\nshould be looking into some new options.</p>\n<p>With some mortgage rates are at a low of 3.125%, there are hopes that this will continue to<br />\nstimulate the housing market. It’s also a good time to look at your current mortgage rate. If<br />\nyou have an ARM that’s expiring (adjustable rate mortgage), now is good time to consider<br />\nwhether it might be worth converting that to a fixed rate mortgage. Now is the time to take advantage of lower long term rates that may not be here forever.</p>\n<p>We feel that Greg McBride at BankRate sums it up best in this tweet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr valign=\"bottom\">\n<td width=\"48\"><img class=\"CToWUd\" src=\"https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/s_3GCwQcvpO-4PjcedB5kU8FByfHwY9UQtlCwop8yaRfSY5pUxX4hnlZkXb98bFaQEhDT3bnD51uMI45mKftF-ZJBn5iUIUKVW7O8zz2nVOl9Wp9aT90iSFlnxK5hA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/694291009749016579/-rnMsMwy_normal.jpg\" /></td>\n<td><b>Greg McBride, CFA (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankrategreg?s=11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/bankrategreg?s%3D11&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556896148496000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGei2C391g4gcM-Q0PR-fEHLwqAbQ\">@BankrateGreg</a>)</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<div><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankrategreg/status/1123652625294090241?s=11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/bankrategreg/status/1123652625294090241?s%3D11&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556896148497000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHF0fKabZ4ram4Kf2pkeBaf1idYRg\">5/1/19, 2:17 PM</a></div>\n<div>For consumers, the reprieve from rising rates will continue.

As the month of April is Financial Literacy Month, this was a great time for me to help make an impact in increasing the financial literacy among students. These students have the privilege of taking a business and finance course at the high school level. They are already much more advanced in their understanding of business operation and level of financial understanding than the majority of this country. As of 2019, 19 states require high school students to study financial literacy before earning a diploma, which is up from 17 in 2018 and 13 in 2011. It is great to see this progress year to year. At the business Pitch challenge, I listened to the students’ pitch which included a deep analysis of revenue, profit margin, and expenses of their business idea: a drone delivery service, which would deliver packages from door to door.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I encouraged the students to deepen their analysis by cutting costs through changing their business model from serving as a manufacturing company to serving as a software as a service business. This way, the company would be able to cut down on high fixed costs and focus on driving recurring revenue. The important thing to note is that the students were able to hold a discussion on cost-benefit analysis, while most high school students could not due to their limited understanding of financial metrics. Whether the Drone package delivery service would become a million -dollar company or not, these students have won the lottery by attending a school that would allow them to study finance before the rest of their peers across the country. The earlier students start to understand this material, the better. As they reach college and beyond, it is crucial that they become financially literate, which will make them financially smarter. It is crucial that young adults are able to make potentially complex decisions about student loans, mortgages, credit, and managing retirement-savings accounts. According to research studies, on average, students in states that require financial literacy courses in high school have lower credit card balances and pay for college using lower cost student loans than students living in states without this mandate. States with the mandate to incorporate financial literacy courses into the curriculum have seen an overall improvement in credit scores and a lower rate of late payments on credit cards among young adults. This shows how important it is for students to begin increasing their financial literacy as early as high school.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a financial advisory firm, Sherman Wealth is a big proponent of starting to increase financial literacy at an early age. We are excited that students in Montgomery county are working to increase their understanding of business strategy and financial information, which is what we think will help them long term. This is why I was excited to be a part of the business pitch competition and help coach the students into developing strategic ideas and better their business model</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.492537313432836,"src":"/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/6e883/unnamed-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/3f132/unnamed-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/8850c/unnamed-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/6e883/unnamed-1.jpg 275w","sizes":"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px"}}}}}}]},"allPosts":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"news-resources","pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":33,"numberOfPages":6,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":"/news-resources/2"}}}
