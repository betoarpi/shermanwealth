On March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law, allocating funding to support the U.S. economy and workers through the coronavirus outbreak.</div>\n<p>The legislation includes a number of proposals aimed at supporting small businesses.<em><sup>1</sup></em> For those hit hard due to forced closures and a sharp downturn in foot traffic, this bill may provide some relief.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What Does the Package Include?</strong></span></p>\n<p>American small businesses are supported by the recently passed CARES Act in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A $350 billion forgivable loan program (The Paycheck Protection Program) designed to encourage small businesses from laying off employees.</li>\n<li>A delay in employer-side payroll taxes for Social Security until 2021 and 2022.</li>\n<li>50 percent refundable payroll tax credit on worker wages to incentivize businesses, including those with fewer than 500 employees, to retain their current workforce.</li>\n<li>Sole proprietors and other self-employed workers may be eligible for the expanded unemployment insurance benefits the bill provides.</li>\n<li>A portion of the $425 billion in funds appropriated for the Federal Reserve’s credit facilities will target small businesses.<em><sup>2</sup></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How Does the $350 Billion Paycheck Protection Program Work?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Under the stimulus package, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will oversee the Paycheck Protection Program. This program will distribute $350 billion to small businesses that meet certain requirements, and the loans will be made available to companies with 500 or fewer employees.<em><sup>3 </sup></em></p>\n<p>Businesses can receive loans up to $10 million, and these loans will be administered by banks and other lenders. Additionally, the Paycheck Protection loans will carry a maximum interest rate of up to just four percent.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p>Currently, the SBA guarantees small business loans that are distributed by a network of more than 800 lenders across the country. The program creates a form of emergency loan that has the potential to be forgiven when used to maintain payroll through June of 2020. In order for the above amounts to be forgiven, the business must maintain the same number of employees (equivalents) in the eight weeks following the date of origination of the loan as it did from either February 15, 2019 through June 30, 2019, or from January 1, 2020 through February 29, 2020.<sup><em>1</em></sup> The program also expands the network beyond the SBA so that more banks, credit unions and lenders can issue the appropriate loans.</p>\n<p>If your business uses the loan funds for the approved purposes and maintains the average size of your full-time workforce based on when you received the loan, the principal loan will be forgiven, meaning you will only need to pay back the interest accrued.<em><sup>2</sup></em> The primary purpose of these loans is to incentivize small businesses to refrain from laying off workers and ultimately rehire laid-off employees that have already lost jobs due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What Types of Businesses Are Eligible For The Paycheck Protection Program?</strong></span></p>\n<p>The Paycheck Protection Program offers loans for small businesses with fewer than 500 employees, 501(c)(3) nonprofits with fewer than 500 workers and some 501(c)(19) veteran organizations. Food service businesses are also eligible if they employ fewer than 500 people per physical location.<em><sup>1 </sup></em></p>\n<p>Self-employed individuals, sole proprietors and freelance or gig economy workers are also eligible to apply for financial assistance during this time. Even without a personal guarantee or collateral, businesses that are struggling can receive a loan as long as they were operational on February 15, 2020.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>Eligible borrowers are required to make a good-faith certification that the loan is necessary due to the uncertainty of current economic conditions caused by COVID-19.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How Do I Get a Payroll Protection Loan?</strong></span></p>\n<p>The loan program will provide loans through SBA-approved private lenders. As banks are currently working on implementing this program, it’s important to check with your local bank to see where they’re at in the process. Those that are already approved by the Small Business Association may be quicker to put the loan program into place.</p>\n<p>As a small business owner or self-employed individual, it’s always important to be aware of your options during challenging times. By using some of the new programs recently enacted, and the promise of keeping your workers employed, your small business can continue to thrive.</p>\n<p>As always, if you have any questions related to The Paycheck Protection Program or if you have other concerns, please<a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\"> reach out</a> &#8211; we are here for you!</p>\n<ol>\n<li><cite><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585932807220000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1aamI_eoWMKckj9H314eMQ6euRw\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/<wbr />116th-congress/house-bill/748/<wbr />text</a></cite></li>\n<li><cite><a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CARES%20Section-by-Section%20FINAL.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CARES%2520Section-by-Section%2520FINAL.PDF&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585932807220000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTcCNX30vBhi-ibN7wRMrArWnfNQ\">https://www.help.senate.gov/<wbr />imo/media/doc/CARES%20Section-<wbr />by-Section%20FINAL.PDF</a></cite></li>\n<li><cite><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585932807220000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFefHuehcbYvEMHiTQCJrJOkyZwpg\">https://www.npr.org/2020/03/<wbr />26/821457551/whats-inside-the-<wbr />senate-s-2-trillion-<wbr />coronavirus-aid-package</a></cite></li>\n</ol>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9385665529010239,"src":"/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/26a4d/ppp.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/4e5cc/ppp.jpg 100w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/5398f/ppp.jpg 200w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/26a4d/ppp.jpg 400w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/897d1/ppp.jpg 600w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/57238/ppp.jpg 800w,\n/static/4a15c50294ee41ed4dcbb25e836f4da7/95245/ppp.jpg 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c95a8d93-a0ac-5e3e-a04a-622215e582c2","slug":"the-new-401k-no-penalty-withdrawals-in-the-cares-act","title":"The New 401(k) No-Penalty Withdrawals in the CARES Act","content":"<p>As part of the CARES Act, some of the rules about taking money out of your 401(k) are being temporarily lifted to help people affected by the coronavirus pandemic. While the added flexibility may help some ride out the crisis, there is some concern that some might be tempted to take out huge sums now—and, as a result, either put their eventual retirements in jeopardy or possibly leave themselves with a big tax bill.</p>\n<p>Here is some important information regarding what has changed and how to approach your 401(k) as it relates to these changes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What is a coronavirus-related 401(k) distribution? Is it really a no-penalty withdrawal?</strong></span></p>\n<p>One provision of the CARES Act relaxes the rules for taking money from your 401(k). Investors of any age can take out a &#8220;coronavirus-related distribution&#8221; of as much as $100,000 (or up to 100% of the balance) without paying early withdrawal penalties. The act also increases the maximum &#8220;loan&#8221; from your 401k to this amount (previously that was limited to $50,000 or 50% of an employee&#8217;s balance).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Who is eligible for a 401(k) coronavirus-related distribution?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Your company&#8217;s 401(k) plan sponsor will determine whether coronavirus-related distributions will be permitted, whether you meet the criteria for this type of distribution, and whether the amount you request fits the hardship you are facing.  Anyone who has contracted the virus, has had a spouse or a dependent contract the virus, or has experienced financial hardship because of it, would be considered eligible.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Is a coronavirus-related 401(k) distribution a loan?</strong></span></p>\n<p data-inc=\"1\">No. Unlike a 401(k) loan that must be repaid, a coronavirus-related distribution does not need to be repaid. Employees can repay the distribution within three years without regard to annual contribution limits for their 401(k) plans, and that the repayment does not need to be made all at once. Any repayment of the distribution would be treated as a &#8220;rollover contribution&#8221; to the plan. But, any employee who takes a coronavirus-related distribution and does not pay it back will owe tax on the amount, through they will be able to pay the taxes owed over a three-year period.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Is it a good idea to take this new 401(k) distribution?</strong></span></p>\n<p>You should only take distribution from your 401(k) now if it&#8217;s your only option. The point of a 401(k) is that you are investing the money over a long-term period, so that the power of compound interest works in your favor throughout your career. So, since you&#8217;ll likely have to liquidate stocks to take money out now, this means selling when the market is down significantly.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Should I take my regular 401(k) distribution this year?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Another major provision under the CARES Act, is that required minimum distributions (RMDs) have been waived this year. If you can afford it, you should take advantage of not taking the distribution this year.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What if I take a 401(k) coronavirus-related distribution and then get laid off or furloughed?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Typically, if you take a loan from your 401(k) and then leave your company, you usually have to pay the money back immediately, or else it is considered a taxable distribution. But under the CARES Act, if an employee takes a coronavirus-related distribution and then leaves the company, the employee would not have to pay the distribution back.</p>\n<p>If you are laid off, furloughed, or your hours are cut, you can only contribute to your 410(k) if you are still getting a paycheck. Also, if employees are being paid emergency sick leave or expanded family and medical leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), those payments <em>are</em> eligible for salary reduction contributions to a 401(k) plan.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How is a 401(k) coronavirus-related distribution different from a hardship distribution?</strong></span></p>\n<p data-inc=\"2\">Most plans allow for &#8220;hardship distributions&#8221; in, say, the case of a major medical event. But these differ from the current coronavirus-related distributions since they are taxed in the year taken, cannot be repaid to the plan, and are limited to the amount necessary to meet the financial need.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Should I keep contributing to my 401(k)?</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you can keep up contributions—or even increase them—during this time, you should.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>What are the 401(k) contribution limits for 2020?</strong></span></p>\n<p>At the end of last year, <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19500-for-2020-catch-up-limit-rises-to-6500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the IRS announced</a> that for 2020, the maximum contribution for individuals in 2020 would be raised to $19,500. The so-called &#8220;catch-up&#8221; contribution for employees age 50 and over was raised to $6,500. The limits on annual contributions to an IRA remained unchanged at $6,000 per year.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Does my employer have to keep providing a 401(k) contribution match?</strong></span></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing in the CARES Act that addresses this.  Employers can amend their 401(k) plans to stop making matching contributions and they should promptly notify employees of any changes.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions relating to your 401(k) or have other concerns about your finances, please feel free to <a href=\"https://shermanwealth.com/contact-us/\">call us</a> &#8211; we&#8217;re here for you during these challenging times.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9385665529010239,"src":"/static/d91cf0ee336bb504a0d2678b5358ab6a/26a4d/401k.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d91cf0ee336bb504a0d2678b5358ab6a/4e5cc/401k.jpg 100w,\n/static/d91cf0ee336bb504a0d2678b5358ab6a/5398f/401k.jpg 200w,\n/static/d91cf0ee336bb504a0d2678b5358ab6a/26a4d/401k.jpg 400w,\n/static/d91cf0ee336bb504a0d2678b5358ab6a/897d1/401k.jpg 600w,\n/static/d91cf0ee336bb504a0d2678b5358ab6a/57238/401k.jpg 800w,\n/static/d91cf0ee336bb504a0d2678b5358ab6a/95245/401k.jpg 1136w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c194ce47-c740-52c1-8adf-7b5f83653e6b","slug":"here-are-some-ways-the-stimulus-package-may-change-your-retirement-planning","title":"Here are Some Ways the Stimulus Package May Change Your Retirement Planning","content":"<p>The $2 trillion economic relief plan impacts almost every layer of American life, including your retirement plan.</p>\n<p>Here are some important components all workers currently saving for retirement and retirees need to know.</p>\n<p><strong>Required Minimum Distributions are suspended for 2020 for IRA’s and workplace plans.</strong></p>\n<p>The formulas for these distributions were calculated on 12/31 when the market was much higher than it is currently, so investors would have been forced to sell stocks that had substantially depreciated.

It comes after a series of announcements by the U.S. Department of Education meant to alleviate student loan stress. The new law takes that relief even further.  The biggest break is that you can stop making payments on most federal student loans for six months — from April through September — and no new interest will accrue. That means, at the end of those six months, you’ll owe exactly what you did at the start.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congress didn’t wipe out any of your student debt, but it gave everyone a six-month payment holiday, regardless of how much they have or haven’t been hurt by the current wave of layoffs and closings designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus.  In addition, the stimulus package expands on and supersedes earlier relief programs Specifically, here’s how the new stimulus affects your student loans, and what to do if you’re in each of the situations below.</span></p>\n<p><strong>1. If You’re Current But Likely To Fall Behin</strong><strong>d</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you are able to pay your bill currently, but you’re concerned about losing income or affording payments in the next few months, you should take advantage of automatic student loan forbearance starting now.  Use it to build an emergency fund so that you can put it toward other essentials like food and housing in the future if necessary.</span></p>\n<p><b>2. If You’re Working Toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stimulus bill updates certain details regarding Public Service Loan Forgiveness. If you don’t make payments until Sept. 30, those months will still count toward your Public Service Loan Forgiveness timeline. That means you won’t have to make payments for extra months, past the time you planned to get forgiveness so even if you can keep paying loans, it doesn’t make sense to do so. If and when you do qualify for PSLF, you’ll receive forgiveness on the outstanding balance without needing to pay income tax on the amount forgiven.</span></p>\n<p><b>3. If You’re Current On Student Loan Payments And Your Income Is Secure</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t have to make payments right now, but since new interest won’t accrue, any payments you do make will be turbocharged. More of your payment will go toward your principal balance, helping you pay off the loan faster. If you’re not concerned about your income or shoring up savings at the moment, your best bet is to continue making payments while you can.</span></p>\n<p><b>4. If You’re Behind On Student Loan Payments</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borrowers who were more than 31 days behind on their loans receive automatic forbearance and now your payments are automatically postponed until Sept. 30. You don’t need to ask for forbearance from your student loan servicer, but it’s a smart idea to check your online account soon to make sure they’ve updated their records. Interest won’t accrue during this period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. Department of Education has also announced that:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collections activities will be paused, meaning you shouldn’t receive calls or letters about a federal loan in default that a private company is now collecting on.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The government will not withhold your pay, your tax refund or your Social Security payment — known as Treasury offsets — for at least 60 days if you’re in default, starting from March 13. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re in a rehabilitation program to get out of default, which requires you to make nine on-time student loan payments in 10 months, the clock doesn’t stop on your payment arrangement. Even if you don’t make payments for the next six months, those months will still be counted toward your rehabilitation timeline.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re worried you’ll need help after the pause on payments has ended, you can sign up for an income-driven repayment plan to limit your monthly bill to a percentage of your income for as long as you need to. You’ll also get forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of payments, and you’ll pay income tax on the forgiven balance. </span></p>\n<p><b>5. If You’re A Parent With Student Loans On Behalf Of A Child</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you took out federal direct PLUS loans to help your child pay for college, these are included as part of the stimulus package’s relief offerings. That means your payments will be suspended automatically until Sept. 30. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can continue to make payments, you’ll benefit from the fact that new interest isn’t being charged during this six month period. That means all payments you make during this period go directly toward your principal balance, potentially helping you pay off your loan quicker. </span></p>\n<h2><b>6. If You Have Commercially-Held FFEL Or School-Held Perkins Loans</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only loans held by the U.S. Department of Education qualify for relief in the stimulus package, including the interest waiver and payment suspension. Loans from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program that are owned by private entities, and Perkins loans owned by colleges, don’t qualify. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you can consolidate these loans into a direct consolidation loan in order to access stimulus benefits. Consolidating also lets you take advantage of income-driven repayment if you need it in the future. But if you have Perkins loans, that means giving up access to certain forgiveness programs for public service workers and other benefits. Weigh the pros and cons before consolidating.</span></p>\n<p><b>7. If You Have Private Student Loans</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal relief programs DO NOT apply to borrowers with private student loans. That means it’s up to you to call your lender and ask about loan modification programs, which many offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re at risk of falling behind on loan payments, request help from your lender as soon as possible. You can ask about options for reducing or pausing payments and waiving late fees. </span></p>\n<p><b>8. If You Don’t Know Where To Start</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is most important to know what type of student loans you have so you know whether you can confidently stop making payments or not. Most student loans are federally held, so if you’re unsure, start by signing in to StudentAid.gov with your Federal Student Aid ID, or </span><a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/account-info\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create an account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you know you have student loans but they’re not listed there, the loans may be private. All your loans will be listed on your credit report, so if not listed on StudentAid.gov, they are likely private. You can check your credit report for free once a year from each of the three main credit bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com.</span></p>\n<p>As always, if you have any questions relating to your student

Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act</a>. Spreading $2 trillion amongst businesses, hospitals, families and individuals, this economic stimulus package is designed to bring relief to those experiencing the ever-increasing threat of economic turmoil and downturn amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>After six days of back and forth between Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House, all parties came to an agreement on this historical $2 trillion package. For perspective, this relief package greatly surpasses the $168 billion offered to Americans in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which was the last time an economic stimulus package was passed.<em><sup>1</sup> </em></p>\n<p>If you’re wondering how this newly passed act may affect you, your place of employment or your local healthcare facility, we’ve gathered up the important numbers to know in this overview.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Unemployment Benefits</strong></span></p>\n<p>In an effort to extend unemployment benefits, eligible Americans on unemployment will receive an additional $600 per week for four months.<em><sup>2</sup></em> This is done in an effort to help those who are currently out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic better achieve their full pay over the next four months.</p>\n<p>This bill will allow unemployed individuals affected by the pandemic to receive unemployment insurance for an extended 13 weeks. In addition, it will allow out-of-work individuals to receive the enhanced unemployment benefits as outlined in this bill for four months.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>The bill has called for the creation of a pandemic unemployment assistant program that would offer unemployment benefits to those who have previously not been eligible &#8211; including those who have been furloughed by their employer, freelancers and gig workers (such as Uber or Lyft drivers).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Healthcare Aid</strong></span></p>\n<p>In the final iteration of the bill, hospitals will receive around $117 billion in aid.<em><sup>2</sup></em> In regards to helping healthcare workers on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bill is meant to help workers gain better access to protective equipment, testing supplies and provide construction or facilities to house the growing number of patients in need.</p>\n<p>Additionally, hospitals and healthcare providers will see a 20 percent increase in Medicare payments for treating those on Medicare with coronavirus.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Stimulus Checks</strong></span></p>\n<p>Some American taxpayers will be receiving direct stimulus payments of $1,200 as part of the new bill. Those with incomes up to $75,000 will receive the full $1,200, with the amount lowering and eventually phasing out for those who earn more than $99,000. Individuals earning $99,000 or couples earning $198,000 or more will not receive checks. Families who qualify with children can expect to receive an additional $500 in direct payments per child.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>To determine how much you will receive, the government will be basing your income level on your 2018 tax return, unless you have already filed your 2019 tax return.<em><sup>2</sup></em> As a reminder, the tax filing deadline has been extended to July 15, 2020.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Small Business Grants &amp; Loans</strong></span></p>\n<p>A large portion of this stimulus bill will be going toward assisting small businesses who have been affected greatly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, $500 billion will go toward assisting businesses and corporations, with $29 billion going to the aviation industry and $17 billion to businesses that work in national security. The remaining $454 billion can be leveraged as loans for other businesses or municipalities. Companies that choose to take this government assistance must agree to stop any stock buybacks for the length of the loan plus a year. In addition, these companies must retain at least 90 percent of their employee levels between March 24 and September 30, 2020.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>This money will be overseen by an inspector general and a five-person panel, who Congress will appoint. In addition, any businesses run or partially run (at least 20 percent stake in the company) by the Trump family, or other senior government officials, will not be eligible to use these funds.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Education</strong></span></p>\n<p>Millions of educators and students from K-12 through college have been affected by government orders to self-isolate. In an effort to assist school systems and institutions across the country, the government is granting $30 billion in emergency education funding.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>In addition, The Department of Education will be suspending payments so that borrowers would be allowed to put off paying their federal student loan payments without penalty until September 30th.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Airlines</strong></span></p>\n<p>Airlines have been hit hard during the pandemic and requested government assistance to help negate the crippling effects they’ve endured as a result. The relief bill will provide $32 billion in the form of grants to cover the wages and benefits of aviation employees.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how the $32 billion will be broken down within the aviation industry:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$25 billion for passenger airlines</li>\n<li>$4 billion for cargo airlines</li>\n<li>$3 billion for contractors (workers who handle ticketing, cleaning, catering, baggage, etc.)<em><sup>2</sup></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Passenger airlines and cargo airlines will also receive additional help, $25 billion and $4 billion respectively, via loans or loan guarantees.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p>In exchange for this assistance, the government has banned airlines receiving assistance from furloughing employees, making pay cuts, buying back stocks or issuing dividends to investors through September.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Local Government</strong></span></p>\n<p>State and local governments haven’t been immune to the financial hardships this global pandemic has caused. The stimulus package is offering $150 billion for state and local governments that have been working to combat the effects of COVID-19 in their communities.<em><sup>2</sup></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Food Assistance Programs</strong></span></p>\n<p>Anticipating a rise in demand for food banks as a result of the increasing unemployment rate, the bill has provided the Emergency Food Assistance Program with $450 million.

This is especially recommended if one feels sick or has a suspected or confirmed case of the virus. As directed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it’s important to self-quarantine and be mindful of personal hygiene, such as washing your hands and the like. Our health and the health of the nation is top of mind, but the question remains: will U.S. workers still get paid if they stay home?</p>\n<p>Roughly 25 percent of U.S. workers currently receive little to no paid sick leave, many of which are low-wage employees who depend on their paychecks.<sup><em>1</em> </sup>On March 18, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which intends to give paid leave to workers who did not have it and extend paid leave for workers who only received a few days. These benefits are only temporary, but they allow certain employees to receive paid leave if they need to take time off from work, due to the present virus.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding the Families First Coronavirus Response Act</strong><br />\nThe recently passed bill allows qualified employees two weeks of paid sick leave if they are sick, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventative care for COVID-19, or if they are caring for ill family members. Those who are caring for children whose schools are closed or whose childcare provider is unavailable due to the pandemic will be granted 12 weeks of paid leave.<sup><em>2</em></sup></p>\n<p>As long as you’ve been employed for at least 30 days, most employees of small and midsize companies, as well as nonprofit and government employees can receive paid leave. If you are a part-time worker, you will be paid the amount you earn in a two-week period.<sup><em>2</em> </sup>Alternatively, if you’re self-employed and pay taxes, you can also receive paid leave.</p>\n<p><strong>Who Is Excluded?</strong><br />\nEmployees working at companies with more than 500 people are excluded from these benefits. Those employed at companies with less than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department is able to exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business.<sup><em>3</em></sup> Employers can also decline to give leave to those facing the crisis head-on, including emergency responders and healthcare providers.</p>\n<p><strong>How Will My Business Be Affected?</strong><br />\nCompanies with more than 500 employees will need to pay the cost of paid sick and emergency leave, but they will be eligible for reimbursement tax credits at a later time.</p>\n<p>Businesses will be reimbursed up to $511 per employee, per day for paid sick leave wages paid to employees who must quarantine because they are sick with COVID-19 or are trying to receive a diagnosis. For those employees caring for family members, employers will be reimbursed up to $200 per worker, per day.<em><sup>3</sup></em> Self-employed individuals are also eligible to receive reimbursable tax credits.</p>\n<p>Those with fewer than 50 employees who are interested in applying for an exemption to the paid leave mandate because the viability of their business may be in jeopardy should reach out to the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p><strong>Are the Paid Leave Benefits Permanent?</strong><br />\nThe sick leave benefits included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act will only last through December 31, 2020.<sup><em>3</em></sup></p>\n<p><strong>When Does It Take Effect?</strong><br />\nThe recently passed bill was signed into law on March 18, 2020, and the paid leave provisions are expected to take effect within 15 days.<sup><em>2</em></sup> As we continue to see global increases in illnesses and deaths, the United States government is being urged to continue on the path of providing for America’s workforce.</p>\n<p>Guidelines will be issued for the Families First Coronavirus Response Act in order to assist employers in calculating how much paid leave their employees should receive. At that point, workers should be able to simply inform their employers of time off, take their leave and receive payment specified by the law.</p>\n<p><sub>1. https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/</sub><br />\n<sub>2. https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201/text</sub><br />\n<sub>3. https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-and-labor-announce-plan-to-implement-coronavirus-related-paid-leave-for-workers-and-tax-credits-for-small-and-midsize-businesses-to-swiftly-recover-the-cost-of-providing-coronavirus</sub></p>\n<p><em>This content may not be used for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties.

In order to prevent this, don’t ever give out personal information to anyone you don’t know over the phone.  The IRS never makes initial contact with taxpayers via an unsolicited phone call and never asks for personal information over the phone.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Phishing is another way that fraudsters use e-mails, text messages, websites and social media to bait taxpayers into providing their personal information or clicking a compromised link that can then be used to install malware onto a computer or other device.  These crooks often pose as a legitimate organization, such as a bank, credit card company or government organization like the IRS and might promise a big refund or personally threaten you. Don’t ever open attachments or click on links in suspicious e-mails. The IRS generally only contacts people by mail.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another form of tax fraud is identity theft.  This occurs when thieves typically steal a Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number to file a fraudulent return claiming a tax refund.  If a thief claims a refund in your name, you still will get a proper tax refund, but it will take time and a lot of paperwork.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is also important to do your research in order to avoid fraudulent accountants.  There are scammers who pose as tax professionals and rip off customers via refund fraud, identity theft and other schemes.  These criminals typically promise overly large tax refunds to prey on older Americans, low-income taxpayers and non-English speakers.  Make sure to Visit the <a title=\"https://www.bbb.org/\" href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Business Bureau’s website</a> to run a check. Look for disciplinary actions and the license status for credentialed preparers. For CPAs, check with your state’s Board of Accountancy. The IRS also <a title=\"https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/choosing-a-tax-professional\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/choosing-a-tax-professional\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has some tips</a> on how to choose a tax professional.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to avoid these types of scams, the best thing is to trust your gut.  If something seems to good to be true, it probably is. Never give out personal information via a phone call or e-mail and if you have questions about anything, ask for a detailed letter.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.499531396438613,"src":"/static/2558bee48b67d9785abed26a9e83cf39/26a4d/tax-scams-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2558bee48b67d9785abed26a9e83cf39/4e5cc/tax-scams-image.jpg 100w,\n/static/2558bee48b67d9785abed26a9e83cf39/5398f/tax-scams-image.jpg 200w,\n/static/2558bee48b67d9785abed26a9e83cf39/26a4d/tax-scams-image.jpg 400w,\n/static/2558bee48b67d9785abed26a9e83cf39/897d1/tax-scams-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/2558bee48b67d9785abed26a9e83cf39/57238/tax-scams-image.jpg 800w,\n/static/2558bee48b67d9785abed26a9e83cf39/526a4/tax-scams-image.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"70cf597c-09dc-5a79-8603-ed78864ad565","slug":"highlights-of-changes-for-2020-retirement-plan-contribution-limits","title":"Highlights of Changes for 2020 Retirement Plan Contribution Limits","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great news for savers!

Although “rollover” is a term widely used to mean moving money from one retirement account to another.  That money is best moved by direct transfer, but some employers will send a check. You have 60 days to roll that money over to an IRA or other qualified plan. If you miss that window, there is a grace period (with a penalty fee), but this is offered only once every 12 months. It’s best to do a direct transfer to avoid this becoming a problem.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Don’t assume an IRA is best.  </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of good reasons to move your money into an IRA (individual retirement account).  These accounts aren’t linked to any one employer and consolidate your money into a single retirement account.  However, your employer’s plan may offer you access to investment options, tools and institutional pricing that you might not get with an IRA.  In addition, the creditor protection for IRAs varies by state and might not be as secure as a 401(k) option.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Make sure to not overlook other tax strategies.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be other strategies to consider when weighing a job move, although most people associate 401(k) plans with pretax contribution. One option may be to convert the savings to a Roth IRA; you’ll owe income taxes on what you convert, but future growth and withdrawals will be tax free. If your income is lower that year, the tax impact will be less.  For those who’ve accumulated their employer’s stock in their 401(k) plans, leaving a job may open the door for an often overlooked tax break. Normally, distributions from a tax-deferred retirement account are taxed as ordinary income.

The Fed has cut rates twice this year to cushion the economy and experts are betting that there might be another cut as well when the Fed meets again in 2 weeks.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what can you do to make sure you are prepared for a recession if it were to happen?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you should pay off high-interest debts and boost your emergency savings. An emergency fund is key if an economic downturn leaves you strapped for cash or a potential loss of income.  Americans should also cut down on overall spending. You might want to consider having funds automatically put into a savings account from each paycheck.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As to be expected, those with higher incomes feel more secure about their financial position if a recession were to occur.  Those that are more comfortable financially have the ability to look ahead and tend to be more goal-oriented. Typically, those that can pay their bills without much concern also have the ability to be more mindful of their spending and can build their savings funds to better prepare in the event of a job loss or other emergency.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those living paycheck-to-paycheck, it is much more difficult to prepare for a downturn.  At a minimum, limiting any “wants” and putting aside even an extra $1 a day can be helpful is starting to build that emergency fund.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a strong financial mindset is the most important factor in trying to save for an economic downfall.  You should limit what you spend and control what you save. Being proactive about your money, instead of reactive, will put you in a better position to prepare for downside risk. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can&#8217;t tell you when the next recession will happen with any accuracy. Neither can the TV pundits or even the best economists. But we know that it will happen again. Real businesses will fail. Start with a plan based on your individual situation, prioritizing the following things:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building up emergency savings and paying off expensive debt</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximizing your professional value and prospects</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allocating your portfolio based on your goals and not on how the market is doing right now</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your priorities and the plan you make will be unique to you. But once you put it into action, it should help you minimize the harm from a recession, bounce back quickly, and even grow your wealth.

Financial stress not only leads to anxiety for many, but is also one of the key factors that can lead to conflicts in a relationship. Finding alignment on money matters should be a top priority in any serious relationship (and may help you sleep better at night as well!), but many struggle with finding ways to have these important conversations. Here are five money-related issues that anyone in a long-term relationship should avoid:</p>\n<p>1. Financial Infidelity &#8211; Dishonesty about money issues is a very common problem and is a key factor in ending a relationship. Whether lying about purchases or hiding massive credit card debt, holding back on financial information is lead to massive trust issues in any relationship. Partners should find a way to talk openly about their financial situation before it leads to problems in the future.</p>\n<p>2. Being too controlling or judgmental &#8211; Feeling like your significant other is stopping you from buying things you want can often lead to serious problems in a relationship. It is helpful to decide on an amount of money that each partner can spend with no questions asked and don&#8217;t judge the things your partner might want to purchase. Make this amount something that works within the budget of your relationship so it doesn&#8217;t lead to further issues down the line.</p>\n<p>3. Not talking about your finances regularly &#8211; Talking money might often lead to arguments, but it&#8217;s imperative not to avoid these conversations. These discussions should be about budgeting, setting joint financial goals and finding ways to agree on what to spend and save.</p>\n<p>4. Refusing to Compromise &#8211; Both partners in a relationship need to realize they might not always get their way when it comes to money. You should continue to discuss financial matters until you can come to an agreement on something that works for BOTH.</p>\n<p>5. Failing to Set Joint Financial Goals &#8211; It is extremely important for couples to set financial goals that they both agree on. If you are both in agreement on what your needs/wants are, then there is less likely to be an issue when it comes to deciding what to spend money on.</p>\n<p>The keys to successful relationships regarding financial issues are transparency, setting clear goals and compromise. Keeping the conversations flowing regarding money matters is integral to a healthy relationship. As relationships continue to change and evolve, it’s important to continue to have these discussions in an ongoing fashion. Keep experimenting with different methods until you find one that works best for you and your significant other and remember to always try to keep an open mind. These discussions might just be the key to a better night’s sleep AND a more successful and happier relationship.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.8,"src":"/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/26a4d/IMG_0006-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/4e5cc/IMG_0006-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/5398f/IMG_0006-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/26a4d/IMG_0006-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/897d1/IMG_0006-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/57238/IMG_0006-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/39a32/IMG_0006-1.jpg 1440w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"ff101b9b-6f66-58fa-becc-0263ab2d421c","slug":"cfp-delays-enforcement-of-their-new-fiduciary-standards","title":"CFP Delays Enforcement of Their New Fiduciary Standards","content":"<p><iframe title=\"Sherman Wealth | CFP Delays Their Fiduciary Standards\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYNTKWSX2oM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc. (CFP) states that their new fiduciary standards will be delayed, pushing the enforcement of these important ethics back to June 30, 2020. With this news comes questions about the quality of service people can expect from those handling their money, and what this all means to them in the long run.</p>\n<p>The CFP started reviewing their standards almost four years ago, in an effort to identify areas for improvement. Their code of ethics and standards of conduct, which were approved last year, require that all CFPs and brokers act in the best interests of their clients when providing financial advice. This is in contrast to the established set of standards that only required client advocacy with regards to their financial planning. With the current rule, if a CFP is not providing elements of financial planning, then they do not need to place their clients’ interests ahead of their own<strong>. </strong>It can come as a shock to many that those tasked with handling their money are not necessarily obligated to act in the best interest of investing it.</p>\n<p>When you start to appreciate the significance of these standards or lack thereof, you can see why the CFP&#8217;s decision to delay enforcement has many concerned. Currently, the CFP has 85,000 financial advisors certified under their current standards. When you factor in that many planners with a CFP designation have multiple clients with varying amounts of money under their management, you can start to see the magnitude of all this.</p>\n<p>To be a fiduciary means to act in the best interest of your clients. To uphold the integrity of such a title means that there cannot be any motivation of profiteering off clients in the interest of personal gain. A fiduciary is always to provide advice which is in the best interest of their clients.</p>\n<p>The world of finance can be a tricky landscape to negotiate. We use money every day, and it touches upon every aspect of our life, direct or indirect.</p>\n<p>That in mind, it&#8217;s important to consider regulations that may seem distant to us at face-value, but do in fact have a genuine impact on our wellbeing. Consider all this when you assess who handles your money. Huge firms that employ many advisors with the CFP designation were in fact the ones pushing for the delayment of the new fiduciary standards, stating that many of them needed more time to make the necessary business adjustments. The fact that they must alter their business strategies in order to incorporate stricter fiduciary standards proves that they have not consistently been acting in their clients best interest all along. An independent financial planner has the advantage of weighing all the options available to their clients, without being mandated to sell internal financial products. It’s characteristics like this that uphold the definition of a fiduciary, and help maintain the integrity associated with the term. Always be sure to take the time to consider these important characteristics, so that your financial wellbeing has as much integrity as those who are handling it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAgGBgcGBQgHBwcJCQgKDBQNDAsLDBkSEw8UHRofHh0aHBwgJC4nICIsIxwcKDcpLDAxNDQ0Hyc5PTgyPC4zNDL/2wBDAQkJCQwLDBgNDRgyIRwhMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjL/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFBP/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGjoY2KYwr/xAAcEAACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADBBESFCL/2gAIAQEAAQUC7dvJM0GAbVgJXqKfP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABwQAAIBBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQIQEjGRIv/aAAgBAQAGPwKMZPVDEzS4aXLf/8QAGxAAAwACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEREDFBUeH/2gAIAQEAAT8hSUjpwUIZ0SjTVx4njDpP/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCIL//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEf/aAAgBAwEBPxCtf//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARIf/aAAgBAgEBPxDVf//EAB0QAQACAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAERIQAxQWHBcaH/2gAIAQEAAT8QsFkSx3F7Kufmcs6sW4Y5PcQughO4bwCs72HzHpVJwXmMt/O8/9k=","aspectRatio":1.9047619047619047,"src":"/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/26a4d/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/4e5cc/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/5398f/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/26a4d/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/897d1/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/57238/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/23dde/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"ea710237-65ba-582a-9517-3a3075184c7e","slug":"how-to-plan-for-summer-activities-and-budget","title":"How to Plan For Summer Activities and Budget","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope everyone had a great Memorial Day Weekend filled with fun, sun and lots of good food and pool time.  We took our kids to Washington DC to pay respects and educate them on the brave men and women that lost their lives fighting for our freedom.  As parents, lots of the chatter we’ve heard this past Memorial Day weekend centered around our kids. Whether exhausted from all the spring sports (both physically and financially) or trying to figure out what to do with the kids this summer, many of us are all in the same boat.   For those of us that work full-time or part-time, it is necessary to find coverage for our kids during the summer without breaking the bank &#8211; certainly no easy feat! Most summer camps do offer before and after care, but it’s an at an additional cost after already paying the pricey sticker price of a week of camp. For those that have a parent that stays home with the kids, there is the question of “how much camp can we justify spending on” or “what activities can we do with our kids each week without spending a fortune?”  There are no right answers to these questions, but there are ways to help reduce the stress of the financial burden of summer break. First, making a family budget that includes setting aside money for whatever your summer plans are is a MUST, and don’t forget to include some vacation funds too. Another way to save is to browse sites like Living Social, Certifikid and Groupon for deals on summer camps and other activities. There are also many great free or inexpensive options through your local recreation departments &#8211; look into classes offered at nature centers, libraries and aquatic facilities. These things may not take the  financial stress out of summer, but with a little proactive planning, you might just be able to make the costs a little easier to swallow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another of the major kid/life stressors that was a topic of conversation this past weekend is the growing cost of keeping our kids involved in sports.  A new survey finds that 27% of &#8220;sports parents&#8221; are spending $500 or more each month on their children&#8217;s activities.  Even though most of us realize our kids aren’t likely going to be the next LeBron James or Tom Brady, we still want to give them every opportunity to succeed with any sport they might have interest in. Whether that means enrolling them in specialized pitching clinics or joining the club soccer team, the bottom line is that it means spending hundreds, if not thousands, each month in registration fees, uniforms and new equipment, not to mention the gas and wear &amp; tear on our cars getting them to practice, tournaments and team-bonding events throughout the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A recent survey finds that sports parents spend twice as much time on their children’s activities than they do on financial planning. To keep money priorities straight, it is recommended that parents commit to a plan.  According to Dara Luber, senior manager of retirement at TD Ameritrade, you should “start by identifying your financial goals and creating savings buckets for each of them — your retirement, your children&#8217;s education, vacations and sports, to name a few. Be sure to fund those priorities in order of importance, putting your retirement first, Luber said. Then, have regular budget meetings with your family, so that your children understand the trade-offs of participating in costly sports programs, such as forgoing a family vacation.” There is nothing wrong with helping your son or daughter realize their sports dreams, but it definitely shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of your own retirement or understate your family&#8217;s needs,&#8221; Luber said.

We’d also love to be able to send them to whatever camp they desire, for weeks on end, but that’s not always realistic either.   Before we spend more money than necessary on these types of things, we must be honest with ourselves with what our future goals are. Teaching our children the importance of saving over spending and wants vs. needs. will benefit everyone in the family. With some strategic planning, you might just be able to take the vacation of your dreams or send them to that special once in a lifetime camp that they’ve been begging for.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.75,"src":"/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/26a4d/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/4e5cc/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/5398f/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/26a4d/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/897d1/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/57238/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/8719f/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 1536w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"d15dce9a-2f81-5003-8a00-05c558e7b724","slug":"lack-of-financial-literacy-in-americas-schools","title":"LACK OF FINANCIAL LITERACY IN AMERICA’S SCHOOLS","content":"<p>“According to <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5233033/average-debt-every-age/\">Money</a>, the average millennial household &#8220;owes $14,800 in student loans.&#8221; Writer Kerri Anne Renzulli explains that while debt averages vary across each generation, people of all ages are demonstrating a greater comfort with debt.

As part of this program, I spoke to the students about managing debt, establishing credit, the benefit of low interest rates on your monthly payments, and the idea of “wants vs. needs.”   In today’s world, many adults still struggle with these concepts and even many Wharton students lack a basic financial education.(<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/even-mba-students-could-use-some-basic-money-lessons.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/even-mba-students-could-use-some-basic-money-lessons.html</a>).

Powell knocked that idea, by explaining that the central bank still sees the weakness as the result of “transitory” factors, such as portfolio management services, lower apparel prices and airfares.  The Fed’s target on inflation is 2%, and the core PCE rate watched by the Fed fell to a surprising 1.6% in the first quarter.&#8221;   President Donald Trump, who earlier this week urged the Fed to cut the rate by 1 percentage point was most likely frustrated with the Fed chair as well.</p>\n<p>Since the Fed did not indicate which direction the next move may be, this is a good time to review any variable interest rates you have (student loans, etc.).

As of 2019, 19 states require high school students to study financial literacy before earning a diploma, which is up from 17 in 2018 and 13 in 2011. It is great to see this progress year to year. At the business Pitch challenge, I listened to the students’ pitch which included a deep analysis of revenue, profit margin, and expenses of their business idea: a drone delivery service, which would deliver packages from door to door.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I encouraged the students to deepen their analysis by cutting costs through changing their business model from serving as a manufacturing company to serving as a software as a service business. This way, the company would be able to cut down on high fixed costs and focus on driving recurring revenue. The important thing to note is that the students were able to hold a discussion on cost-benefit analysis, while most high school students could not due to their limited understanding of financial metrics. Whether the Drone package delivery service would become a million -dollar company or not, these students have won the lottery by attending a school that would allow them to study finance before the rest of their peers across the country. The earlier students start to understand this material, the better. As they reach college and beyond, it is crucial that they become financially literate, which will make them financially smarter. It is crucial that young adults are able to make potentially complex decisions about student loans, mortgages, credit, and managing retirement-savings accounts. According to research studies, on average, students in states that require financial literacy courses in high school have lower credit card balances and pay for college using lower cost student loans than students living in states without this mandate. States with the mandate to incorporate financial literacy courses into the curriculum have seen an overall improvement in credit scores and a lower rate of late payments on credit cards among young adults. This shows how important it is for students to begin increasing their financial literacy as early as high school.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a financial advisory firm, Sherman Wealth is a big proponent of starting to increase financial literacy at an early age. We are excited that students in Montgomery county are working to increase their understanding of business strategy and financial information, which is what we think will help them long term. This is why I was excited to be a part of the business pitch competition and help coach the students into developing strategic ideas and better their business model</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4945652173913044,"src":"/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/d6959/unnamed-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/4e5cc/unnamed-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/5398f/unnamed-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/d6959/unnamed-1.jpg 275w","sizes":"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"02099344-0581-5a5b-b9fc-9e52e102d6cd","slug":"teachers-get-screwed-the-most","title":"Teachers Get Screwed The Most","content":"<p>It’s very unfortunate that school teachers, arguably one of the largest value-ads to communities across this nation, are getting taken to the woodshed on their retirement options. It’s 2019 and public school districts still haven’t found a way to properly help these individuals build a nest egg. We hear and see it all the time. In fact, we met with a 66-year old teacher yesterday from right here in <a href=\"https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/\">Montgomery Country</a>. As we wrapped up the introductory meeting, we already knew what would be uncovered as we began going over her statements.  Sure enough, we were correct. To be frank, seeing this stuff is really frustrating, especially to me, a son of a public school teacher, who learned all of this first hand.</p>\n<p>Most Americans who save for retirement at work have a basic 401(k) plan. These are offered at most companies and provide a decent selection of investment opportunities. The fees may be a little high, but these employees can build a properly diversified portfolio and it’s a win-win in the end for everyone involved. But there is a whole other sub-set of Americans who do <em>not</em> get to participate in a 401(k) plan. These include public school teachers, clergy members, employees of religious institutions or nonprofits, etc. These individuals are allowed to invest in what is known as a 403(b) plan. As a result, the people who do the most good in the world, spending their careers assisting others for below-average pay, often get screwed the most.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5165 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg 684w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1-300x125.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Value after 35 years, assuming $250 contributed monthly with an 8% average annual return.<a href=\"https://403bwise.com/healthcare/content/61\"> Source</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But it’s not their fault. They have to invest in <em>something</em>, right? And if this is their only option, what else are they to do? Most 403(b) accounts are peppered with complex, expensive products that usually cost their owners tens of thousands of dollars over their careers. How is this possible? One reason is that the 403(b) accounts that many workers contribute to are not held to the same rules and regulations as a 401(k). When these employees are told that these are approved products, they automatically assume the school district did some due diligence on it. Think again. We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the district you work in doesn’t pay any attention to these plans or products. To them, it’s just another hassle.</p>\n<p>Be wary of any adviser who takes commissions of any sort from investment or insurance companies. Ask whether any adviser your organization hires will be on call for one-on-one advice, too. We once talked to a teacher who said she literally called around to vendors in her state, looking for anything with a fee under 1.50%. What’s the worst part? No one could meet those (very simple) requirements. In fact, according to the <a href=\"https://retirementandinvestmentblog.aon.com/getattachment/36ff81a4-db35-4bc0-aac1-1685d2a64078/How_403\">analysis</a> prepared by Aon Hewitt, the average fees charged on variable and fixed annuities and mutual funds included in a 403(b) plan look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variable annuities: 2.25%.</li>\n<li>Fixed annuities: 1.15%.</li>\n<li>Mutual funds: 0.97%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By contrast, the average expense ratio of an ETF is just 0.44%. Unfortunately, ETFs <a href=\"https://www.plansponsor.com/blines-ask-the-experts-etfs-in-a-403b-plan/\">rarely appear</a> as an investment option in 403(b) plans.</p>\n<p>So, who’s fault is this? Ultimately, it falls on the individual school districts to properly vet the companies and salesman who are finding their ways into schools, like cockroaches in the night. We wrote a <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/are-managers-responsible-for-their-employees-retirement/\">piece</a> recently on why it’s an employer’s responsibility to ensure that their employees are being properly educated and informed on their retirement options. It is not the individuals responsibility to research the best choices. In all honesty, these individuals wouldn’t even know where to start in regards to due diligence between various products and funds.</p>\n<p>In the end, 403(b) plans in the modern world are outdated compared to their for-profit employer 401(k) plan peers by roughly 20 years. Most importantly, their existing multi-provider record keeper platforms, incredibly long investment menus, and inability to employ proper, institutionally-focused investment options have created an environment that impairs retirement outcomes for participants. It’s a sad reality for those who contribute to our society in such a respectable and positive way.</p>\n<p>If you are school teacher and are having trouble navigating your 403(b) plan and are unsure of where to turn for conflict free advice, please feel free to <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">reach out to us</a> and we&#8217;d be happy to assist you and any manner.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.6920415224913494,"src":"/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/26a4d/sad-teacher-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/4e5cc/sad-teacher-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/5398f/sad-teacher-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/26a4d/sad-teacher-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/897d1/sad-teacher-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/57238/sad-teacher-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/7f0bc/sad-teacher-1.jpg 978w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"b484bf50-d6dc-5fc2-9332-8779e22b8689","slug":"the-importance-of-financial-literacy","title":"The Importance of Financial Literacy","content":"<p>It was recently announced that the state of South Carolina was pushing to pass a bill that would require all high school students to take a course on financial literacy in order to graduate. Five states (Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia) are the only other states to have passed a similar law. As professionals who strive to preach the importance of this topic, we are very happy to see these developments. In fact, we think it’s particularly great that we, as a nation, are beginning to demand that children learn the basic of personal finance, <em>before</em> they step out into the real world.</p>\n<p>But first off, let’s tackle what the actual definition of “financial literacy” is. Financial literacy is the combination of financial, credit and debt management and the overall knowledge that is required to make responsible decisions regarding financial matters. Really, we are talking about the impact of finances on the daily issues an average family may encounter.</p>\n<p>Is the rate of financial literacy low in the US? Yep. (Actually, it’s low <a href=\"http://gflec.org/initiatives/sp-global-finlit-survey/\">around the world</a>.) Of course, the level of financial literacy varies according to education and income levels. However, there is a lot of evidence out there that shows that highly educated individuals with above-average incomes are almost equally as under-educated on these topics as those who may live a more modest lifestyle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5154\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1199\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg 1199w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-300x101.jpg 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-1024x344.jpg 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-768x258.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px\" /></a></p>\n<p>source: <a href=\"http://gflec.org/initiatives/sp-global-finlit-survey/\">S&amp;P GLOBAL FINLIT SURVEY</a></p>\n<p>Given this information, it is becoming increasingly more important to ensure that we are preparing our children with this knowledge well before they are starting college, creating families, and living an “adult” life. Why? Because it’s about the “long game”. Financial literacy is critical in helping people plan for retirement and avoiding high levels of debt. Last year, a <a href=\"https://www.tiaainstitute.org/sites/default/files/presentations/2017-02/economic_importance_of_financial_literacy.pdf\">study from TIAA-CREF</a> showed that those with high levels of financial literacy  are more likely to make astute decisions and typically, over their lifetime, amass twice as much wealth as those without a plan.</p>\n<p>If you can’t build a simple household budget, then you are likely financially illiterate. If you are oblivious to money-related decisions, are unsure of the consequences of these decisions, or you simply don’t care, then you’re financially illiterate. Most importantly, If you have learned the “hard way” over the years that not being up-to-date on financial matters has affected your life in a negative way, it is imperative that you do not allow your children to make the same mistakes. Important financial decisions are popping up earlier and earlier in life, as the world becomes more complex. You don’t “build” wealth and <em>then</em> figure out how to manage it properly. That ability to grow comes with managing it properly along the way.</p>\n<p>The statistics mentioned above are some of main reasons we have created the &#8220;Beers with Brad&#8221; seminar series. We feel that increasing your financial literacy is incredibly important to your long term financial goals and obligations.

And to be honest, he makes a pretty compelling point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As a man who has spent his career studying human behavior, Thaler draws the conclusion that humans are predictably irrational and consistently make choices which are not in their best interest. While this seems very simple on the outside, the findings are quite complex. Here’s a great example: only 50% of US workers participate in a workplace retirement plan. While some don’t have access to this type of benefit, many do have access, and simply don’t take advantage of it. Yet, we know that saving for retirement (and taking every advantage) is the optimal route to take.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Most of us would say we make wise decisions for ourselves and our families, but the data does not back up this sentiment. Thaler has also found that people only save money if it’s automatic. Thus, he feels to most important aspects of a 401(k) offering are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Automatic enrollment</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Automatic escalation</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Good default low-cost investment options</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Helping individuals roll their 401(k) into an IRA when they change jobs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Again, this seems like a very easy concept for CEOs and managers to adopt, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. Thaler proclaims, “If the employees at your firm are not saving enough for retirement, realize that it is your fault. And that is because we know how to make saving for retirement much easier and more successful.” But since so many workers <em>aren’t</em> saving, he places the blame on the managers themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But why should you care? Because the financial wellness of your employees will affect the bottom line of your business. <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/139373/business-case-wellbeing.aspx\">A report released by Gallup</a> on the Economics of Well-being tells us that having a low sense of financial stability can lead to “stress, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, and depression”. All of these emotions lead to reduced productivity and output. And worse? Employee retention also tends to spike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Step one: HR managers and senior executives should make 401(k) participation an “opt-out” decision. This creates a wall to prevent individuals from harming themselves by passing on automatic retirement savings. Second, escalating the amount of these contributions -over time &#8211; will allow your employees to increase their savings rate. Most studies have shown that <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://thefinancetwins.com/personal-savings-rate/\">your monthly savings rate is the number one statistic</a> that will decide whether you will be able to retire on time or not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Third, it is imperative that these retirement plans have low-cost investment options for employees to choose from. Simple index funds really will get the job done. In much of his work, Thaler points to the fact that humans are consistently irrational, so nudging them towards smart investment choices is important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The key to checking off these boxes is most likely automation. Managers and CEOs have the authority to make these decisions. In theory, the financial stability of your employees (and the ability for them to <em>feel </em>that stability) is largely dependent these types of executives. However, when said managers do indeed take these steps, it’s really a win-win situation for everyone involved.

After all, the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/02/26/raising-child-costs-233-610-you-financially-prepared-parent/357243002/\">average cost of raising a child today</a> in middle-class America is nearly $250,000, excluding college tuition expenses. These types of numbers leave many couples in “catch up” mode when it comes to their savings and retirement planning.</p>\n<p>The first step, as we all know, is creating a plan. You can’t make any headway towards debt and savings goals without a clear, executable strategy. Three big keys are: concentrate on building up your investments, boost your credit, and reevaluate your real estate needs. This is a major inflection point in your life, and thus an ideal time to consider all these topics.</p>\n<p>Regarding your savings, your cash flow is (hopefully) growing, or at least turning positive. Because you have a limited amount of time to get things in order, taking action in the areas mentioned above should be done as soon as possible, especially if any emergency funds have been drained. More parents tend to undersave and overspend while their children are still living under their roof. Here are some questions to ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do we have enough cash to make it through the next economic contraction or bear market?</li>\n<li>Is our credit card debt manageable?</li>\n<li>Are the balances in our 401(k) and IRA accounts where they need to be?</li>\n<li>Is our house “too much” for us without the children?</li>\n<li>Do they kids still need insurance?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that some of your larger expenses have come and gone, there must be a mental shift from “paying the bills” to “creating a better future”. You will need to monitor your assets more closely now, and extra money should be going more towards retirement accounts and less towards material things. There is good news for those who may be a little behind, as <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19000-for-2019-ira-limit-increases-to-6000\">the IRS has increased contribution limits in 2019</a> for 401(k) and IRA accounts.</p>\n<p>However, one key to keeping your nest empty is taking the time to educate your children on the importance of personal finance. This is a very important step in creating and maintaining a “moat” around your new-found savings. The more educated your children are on the basics of day-to-day money management, the less likely they are to need your assistance in the immediate future. These are great opportunities to preach to them about not living beyond their means, sticking to a budget, saving a little each month, and the consequences of debt.</p>\n<p>There are a few important things than can be tackled that will allow you to get off on the right foot towards rebuilding your retirement savings. The key is to capitalize on the new-found opportunities to do so. And one of those, in this moment, is a focus on your future, not your child’s future. Of course you should give them the tools to financially fend for themselves, but going forward the main goal is retirement for you and your spouse.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5325670498084292,"src":"/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/26a4d/empty-nest-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/4e5cc/empty-nest-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/5398f/empty-nest-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/26a4d/empty-nest-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/897d1/empty-nest-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/57238/empty-nest-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/526a4/empty-nest-1.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c9e14ebb-3ba0-54aa-b18d-faa5a19a25e1","slug":"tips-for-furloughed-workers-during-the-shutdown","title":"Tips for furloughed workers during the shutdown","content":"<p>Before we get started, lets recognize that this isn’t the first time there’s been a shutdown, and it probably won’t be the last. But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that so many workers are now reaching their third week of no pay. There are roughly 800,000 federal employees who are not receiving paychecks right now, many of whom are located right here in the DC Metro area. While some are technically on a &#8220;leave of absence&#8221;, many are being expected to work for no pay. What&#8217;s worse is that federal employees already make, on average, quite a bit less than their private sector peers. On top of this, while most workers are expecting to be paid retroactively once the shutdown is over, it’s not mandatory.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, take a look at your monthly budget and find items you can easily remove.</p>\n<p>Another helpful tip is to contact your bank. In fact, one institution headquartered here in the DC Metro, Navy Federal Credit Union,  is extending a zero-interest loan up to $6,000 with no fees and a grace period. Many banks are willing to make exceptions. Bank of America and Wells Fargo also have outreach programs that assist federal employees. Most institutions have similar processes in place for their employees that allow them to contact creditors and landlords in order to ask for assistance.</p>\n<p>Another step that federal employees can take is to proactively reach out to creditors. Best move? Develop a simple letter that explains your situation: &#8220;I am a government employee who has lost income due to the government shutdown. Due to these events, my income has been drastically reduced for the time being and I am unable to make my payment in full this month.&#8221; On top this, don&#8217;t forget to include account numbers and contact information with the letter.</p>\n<p>While filing for unemployment may seem like the best &#8220;quick fix&#8221;, that isn&#8217;t necessarily true. A large portion of these federal employees can apply for unemployment while on temporary leave of absence. Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t cover everyone. For those who are expected to report to work without pay (as mentioned above), do not qualify for these benefits. In most states (and D.C.), if you collect unemployment benefits, and then receive retroactive your pay, you will indeed be require to repay the government.</p>\n<p>If you are a government worker who participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, you may take loans from their retirement savings if the furlough is expected to last 30 days or less. You may not take the loan if your leave goes beyond that period. However, remember than once you remove money from your retirement account, that money is no long invested in the market. You will also be required to repay the money, so this should be used as a last resort.</p>\n<p>One last note to keep in mind: Be skeptical about picking up work while you are on furlough. Even though the government is shut down, you are still an employee of the federal government. Because of this, certain employment (outside the scope of your federal job)may be restricted.</p>\n<p>While these tips may bring short-term relief, the best course of action is to develop a long-term plan for these types of situations. This will be the first time that a government shutdown has extended past two pay periods, making the financial situation for many households that much tighter. No one knows how long the current shutdown will last, or when the next will arise, and that is exactly the reason to be prepared for these types of scenarios.</p>\n<p>If you are federal employee who has questions about your day-to-day income during the shutdown, and are wanting to talk to a professional, please f<a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">eel free to reach out</a> to us.

Which reminded me that now is a great time to revisit your W-4. Why? Because t’s very, very likely that the W-4 form on file with your employer is off. Last year, the Treasury Department and the IRS released <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/2019-tax-brackets/\">updated withholding tables </a>(below) to reflect the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation resulted in lower individual income tax rates, a doubled standard deduction and the elimination of personal exemptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5057\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg 649w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1-300x111.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As we know, taxes can be somewhat finicky: if not enough is withheld, you’ll owe money come tax time. Pay too much, and you end up with a large refund. On top that, while earning a bigger paycheck twice a month sounds awesome, it could come back to hurt you come April. With all this being said, we obviously want to be as close to zero as possible. But how do we accomplish this in a changing tax environment?</p>\n<p>Prior to 2019, it was common to withhold less from your pay if you had deductions that were itemized. However, that may no longer hold true considering the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/taxes/2019/01/08/5-popular-tax-deductions-that-took-big-hits-from-t.aspx\">standard deduction is nearly twice</a> what it previously was. Due of these new tax laws, a high percentage of households who itemized in previous years will no longer be able to do so (another reason to check up your withholding). Previous laws also allowed income earners to withhold less in taxes if you they had dependents. Going forward, these types of exemptions are gone, so those filers should review their pay stub to ensure that they’re not under-withheld.</p>\n<p>Another reason to make sure your refund isn&#8217;t &#8220;too big&#8221; is because you will, more or less, be giving the government an interest-free loan. With cash accounts now paying above 2%, that money is better off working for you in your own account. This would allow you to pay off debt, add to your savings, or a multitude of things that are better than simply giving it to the US government for a year, which <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\">we have covered before</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are retired, one option is to use your Form W-4V to withhold a flat rate from your Social Security earnings. Further, use your Form W-4P to withhold from your pension. Additionally, there are <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tax-deductions-that-are-going-away-4582165\">new limits on deductions for state and local taxes and home mortgage interest</a>, a big item for many in the DC Metro and other locales.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re feeling confused about the upcoming tax season (which is almost upon us), please <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">feel free to reach out</a> to us.

However, following a reassuring tone from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, large indices will actually finish the week in positive territory.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, President Trump seemingly doubled down on his willingness to let the government shutdown continue.

It was the strongest performance in six years. The National Retail Federation had projected that consumers, on average, planned to spend $1,007 for decorations, candy, gifts, and other purchases for themselves. It was also a great year for online retail, with sales jumping 19.1% over 2017 according to the same study. Apparel sales were up 7.9% year over year as well, showing the best growth since 2010.</p>\n<p>Are you aware of what you’re paying in fees? Is your portfolio truly in line with your risk profile?

Year after year we see the same types of studies and the alarming statistics they produce in regards to savings and retirement planning (or lack thereof). </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-big-reason-americans-are-so-stressed-and-unhealthy-2018-10-11?link=sfmw_tw\">Almost half of Americans</a></span><span class=\"s1\"> (44% to be exact) list money as the largest contributor to stress in their lives. To make matters worse, the stress isn’t confined to the household. A <a href=\"http://jhrps.com/Wellness\"><span class=\"s2\">recent John Hancock study</span></a> found that 72% of us take our money worries into the workplace with us, clearly affecting more of our daily lives than we would like. That same study claims that this stress causes physical and psychological problems (anxiety, sleeplessness, etc.) for nearly 60% of us. Many will say that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/why-dont-americans-save-money/478929/\"><span class=\"s2\">American’s simply cannot afford to save money</span></a> anymore. Medical expenses are high. Housing is expensive. Short-term burdens make it hard to plan for long-term goals. Many work at a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Rising number of single-parent households. The list is endless. And trust me, I get it. I totally understand these hurdles can be intimidating.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But at the end of the day, these are all just excuses. Just like they were excuses last year and the year before that. We constantly spend our time fretting over these topics, but ironically never put a plan together to actually get ahead. It’s the same scenario as the person who feels they are overweight, goes to the gym for two weeks each January, and then eventually gives up on their weight loss plan. You need a plan. And better yet, you need someone that is going to hold you accountable to that plan. Without a well-established roadmap, how are you going to reach your final destination? No one ever accomplished anything without executing a plan! And it’s not just about a retirement plan. Having a plan for weekly and monthly expenses will build the mental consistency that is required for longer term goals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don’t let 2019 be another year of day-to-day stress, secretly praying that no unexpected expenses pop up between now and your next paycheck. It’s a vicious cycle that is hard to remove yourself from unless you come up with a concrete plan of action and stick with it. Making more money is not the key to living a financially stress-free life. It can help, sure. But with out a plan you will eventually fall back into the same, undisciplined routine. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are having trouble developing a plan or are unsure where to start, <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\">please feel free to reach out to us</a>.

Coming into the month of December, we were told how, historically, this is a bullish time of year for equities. Unfortunately, “historically” is just another term for “average” and while December may typically be a strong month, that was not the case this year. It’s usually a positive month, rarely negative. But it looks like 2018 will not see a normal December, which would make sense considering how the full year has played out in general.<a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4775\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png 624w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1-300x177.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trade tariffs continue to garner the most attention in headlines. The market tends to have large, upward swings on positive news regarding the US-China debacle, but they are short-lived, as many feel these positive updates simply fall into the “boy who cried wolf” category at this point. We may not see a sustained move in either direction (up or down) until some kind of formal agreement has been reached between the two parties.</p>\n<p>To add to the worries, signs from abroad have not been much better. British Prime Minister Theresa May has fallen on tough times in regards to her Brexit battle, now fighting for her own political life. This week, a right-wing faction in her own party triggered a “no confidence” vote following May’s decision to postpone the debate over a deal that could have finally brought closure to the issue as a whole, which initially arose over two years ago. In China, weak economic data shows that the trade tensions are severely affecting their economy, with weaker than expected industrial output and retail sales numbers. On top of this, the reports out of Europe weren’t any better. In fact, the German and French private sectors (arguably the two most important in the Eurozone) are trending downwards in terms of growth. Further, Italian debt issues keep the country on the brink of recession. Despite the headline worries and weak economic showings in foreign economies, the US data continue to produce strong numbers, although some areas are starting to slow. Retail sales remain high, while manufacturing and service sectors output fell to new lows. We are still in an expansion, albeit at a slower than what we have been accustomed to over the past few years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Where is Bitcoin?</p>\n<p>Last year’s favorite asset, Bitcoin, is now down over 70% on the year, back to the $3300 area we saw last July 2017.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4776\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"845\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png 845w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1-300x176.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1-768x451.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If your goals for your assets have changed, if you believe your risk tolerance may not be in line with the drawdown you’ve seen in your portfolio recently, or if you just want to talk about your individual situation this is a great opportunity to <a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">let us know</a>.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAIAAAA7N+mxAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAABdUlEQVQoz5WRXU/CMBiF+av+DPDKOyeRKF9TiChR0CtjJMbonSF6Y4KigKDAUMRtHfti69ZtbPPdEBMSE/WsWdfuPe152oj5BxGTuPBAv6jIz9WE6NjQdQwN64aiKe8TBhv4d7NhGJKsTh3b91zXnfqeRxwcay/diTe+5WMTL5ihWtd1eGOMbYuMOLS8sbeSKW0dna3vHqcOTssnV0hjucmIGBbsb4QKzNA5juPB8oTAhyzLzOC10xvUGk+1xxa02/tG67kbZLCnlmXZtk1CBWYYvA2H9Ye6oioIoV6viwThpdNm+sxYEJh+X5El9mPUbDZ4BH8EjuNUVVUUJTD7vn95cR6NxnYKhWRyMx5fKxb38/k8RVG53HYikUil05VKJU6t0jRdKh/S2SydzVSr15AlZMZY0zSWZYVAY4Zh4LhFUeQ4XpIkmId9dE0TEAIoSMfzCM4IkkfmN2lCfgACKiCHBWd4wXAOOaMNq+wv5u/r+Zdmrk8BQx9Jldam8wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","aspectRatio":2.0080213903743314,"src":"/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/cad89/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png","srcSet":"/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/1d716/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 100w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/f0031/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 200w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/cad89/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 400w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/d4196/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 600w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/cd90a/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 751w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"4b2a7753-fcc2-54d8-b3d3-a710fdcbd155","slug":"weekly-market-review-12-07-2018","title":"Weekly Market Review 12/07/2018","content":"<p>We experienced more of the choppy environment in equities this past week.

First off, crude oil prices have fallen from $76 to $50 per barrel recently, which should cause some relief at the pump for consumers. In fact, national gasoline <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/12/07/gas-prices-reach-new-2018-low/\">prices fell to $2.46/gallon</a>, a new low for 2018. A main cause of the lower prices has been the massive over-production here in the US. On the other hand, natural gas prices have seen a large spike over the last few weeks, in large part due to the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/natural-gas-prices-have-surged-over-the-last-month-heres-why.html\">lowest stockpiles of gas</a> in nearly a decade. So, while you may be saving money when you fill up your car for a long road trip over the holidays, you may see a higher natural gas than usual as we go further into the winter months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4769\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"843\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png 843w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1-300x177.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1-768x452.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you are feeling a little antsy over the recent market volatility, I would like to bring your attention to the chart below. The average intra-year drop on the S&amp;P 500 is roughly 14%. So far this year we have experienced two declines, one of 12.8% (January &#8211; February) and one around 11.3% (October). Both are below the average. These types of swings are experienced on an annual basis. Due to the fact that 2017 was such a low volatility year (as mentioned above), recency bias has kicked in and has many believing that the 2018 environment is seeing above-average fluctuations. It is not. However, if your goals for your assets have changed, or if you believe your risk tolerance may not be in line with the drawdown you’ve seen in your portfolio recently, this is a great opportunity to <a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">let us know</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-5-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4770\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-5-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"765\" height=\"572\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-5-1.png 765w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-5-1-300x224.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px\" /></a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.0080213903743314,"src":"/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/cad89/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png","srcSet":"/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/1d716/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 100w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/f0031/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 200w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/cad89/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 400w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/d4196/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 600w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/cd90a/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 751w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"4cb15e4c-2474-5731-bf35-df070f38fc2b","slug":"is-your-mutual-fund-tax-efficient","title":"Is Your Mutual Fund Tax Efficient?","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well, it’s that time of year again. That time when mutual fund companies report distributions for capital gains taxes. Just in time for the holidays and a total buzzkill on all of that discretionary spending you planned on participating in.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“But I’m in a Buy &amp; Hold portfolio and didn’t sell. How can I have a taxable gain?” Ah, this is where one of the (many) hidden flaws of investing in mutual funds comes into the picture. It’s not about what you, the investor and shareholder, buy and sell. It’s about what happens behind the curtains of the fund you’re invested in. Probably not something your advisor has taken the time to explain to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A capital gains distribution is a payment to shareholders that is prompted by a fund manager&#8217;s liquidation of underlying stocks and securities in a mutual fund or derived from dividend and interest earned by the fund&#8217;s holdings minus the fund&#8217;s operating expenses. Further, </span><span class=\"s2\">these distributions must be made</span><span class=\"s1\"> because tax law dictates that substantial portion of investment income and capital gains must be paid to investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“But my return on the fund is essentially flat (or negative) for the year. Why is the distribution so high?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Again, this is one of the most frustrating things about mutual funds and why they are, for the most part, terribly inefficient from a tax perspective. Regardless of how long the investor owned the fund, the distributions are taxed based on how long the fund itself held the sold holdings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Can you imagine owning a fund that returned 1-2% in 2018 and being told you are going to get hit with a 10% (or even larger in some circumstances) taxable event? It’s not even your choice. Was your “buy and hold” game plan specifically built to be tax-conscious? Well, maybe in theory it was. But reality is different. Even many Vanguard mutual funds are paying massive distributions in 2018. This is a big deal for investors with assets in accounts that aren’t a 401(k) or IRA.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In an <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/890938/more-tax-pain-for-some-mutual-fund-shareholders-in.html\">excellent piece</a> by Christine Benz earlier this month, she points to the fact that “many mutual funds are likely to dish out capital gains distributions that are on par with&#8211;or even higher than&#8211;years past adds insult to injury.” Mutual funds that need to raise cash can sell profitable investments and create capital gains for investors, even if the fund has performed poorly. This means you can lose money on an investment in a mutual fund but still end up owing taxes. As I mentioned above, capital gains in a mutual fund get passed along to its investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> An <a href=\"https://www.etftrends.com/etf-strategist-channel/etfs-tax-time/\"><span class=\"s2\">interesting article</span></a> put out by ETF Trends states that ETFs have tax efficiency built into the structure. The “exchange traded” attribute of the ETF structure allows investors to purchase and sell shares without creating or redeeming small odd-lots. This is very different from mutual funds where every day mismatched buyers and sellers force transactions and tax implication in the underlying fund. The tax implications from these transactions become liabilities to those still holding the mutual fund shares. Furthermore, the creation and redemption process, which allows for in-kind transaction with Authorized Participants (APs) can further reduce the likelihood of creating a distributable capital gain in the ETF structure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With all this said, I again point to the fact that ETFs, particularly from a taxable income standpoint, are much more optimal for investors over the long term. There are plenty of other arguments (closet indexing, high(er) fees, diversification, etc.) of why we continue to promote the use of ETFs over mutual funds, but tax consequences are by far one of the top reasons we advise clients to steer clear. Forget Sharpe Ratios and standard deviation statistics, if you want to talk about risk…it’s simply not worth the risk of getting hit by a major taxable event. Remove those possibilities from your game plan and look to ETFs as the proper vehicle to reach the goals you’ve set for your portfolio.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you would like to have your portfolio analyzed for fees and tax efficiency schedule a time to chat with us <a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">here </a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.917808219178082,"src":"/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/26a4d/taxhazard-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/4e5cc/taxhazard-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/5398f/taxhazard-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/26a4d/taxhazard-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/cf658/taxhazard-1.jpg 560w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"941fd830-b048-5e68-b2cb-f75e2756f013","slug":"the-2019-contribution-limits-are-here","title":"The 2019 Contribution Limits Are Here!","content":"<p>Great news for savers!

Talking about and managing finances together","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money woes are the leading cause of divorce in American couples. Over ⅓ of people in the United States have stated that financial pressure was the biggest challenge their marriage has faced in the past, and ¼ of Americans have said most of their arguments are money-related. As a financial planner, I work with a lot of couples &#8211; and I’m always surprised by how few of them have actually had an honest conversation about their money. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old saying holds true when it comes to household finances &#8211; communication is key. When you work toward creating a financial plan with your spouse, you need to talk to each other about expectations, frustrations, and any goals or dreams you may have. That being said, money conversations can also be incredibly uncomfortable &#8211; which is probably why so many American couples avoid them altogether. Knowing what you’re walking into, and how to best talk about money with your spouse ahead of time, can help you have a productive conversation. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know Yourself and Know Your Spouse</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to point fingers when it comes to money because it’s frustrating to admit our own faults. We may be harboring some guilt around unhealthy spending habits, or be embarrassed because we don’t know as much as we think we should about saving for retirement. On the other hand, our money mindset may be a direct result of how we were raised &#8211; and it may be different from how our spouse approaches their finances. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding where you fall down when it comes to your personal finances is key in order to talk to your spouse about building a financial plan that’s going to work for your family. When you know your own flaws, you’re able to create a plan of action that helps you to stay on track &#8211; which is something your spouse will appreciate. It’s also important to understand your spouse’s money mindset, as well as their financial strengths and weaknesses. Having a clear understanding of how each of you approach financial decisions, or value your money will help you to align your vision for the future (and avoid arguments down the road).</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approach Financial Opinions With No Judgement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal finance is always emotionally charged. Everyone has opinions on how money should be handled, and often they differ dramatically &#8211; even between an otherwise compatible couple. Money conversations between two spouses who have different opinions </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">money can evolve into arguments quickly. The key is to approach all financial opinions your spouse may hold without judgement. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, this sounds easy &#8211; it’s not. For example, if you firmly believe in paying down debt and living a debt free lifestyle, but your spouse sees the benefit in carrying some debt and would prefer to prioritize saving before debt repayment &#8211; you may find yourself falling into the trap of judging them for their opinion because you strongly believe that yours is “right.” The truth is, when it comes to money, there are no “right” opinions. Opinions are just that &#8211; opinions. They’re based on a value set and history that someone has with their personal finances. They aren’t fact, and they aren’t “wrong.” Knowing that your spouse’s financial opinions aren’t right or wrong (and neither are yours) can help you move through conversations without assigning emotional value to their ideas.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also important to avoid judgement of each other’s financial past. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/27/1-in-8-divorces-are-caused-by-student-loans.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 in 8 divorces</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are directly caused by student loan debt. The pressure that hefty debt, a lack of savings, or other financial missteps you bring to the table can potentially alienate your spouse. Working together to be on the same “team” when it comes to addressing these money woes is key.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set Goals Together</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you’re discussing your family’s finances, you’re going to come to a point where you need to set goals that you’re working toward. It’s tempting to set individual goals and work independently toward them, but that’s a recipe for financial dissonance in your household. Talking through your money goals, and working to align them with the values you share as a couple, can help you lay a foundation of financial peace in your home. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you set financial goals together as a married couple, you’re actively working to approach your money situation as a team. You’re building a safety net that protects both of you, planning for the lifestyle you want as a unit, and staying honest with one another. Once you’ve set goals as a team, you can move forward with creating a game plan that puts you on the path to reach those goals. This might mean creating a household budget, setting up automatic payments to knock out your debt or build up your savings, or building in “rewards” like a date night once you hit smaller milestones on your way to your long-term goals. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re struggling to find common ground when it comes to your  money, </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talking to a fiduciary, fee-only financial advisor can help</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
