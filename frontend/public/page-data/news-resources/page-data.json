You should revisit your W-4 whenever you have a major personal life change. As we have written in the past, the potential for both a tax bill and a tax refund should be zero, or close to it. However, if you count on a big tax refund every year, pay attention to your withholding because it directly impacts your refund.  You can adjust your W-4 at any time throughout the year, but if you do it later in the year, there will be less impact on your taxes for that year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need any assistance with your taxes or updating your W-4, you should speak to a professional.  We are happy to provide you with CPA recommendations if you would like.

You have 60 days to roll that money over to an IRA or other qualified plan. If you miss that window, there is a grace period (with a penalty fee), but this is offered only once every 12 months. It’s best to do a direct transfer to avoid this becoming a problem.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Don’t assume an IRA is best.  </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of good reasons to move your money into an IRA (individual retirement account).  These accounts aren’t linked to any one employer and consolidate your money into a single retirement account.  However, your employer’s plan may offer you access to investment options, tools and institutional pricing that you might not get with an IRA.  In addition, the creditor protection for IRAs varies by state and might not be as secure as a 401(k) option.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Make sure to not overlook other tax strategies.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be other strategies to consider when weighing a job move, although most people associate 401(k) plans with pretax contribution. One option may be to convert the savings to a Roth IRA; you’ll owe income taxes on what you convert, but future growth and withdrawals will be tax free. If your income is lower that year, the tax impact will be less.  For those who’ve accumulated their employer’s stock in their 401(k) plans, leaving a job may open the door for an often overlooked tax break. Normally, distributions from a tax-deferred retirement account are taxed as ordinary income. Under the so-called “net unrealized appreciation” break, you can opt to withdraw your employer’s stock as shares. You’ll owe ordinary income tax on the cost basis, but not on any gains. When you sell the shares down the road, you’ll owe capital-gains tax just on the shares’ appreciation.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we enter the 4th quarter, and you may have received all your September 30th statements from all your old 401k plans, use this opportunity as  a good time to evaluate and understand what you have and you options. Keeping regular tabs on what is going on with your investments is critical to ensuring they line up with your goals for the future.  </span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.5698924731182795,"src":"/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/26a4d/401k-1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/4e5cc/401k-1-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/5398f/401k-1-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/26a4d/401k-1-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/897d1/401k-1-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/57238/401k-1-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/937817f9d1cd2c99dca1ad54ed6a0c79/3893c/401k-1-1.jpg 1195w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"7358a901-13d2-5fd1-b918-49dfae6ccc50","slug":"are-you-ready-for-a-recession-a-survey-says-probably-not","title":"Are you ready for a recession?

The Fed has cut rates twice this year to cushion the economy and experts are betting that there might be another cut as well when the Fed meets again in 2 weeks.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what can you do to make sure you are prepared for a recession if it were to happen?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you should pay off high-interest debts and boost your emergency savings. An emergency fund is key if an economic downturn leaves you strapped for cash or a potential loss of income.  Americans should also cut down on overall spending. You might want to consider having funds automatically put into a savings account from each paycheck.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As to be expected, those with higher incomes feel more secure about their financial position if a recession were to occur.  Those that are more comfortable financially have the ability to look ahead and tend to be more goal-oriented. Typically, those that can pay their bills without much concern also have the ability to be more mindful of their spending and can build their savings funds to better prepare in the event of a job loss or other emergency.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those living paycheck-to-paycheck, it is much more difficult to prepare for a downturn.  At a minimum, limiting any “wants” and putting aside even an extra $1 a day can be helpful is starting to build that emergency fund.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a strong financial mindset is the most important factor in trying to save for an economic downfall.  You should limit what you spend and control what you save. Being proactive about your money, instead of reactive, will put you in a better position to prepare for downside risk. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can&#8217;t tell you when the next recession will happen with any accuracy. Neither can the TV pundits or even the best economists. But we know that it will happen again. Real businesses will fail. Start with a plan based on your individual situation, prioritizing the following things:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building up emergency savings and paying off expensive debt</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximizing your professional value and prospects</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allocating your portfolio based on your goals and not on how the market is doing right now</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your priorities and the plan you make will be unique to you. But once you put it into action, it should help you minimize the harm from a recession, bounce back quickly, and even grow your wealth.

Financial stress not only leads to anxiety for many, but is also one of the key factors that can lead to conflicts in a relationship. Finding alignment on money matters should be a top priority in any serious relationship (and may help you sleep better at night as well!), but many struggle with finding ways to have these important conversations. Here are five money-related issues that anyone in a long-term relationship should avoid:</p>\n<p>1. Financial Infidelity &#8211; Dishonesty about money issues is a very common problem and is a key factor in ending a relationship. Whether lying about purchases or hiding massive credit card debt, holding back on financial information is lead to massive trust issues in any relationship. Partners should find a way to talk openly about their financial situation before it leads to problems in the future.</p>\n<p>2. Being too controlling or judgmental &#8211; Feeling like your significant other is stopping you from buying things you want can often lead to serious problems in a relationship. It is helpful to decide on an amount of money that each partner can spend with no questions asked and don&#8217;t judge the things your partner might want to purchase. Make this amount something that works within the budget of your relationship so it doesn&#8217;t lead to further issues down the line.</p>\n<p>3. Not talking about your finances regularly &#8211; Talking money might often lead to arguments, but it&#8217;s imperative not to avoid these conversations. These discussions should be about budgeting, setting joint financial goals and finding ways to agree on what to spend and save.</p>\n<p>4. Refusing to Compromise &#8211; Both partners in a relationship need to realize they might not always get their way when it comes to money. You should continue to discuss financial matters until you can come to an agreement on something that works for BOTH.</p>\n<p>5. Failing to Set Joint Financial Goals &#8211; It is extremely important for couples to set financial goals that they both agree on. If you are both in agreement on what your needs/wants are, then there is less likely to be an issue when it comes to deciding what to spend money on.</p>\n<p>The keys to successful relationships regarding financial issues are transparency, setting clear goals and compromise. Keeping the conversations flowing regarding money matters is integral to a healthy relationship. As relationships continue to change and evolve, it’s important to continue to have these discussions in an ongoing fashion. Keep experimenting with different methods until you find one that works best for you and your significant other and remember to always try to keep an open mind. These discussions might just be the key to a better night’s sleep AND a more successful and happier relationship.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.8,"src":"/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/26a4d/IMG_0006-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/4e5cc/IMG_0006-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/5398f/IMG_0006-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/26a4d/IMG_0006-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/897d1/IMG_0006-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/57238/IMG_0006-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/c30fc1c3818928468546e4ffcb7eb7eb/39a32/IMG_0006-1.jpg 1440w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"d595df30-4d40-56c3-a8cc-8e291e73f2fb","slug":"cfp-delays-enforcement-of-their-new-fiduciary-standards","title":"CFP Delays Enforcement of Their New Fiduciary Standards","content":"<p><iframe title=\"Sherman Wealth | CFP Delays Their Fiduciary Standards\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYNTKWSX2oM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc. (CFP) states that their new fiduciary standards will be delayed, pushing the enforcement of these important ethics back to June 30, 2020. With this news comes questions about the quality of service people can expect from those handling their money, and what this all means to them in the long run.</p>\n<p>The CFP started reviewing their standards almost four years ago, in an effort to identify areas for improvement. Their code of ethics and standards of conduct, which were approved last year, require that all CFPs and brokers act in the best interests of their clients when providing financial advice. This is in contrast to the established set of standards that only required client advocacy with regards to their financial planning. With the current rule, if a CFP is not providing elements of financial planning, then they do not need to place their clients’ interests ahead of their own<strong>. </strong>It can come as a shock to many that those tasked with handling their money are not necessarily obligated to act in the best interest of investing it.</p>\n<p>When you start to appreciate the significance of these standards or lack thereof, you can see why the CFP&#8217;s decision to delay enforcement has many concerned. Currently, the CFP has 85,000 financial advisors certified under their current standards. When you factor in that many planners with a CFP designation have multiple clients with varying amounts of money under their management, you can start to see the magnitude of all this.</p>\n<p>To be a fiduciary means to act in the best interest of your clients. To uphold the integrity of such a title means that there cannot be any motivation of profiteering off clients in the interest of personal gain. A fiduciary is always to provide advice which is in the best interest of their clients.</p>\n<p>The world of finance can be a tricky landscape to negotiate. We use money every day, and it touches upon every aspect of our life, direct or indirect.</p>\n<p>That in mind, it&#8217;s important to consider regulations that may seem distant to us at face-value, but do in fact have a genuine impact on our wellbeing. Consider all this when you assess who handles your money. Huge firms that employ many advisors with the CFP designation were in fact the ones pushing for the delayment of the new fiduciary standards, stating that many of them needed more time to make the necessary business adjustments. The fact that they must alter their business strategies in order to incorporate stricter fiduciary standards proves that they have not consistently been acting in their clients best interest all along. An independent financial planner has the advantage of weighing all the options available to their clients, without being mandated to sell internal financial products. It’s characteristics like this that uphold the definition of a fiduciary, and help maintain the integrity associated with the term. Always be sure to take the time to consider these important characteristics, so that your financial wellbeing has as much integrity as those who are handling it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9047619047619047,"src":"/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/26a4d/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/4e5cc/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/5398f/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/26a4d/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/897d1/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/57238/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/63a37869757b01b09ec863fe4e02fccd/23dde/assets.sourcemedia.com_-1.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"0ebd9aab-e100-5898-891f-ef702afaefdd","slug":"how-to-plan-for-summer-activities-and-budget","title":"How to Plan For Summer Activities and Budget","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope everyone had a great Memorial Day Weekend filled with fun, sun and lots of good food and pool time.  We took our kids to Washington DC to pay respects and educate them on the brave men and women that lost their lives fighting for our freedom.  As parents, lots of the chatter we’ve heard this past Memorial Day weekend centered around our kids. Whether exhausted from all the spring sports (both physically and financially) or trying to figure out what to do with the kids this summer, many of us are all in the same boat.   For those of us that work full-time or part-time, it is necessary to find coverage for our kids during the summer without breaking the bank &#8211; certainly no easy feat! Most summer camps do offer before and after care, but it’s an at an additional cost after already paying the pricey sticker price of a week of camp. For those that have a parent that stays home with the kids, there is the question of “how much camp can we justify spending on” or “what activities can we do with our kids each week without spending a fortune?”  There are no right answers to these questions, but there are ways to help reduce the stress of the financial burden of summer break. First, making a family budget that includes setting aside money for whatever your summer plans are is a MUST, and don’t forget to include some vacation funds too. Another way to save is to browse sites like Living Social, Certifikid and Groupon for deals on summer camps and other activities. There are also many great free or inexpensive options through your local recreation departments &#8211; look into classes offered at nature centers, libraries and aquatic facilities. These things may not take the  financial stress out of summer, but with a little proactive planning, you might just be able to make the costs a little easier to swallow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another of the major kid/life stressors that was a topic of conversation this past weekend is the growing cost of keeping our kids involved in sports.  A new survey finds that 27% of &#8220;sports parents&#8221; are spending $500 or more each month on their children&#8217;s activities.  Even though most of us realize our kids aren’t likely going to be the next LeBron James or Tom Brady, we still want to give them every opportunity to succeed with any sport they might have interest in. Whether that means enrolling them in specialized pitching clinics or joining the club soccer team, the bottom line is that it means spending hundreds, if not thousands, each month in registration fees, uniforms and new equipment, not to mention the gas and wear &amp; tear on our cars getting them to practice, tournaments and team-bonding events throughout the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A recent survey finds that sports parents spend twice as much time on their children’s activities than they do on financial planning. To keep money priorities straight, it is recommended that parents commit to a plan.  According to Dara Luber, senior manager of retirement at TD Ameritrade, you should “start by identifying your financial goals and creating savings buckets for each of them — your retirement, your children&#8217;s education, vacations and sports, to name a few. Be sure to fund those priorities in order of importance, putting your retirement first, Luber said. Then, have regular budget meetings with your family, so that your children understand the trade-offs of participating in costly sports programs, such as forgoing a family vacation.” There is nothing wrong with helping your son or daughter realize their sports dreams, but it definitely shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of your own retirement or understate your family&#8217;s needs,&#8221; Luber said.

We’d also love to be able to send them to whatever camp they desire, for weeks on end, but that’s not always realistic either.   Before we spend more money than necessary on these types of things, we must be honest with ourselves with what our future goals are. Teaching our children the importance of saving over spending and wants vs. needs. will benefit everyone in the family. With some strategic planning, you might just be able to take the vacation of your dreams or send them to that special once in a lifetime camp that they’ve been begging for.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.75,"src":"/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/26a4d/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/4e5cc/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/5398f/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/26a4d/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/897d1/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/57238/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/b1dc7f3aa546fc746a2c90b3fba01164/8719f/IMG_4229-e1559060640403-1.jpg 1536w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"9b20d434-cea7-5202-b1c0-65069dca9d52","slug":"lack-of-financial-literacy-in-americas-schools","title":"LACK OF FINANCIAL LITERACY IN AMERICA’S SCHOOLS","content":"<p>“According to <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5233033/average-debt-every-age/\">Money</a>, the average millennial household &#8220;owes $14,800 in student loans.&#8221; Writer Kerri Anne Renzulli explains that while debt averages vary across each generation, people of all ages are demonstrating a greater comfort with debt.

As part of this program, I spoke to the students about managing debt, establishing credit, the benefit of low interest rates on your monthly payments, and the idea of “wants vs. needs.”   In today’s world, many adults still struggle with these concepts and even many Wharton students lack a basic financial education.(<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/even-mba-students-could-use-some-basic-money-lessons.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/even-mba-students-could-use-some-basic-money-lessons.html</a>).

Powell knocked that idea, by explaining that the central bank still sees the weakness as the result of “transitory” factors, such as portfolio management services, lower apparel prices and airfares.  The Fed’s target on inflation is 2%, and the core PCE rate watched by the Fed fell to a surprising 1.6% in the first quarter.&#8221;   President Donald Trump, who earlier this week urged the Fed to cut the rate by 1 percentage point was most likely frustrated with the Fed chair as well.</p>\n<p>Since the Fed did not indicate which direction the next move may be, this is a good time to review any variable interest rates you have (student loans, etc.).

As the month of April is Financial Literacy Month, this was a great time for me to help make an impact in increasing the financial literacy among students. These students have the privilege of taking a business and finance course at the high school level. They are already much more advanced in their understanding of business operation and level of financial understanding than the majority of this country. As of 2019, 19 states require high school students to study financial literacy before earning a diploma, which is up from 17 in 2018 and 13 in 2011. It is great to see this progress year to year. At the business Pitch challenge, I listened to the students’ pitch which included a deep analysis of revenue, profit margin, and expenses of their business idea: a drone delivery service, which would deliver packages from door to door.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I encouraged the students to deepen their analysis by cutting costs through changing their business model from serving as a manufacturing company to serving as a software as a service business. This way, the company would be able to cut down on high fixed costs and focus on driving recurring revenue. The important thing to note is that the students were able to hold a discussion on cost-benefit analysis, while most high school students could not due to their limited understanding of financial metrics. Whether the Drone package delivery service would become a million -dollar company or not, these students have won the lottery by attending a school that would allow them to study finance before the rest of their peers across the country. The earlier students start to understand this material, the better. As they reach college and beyond, it is crucial that they become financially literate, which will make them financially smarter. It is crucial that young adults are able to make potentially complex decisions about student loans, mortgages, credit, and managing retirement-savings accounts. According to research studies, on average, students in states that require financial literacy courses in high school have lower credit card balances and pay for college using lower cost student loans than students living in states without this mandate. States with the mandate to incorporate financial literacy courses into the curriculum have seen an overall improvement in credit scores and a lower rate of late payments on credit cards among young adults. This shows how important it is for students to begin increasing their financial literacy as early as high school.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a financial advisory firm, Sherman Wealth is a big proponent of starting to increase financial literacy at an early age. We are excited that students in Montgomery county are working to increase their understanding of business strategy and financial information, which is what we think will help them long term. This is why I was excited to be a part of the business pitch competition and help coach the students into developing strategic ideas and better their business model</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4945652173913044,"src":"/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/d6959/unnamed-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/4e5cc/unnamed-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/5398f/unnamed-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/d9d2bda0de54432c17db0d4552f9395d/d6959/unnamed-1.jpg 275w","sizes":"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"3eb77729-d5b6-5c58-b77a-728b92c0f2e3","slug":"teachers-get-screwed-the-most","title":"Teachers Get Screwed The Most","content":"<p>It’s very unfortunate that school teachers, arguably one of the largest value-ads to communities across this nation, are getting taken to the woodshed on their retirement options. It’s 2019 and public school districts still haven’t found a way to properly help these individuals build a nest egg. We hear and see it all the time. In fact, we met with a 66-year old teacher yesterday from right here in <a href=\"https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/\">Montgomery Country</a>. As we wrapped up the introductory meeting, we already knew what would be uncovered as we began going over her statements.  Sure enough, we were correct. To be frank, seeing this stuff is really frustrating, especially to me, a son of a public school teacher, who learned all of this first hand.</p>\n<p>Most Americans who save for retirement at work have a basic 401(k) plan. These are offered at most companies and provide a decent selection of investment opportunities. The fees may be a little high, but these employees can build a properly diversified portfolio and it’s a win-win in the end for everyone involved. But there is a whole other sub-set of Americans who do <em>not</em> get to participate in a 401(k) plan. These include public school teachers, clergy members, employees of religious institutions or nonprofits, etc. These individuals are allowed to invest in what is known as a 403(b) plan. As a result, the people who do the most good in the world, spending their careers assisting others for below-average pay, often get screwed the most.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5165 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1.jpg 684w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/403b-fees-1-300x125.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Value after 35 years, assuming $250 contributed monthly with an 8% average annual return.<a href=\"https://403bwise.com/healthcare/content/61\"> Source</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But it’s not their fault. They have to invest in <em>something</em>, right? And if this is their only option, what else are they to do? Most 403(b) accounts are peppered with complex, expensive products that usually cost their owners tens of thousands of dollars over their careers. How is this possible? One reason is that the 403(b) accounts that many workers contribute to are not held to the same rules and regulations as a 401(k). When these employees are told that these are approved products, they automatically assume the school district did some due diligence on it. Think again. We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the district you work in doesn’t pay any attention to these plans or products. To them, it’s just another hassle.</p>\n<p>Be wary of any adviser who takes commissions of any sort from investment or insurance companies. Ask whether any adviser your organization hires will be on call for one-on-one advice, too. We once talked to a teacher who said she literally called around to vendors in her state, looking for anything with a fee under 1.50%. What’s the worst part? No one could meet those (very simple) requirements. In fact, according to the <a href=\"https://retirementandinvestmentblog.aon.com/getattachment/36ff81a4-db35-4bc0-aac1-1685d2a64078/How_403\">analysis</a> prepared by Aon Hewitt, the average fees charged on variable and fixed annuities and mutual funds included in a 403(b) plan look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variable annuities: 2.25%.</li>\n<li>Fixed annuities: 1.15%.</li>\n<li>Mutual funds: 0.97%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By contrast, the average expense ratio of an ETF is just 0.44%. Unfortunately, ETFs <a href=\"https://www.plansponsor.com/blines-ask-the-experts-etfs-in-a-403b-plan/\">rarely appear</a> as an investment option in 403(b) plans.</p>\n<p>So, who’s fault is this? Ultimately, it falls on the individual school districts to properly vet the companies and salesman who are finding their ways into schools, like cockroaches in the night. We wrote a <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/are-managers-responsible-for-their-employees-retirement/\">piece</a> recently on why it’s an employer’s responsibility to ensure that their employees are being properly educated and informed on their retirement options. It is not the individuals responsibility to research the best choices. In all honesty, these individuals wouldn’t even know where to start in regards to due diligence between various products and funds.</p>\n<p>In the end, 403(b) plans in the modern world are outdated compared to their for-profit employer 401(k) plan peers by roughly 20 years. Most importantly, their existing multi-provider record keeper platforms, incredibly long investment menus, and inability to employ proper, institutionally-focused investment options have created an environment that impairs retirement outcomes for participants. It’s a sad reality for those who contribute to our society in such a respectable and positive way.</p>\n<p>If you are school teacher and are having trouble navigating your 403(b) plan and are unsure of where to turn for conflict free advice, please feel free to <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">reach out to us</a> and we&#8217;d be happy to assist you and any manner.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.6920415224913494,"src":"/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/26a4d/sad-teacher-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/4e5cc/sad-teacher-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/5398f/sad-teacher-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/26a4d/sad-teacher-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/897d1/sad-teacher-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/57238/sad-teacher-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/9cbe24fc39518b1b902f6bd8248c507f/7f0bc/sad-teacher-1.jpg 978w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"2984df9e-b247-5add-9ca0-7b98ffdab6b0","slug":"the-importance-of-financial-literacy","title":"The Importance of Financial Literacy","content":"<p>It was recently announced that the state of South Carolina was pushing to pass a bill that would require all high school students to take a course on financial literacy in order to graduate. Five states (Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia) are the only other states to have passed a similar law. As professionals who strive to preach the importance of this topic, we are very happy to see these developments. In fact, we think it’s particularly great that we, as a nation, are beginning to demand that children learn the basic of personal finance, <em>before</em> they step out into the real world.</p>\n<p>But first off, let’s tackle what the actual definition of “financial literacy” is. Financial literacy is the combination of financial, credit and debt management and the overall knowledge that is required to make responsible decisions regarding financial matters. Really, we are talking about the impact of finances on the daily issues an average family may encounter.</p>\n<p>Is the rate of financial literacy low in the US? Yep. (Actually, it’s low <a href=\"http://gflec.org/initiatives/sp-global-finlit-survey/\">around the world</a>.) Of course, the level of financial literacy varies according to education and income levels. However, there is a lot of evidence out there that shows that highly educated individuals with above-average incomes are almost equally as under-educated on these topics as those who may live a more modest lifestyle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5154\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1199\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1.jpg 1199w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-300x101.jpg 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-1024x344.jpg 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/financial-literacy-stats-1-768x258.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px\" /></a></p>\n<p>source: <a href=\"http://gflec.org/initiatives/sp-global-finlit-survey/\">S&amp;P GLOBAL FINLIT SURVEY</a></p>\n<p>Given this information, it is becoming increasingly more important to ensure that we are preparing our children with this knowledge well before they are starting college, creating families, and living an “adult” life. Why? Because it’s about the “long game”. Financial literacy is critical in helping people plan for retirement and avoiding high levels of debt. Last year, a <a href=\"https://www.tiaainstitute.org/sites/default/files/presentations/2017-02/economic_importance_of_financial_literacy.pdf\">study from TIAA-CREF</a> showed that those with high levels of financial literacy  are more likely to make astute decisions and typically, over their lifetime, amass twice as much wealth as those without a plan.</p>\n<p>If you can’t build a simple household budget, then you are likely financially illiterate. If you are oblivious to money-related decisions, are unsure of the consequences of these decisions, or you simply don’t care, then you’re financially illiterate. Most importantly, If you have learned the “hard way” over the years that not being up-to-date on financial matters has affected your life in a negative way, it is imperative that you do not allow your children to make the same mistakes. Important financial decisions are popping up earlier and earlier in life, as the world becomes more complex. You don’t “build” wealth and <em>then</em> figure out how to manage it properly. That ability to grow comes with managing it properly along the way.</p>\n<p>The statistics mentioned above are some of main reasons we have created the &#8220;Beers with Brad&#8221; seminar series. We feel that increasing your financial literacy is incredibly important to your long term financial goals and obligations.

While this seems very simple on the outside, the findings are quite complex. Here’s a great example: only 50% of US workers participate in a workplace retirement plan. While some don’t have access to this type of benefit, many do have access, and simply don’t take advantage of it. Yet, we know that saving for retirement (and taking every advantage) is the optimal route to take.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Most of us would say we make wise decisions for ourselves and our families, but the data does not back up this sentiment. Thaler has also found that people only save money if it’s automatic. Thus, he feels to most important aspects of a 401(k) offering are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Automatic enrollment</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Automatic escalation</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Good default low-cost investment options</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Helping individuals roll their 401(k) into an IRA when they change jobs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Again, this seems like a very easy concept for CEOs and managers to adopt, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. Thaler proclaims, “If the employees at your firm are not saving enough for retirement, realize that it is your fault. And that is because we know how to make saving for retirement much easier and more successful.” But since so many workers <em>aren’t</em> saving, he places the blame on the managers themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But why should you care? Because the financial wellness of your employees will affect the bottom line of your business. <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/139373/business-case-wellbeing.aspx\">A report released by Gallup</a> on the Economics of Well-being tells us that having a low sense of financial stability can lead to “stress, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, and depression”. All of these emotions lead to reduced productivity and output. And worse? Employee retention also tends to spike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Step one: HR managers and senior executives should make 401(k) participation an “opt-out” decision. This creates a wall to prevent individuals from harming themselves by passing on automatic retirement savings. Second, escalating the amount of these contributions -over time &#8211; will allow your employees to increase their savings rate. Most studies have shown that <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://thefinancetwins.com/personal-savings-rate/\">your monthly savings rate is the number one statistic</a> that will decide whether you will be able to retire on time or not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Third, it is imperative that these retirement plans have low-cost investment options for employees to choose from. Simple index funds really will get the job done. In much of his work, Thaler points to the fact that humans are consistently irrational, so nudging them towards smart investment choices is important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The key to checking off these boxes is most likely automation. Managers and CEOs have the authority to make these decisions. In theory, the financial stability of your employees (and the ability for them to <em>feel </em>that stability) is largely dependent these types of executives. However, when said managers do indeed take these steps, it’s really a win-win situation for everyone involved. Your employees’ minds aren’t elsewhere, worrying about paying the mortgage or whether they have enough saved to cover a medical emergency. Employees come to work with a clear head. They feel happier and therefore you get more production out of your employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you are a small business owner and feel that you may be spending too much on 401(k) plan costs or that your employees are bringing non-related stress into the workplace, please<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\"> feel free to reach out</a> to us.

After all, the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/02/26/raising-child-costs-233-610-you-financially-prepared-parent/357243002/\">average cost of raising a child today</a> in middle-class America is nearly $250,000, excluding college tuition expenses. These types of numbers leave many couples in “catch up” mode when it comes to their savings and retirement planning.</p>\n<p>The first step, as we all know, is creating a plan. You can’t make any headway towards debt and savings goals without a clear, executable strategy. Three big keys are: concentrate on building up your investments, boost your credit, and reevaluate your real estate needs. This is a major inflection point in your life, and thus an ideal time to consider all these topics.</p>\n<p>Regarding your savings, your cash flow is (hopefully) growing, or at least turning positive. Because you have a limited amount of time to get things in order, taking action in the areas mentioned above should be done as soon as possible, especially if any emergency funds have been drained. More parents tend to undersave and overspend while their children are still living under their roof. Here are some questions to ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do we have enough cash to make it through the next economic contraction or bear market?</li>\n<li>Is our credit card debt manageable?</li>\n<li>Are the balances in our 401(k) and IRA accounts where they need to be?</li>\n<li>Is our house “too much” for us without the children?</li>\n<li>Do they kids still need insurance?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that some of your larger expenses have come and gone, there must be a mental shift from “paying the bills” to “creating a better future”. You will need to monitor your assets more closely now, and extra money should be going more towards retirement accounts and less towards material things. There is good news for those who may be a little behind, as <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19000-for-2019-ira-limit-increases-to-6000\">the IRS has increased contribution limits in 2019</a> for 401(k) and IRA accounts.</p>\n<p>However, one key to keeping your nest empty is taking the time to educate your children on the importance of personal finance. This is a very important step in creating and maintaining a “moat” around your new-found savings. The more educated your children are on the basics of day-to-day money management, the less likely they are to need your assistance in the immediate future. These are great opportunities to preach to them about not living beyond their means, sticking to a budget, saving a little each month, and the consequences of debt.</p>\n<p>There are a few important things than can be tackled that will allow you to get off on the right foot towards rebuilding your retirement savings. The key is to capitalize on the new-found opportunities to do so. And one of those, in this moment, is a focus on your future, not your child’s future. Of course you should give them the tools to financially fend for themselves, but going forward the main goal is retirement for you and your spouse.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5325670498084292,"src":"/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/26a4d/empty-nest-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/4e5cc/empty-nest-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/5398f/empty-nest-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/26a4d/empty-nest-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/897d1/empty-nest-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/57238/empty-nest-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/526a4/empty-nest-1.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"a908535e-1a31-5a0f-a909-128354d5d833","slug":"tips-for-furloughed-workers-during-the-shutdown","title":"Tips for furloughed workers during the shutdown","content":"<p>Before we get started, lets recognize that this isn’t the first time there’s been a shutdown, and it probably won’t be the last. But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that so many workers are now reaching their third week of no pay. There are roughly 800,000 federal employees who are not receiving paychecks right now, many of whom are located right here in the DC Metro area. While some are technically on a &#8220;leave of absence&#8221;, many are being expected to work for no pay. What&#8217;s worse is that federal employees already make, on average, quite a bit less than their private sector peers. On top of this, while most workers are expecting to be paid retroactively once the shutdown is over, it’s not mandatory.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, take a look at your monthly budget and find items you can easily remove.</p>\n<p>Another helpful tip is to contact your bank. In fact, one institution headquartered here in the DC Metro, Navy Federal Credit Union,  is extending a zero-interest loan up to $6,000 with no fees and a grace period. Many banks are willing to make exceptions. Bank of America and Wells Fargo also have outreach programs that assist federal employees. Most institutions have similar processes in place for their employees that allow them to contact creditors and landlords in order to ask for assistance.</p>\n<p>Another step that federal employees can take is to proactively reach out to creditors. Best move? Develop a simple letter that explains your situation: &#8220;I am a government employee who has lost income due to the government shutdown. Due to these events, my income has been drastically reduced for the time being and I am unable to make my payment in full this month.&#8221; On top this, don&#8217;t forget to include account numbers and contact information with the letter.</p>\n<p>While filing for unemployment may seem like the best &#8220;quick fix&#8221;, that isn&#8217;t necessarily true. A large portion of these federal employees can apply for unemployment while on temporary leave of absence. Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t cover everyone. For those who are expected to report to work without pay (as mentioned above), do not qualify for these benefits. In most states (and D.C.), if you collect unemployment benefits, and then receive retroactive your pay, you will indeed be require to repay the government.</p>\n<p>If you are a government worker who participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, you may take loans from their retirement savings if the furlough is expected to last 30 days or less. You may not take the loan if your leave goes beyond that period. However, remember than once you remove money from your retirement account, that money is no long invested in the market. You will also be required to repay the money, so this should be used as a last resort.</p>\n<p>One last note to keep in mind: Be skeptical about picking up work while you are on furlough. Even though the government is shut down, you are still an employee of the federal government. Because of this, certain employment (outside the scope of your federal job)may be restricted.</p>\n<p>While these tips may bring short-term relief, the best course of action is to develop a long-term plan for these types of situations. This will be the first time that a government shutdown has extended past two pay periods, making the financial situation for many households that much tighter. No one knows how long the current shutdown will last, or when the next will arise, and that is exactly the reason to be prepared for these types of scenarios.</p>\n<p>If you are federal employee who has questions about your day-to-day income during the shutdown, and are wanting to talk to a professional, please f<a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">eel free to reach out</a> to us.

Which reminded me that now is a great time to revisit your W-4. Why? Because t’s very, very likely that the W-4 form on file with your employer is off. Last year, the Treasury Department and the IRS released <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/2019-tax-brackets/\">updated withholding tables </a>(below) to reflect the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Pay too much, and you end up with a large refund. On top that, while earning a bigger paycheck twice a month sounds awesome, it could come back to hurt you come April. With all this being said, we obviously want to be as close to zero as possible. But how do we accomplish this in a changing tax environment?</p>\n<p>Prior to 2019, it was common to withhold less from your pay if you had deductions that were itemized. However, that may no longer hold true considering the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/taxes/2019/01/08/5-popular-tax-deductions-that-took-big-hits-from-t.aspx\">standard deduction is nearly twice</a> what it previously was. Due of these new tax laws, a high percentage of households who itemized in previous years will no longer be able to do so (another reason to check up your withholding). Previous laws also allowed income earners to withhold less in taxes if you they had dependents. Going forward, these types of exemptions are gone, so those filers should review their pay stub to ensure that they’re not under-withheld.</p>\n<p>Another reason to make sure your refund isn&#8217;t &#8220;too big&#8221; is because you will, more or less, be giving the government an interest-free loan. With cash accounts now paying above 2%, that money is better off working for you in your own account.

Investors, who are probably over the volatility from 2018, were unfortunately required to sit through a couple more brutal sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its worst start a year since 2000. However, following a reassuring tone from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, large indices will actually finish the week in positive territory.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, President Trump seemingly doubled down on his willingness to let the government shutdown continue. The President is staying solid on his refusal to sign any funding bill that does not include $5 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats remain insistent they will not provide the votes to give him that funding as the shutdown now stands at fourteen days.</p>\n<p>Much of the worry in stocks began on Wednesday, when Apple had its worst day in 5 years, moving down almost 10% at one point. The company slashed its quarterly revenue outlook (almost a month before it’s scheduled earnings report), blaming its lowered projections on soft iPhone sales in Asia, with CEO Tim Cook publicly attributing some of the weakness to U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>\n<p>Financial markets have been in turmoil over the past several months, in part over concern whether the Fed was being too aggressive in its stance on hiking rates. In fact, Chairman Powell himself has helped to fuel some of that speculation. On Friday, Powell did offer remarks to show that Fed policy will take into account economic conditions and be adjusted accordingly. Powell also noted that the economy still looks quite strong.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WR-1-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5038\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WR-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"844\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WR-1-1.png 844w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WR-1-1-300x176.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WR-1-1-768x450.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px\" /></a></p>\n<p>According to the data release this week, U.S. employers added 312,000 new jobs last month, nearly double the Street consensus of 177,000.

Year after year we see the same types of studies and the alarming statistics they produce in regards to savings and retirement planning (or lack thereof). </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-big-reason-americans-are-so-stressed-and-unhealthy-2018-10-11?link=sfmw_tw\">Almost half of Americans</a></span><span class=\"s1\"> (44% to be exact) list money as the largest contributor to stress in their lives. To make matters worse, the stress isn’t confined to the household. A <a href=\"http://jhrps.com/Wellness\"><span class=\"s2\">recent John Hancock study</span></a> found that 72% of us take our money worries into the workplace with us, clearly affecting more of our daily lives than we would like. That same study claims that this stress causes physical and psychological problems (anxiety, sleeplessness, etc.) for nearly 60% of us. Many will say that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/why-dont-americans-save-money/478929/\"><span class=\"s2\">American’s simply cannot afford to save money</span></a> anymore. Medical expenses are high. Housing is expensive. Short-term burdens make it hard to plan for long-term goals. Many work at a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Rising number of single-parent households. The list is endless. And trust me, I get it. I totally understand these hurdles can be intimidating.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But at the end of the day, these are all just excuses. Just like they were excuses last year and the year before that. We constantly spend our time fretting over these topics, but ironically never put a plan together to actually get ahead. It’s the same scenario as the person who feels they are overweight, goes to the gym for two weeks each January, and then eventually gives up on their weight loss plan. You need a plan. And better yet, you need someone that is going to hold you accountable to that plan. Without a well-established roadmap, how are you going to reach your final destination? No one ever accomplished anything without executing a plan! And it’s not just about a retirement plan. Having a plan for weekly and monthly expenses will build the mental consistency that is required for longer term goals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don’t let 2019 be another year of day-to-day stress, secretly praying that no unexpected expenses pop up between now and your next paycheck. It’s a vicious cycle that is hard to remove yourself from unless you come up with a concrete plan of action and stick with it. Making more money is not the key to living a financially stress-free life. It can help, sure. But with out a plan you will eventually fall back into the same, undisciplined routine. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are having trouble developing a plan or are unsure where to start, <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\">please feel free to reach out to us</a>.

Coming into the month of December, we were told how, historically, this is a bullish time of year for equities. Unfortunately, “historically” is just another term for “average” and while December may typically be a strong month, that was not the case this year. It’s usually a positive month, rarely negative. But it looks like 2018 will not see a normal December, which would make sense considering how the full year has played out in general.<a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4775\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png 624w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1-300x177.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trade tariffs continue to garner the most attention in headlines.

We may not see a sustained move in either direction (up or down) until some kind of formal agreement has been reached between the two parties.</p>\n<p>To add to the worries, signs from abroad have not been much better. British Prime Minister Theresa May has fallen on tough times in regards to her Brexit battle, now fighting for her own political life. This week, a right-wing faction in her own party triggered a “no confidence” vote following May’s decision to postpone the debate over a deal that could have finally brought closure to the issue as a whole, which initially arose over two years ago. In China, weak economic data shows that the trade tensions are severely affecting their economy, with weaker than expected industrial output and retail sales numbers. On top of this, the reports out of Europe weren’t any better. In fact, the German and French private sectors (arguably the two most important in the Eurozone) are trending downwards in terms of growth. Further, Italian debt issues keep the country on the brink of recession. Despite the headline worries and weak economic showings in foreign economies, the US data continue to produce strong numbers, although some areas are starting to slow. Retail sales remain high, while manufacturing and service sectors output fell to new lows.

The conflicting positive and negative news has kept us in a large trading range over the last two months, as you can see below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-1-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4766\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-1-1.png 840w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-1-1-300x177.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-1-1-768x453.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The US unemployment numbers posted a decent increase this past week, with non-farm payrolls <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/business/economy/jobs-report.html\">increasing for the 98<sup>th</sup> month in a row</a>. This is by far the longest streak of month-over-month job growth in history. Average hourly earnings also saw a small bump. The overall unemployment rate still stands at 3.7%, the lowest since 1969. Interestingly enough, a separate gauge that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons, sometimes called the real unemployment rate, rose from 7.4% percent to 7.6%.

First off, crude oil prices have fallen from $76 to $50 per barrel recently, which should cause some relief at the pump for consumers. In fact, national gasoline <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/12/07/gas-prices-reach-new-2018-low/\">prices fell to $2.46/gallon</a>, a new low for 2018. A main cause of the lower prices has been the massive over-production here in the US. On the other hand, natural gas prices have seen a large spike over the last few weeks, in large part due to the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/natural-gas-prices-have-surged-over-the-last-month-heres-why.html\">lowest stockpiles of gas</a> in nearly a decade. So, while you may be saving money when you fill up your car for a long road trip over the holidays, you may see a higher natural gas than usual as we go further into the winter months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4769\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"843\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png 843w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1-300x177.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1-768x452.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you are feeling a little antsy over the recent market volatility, I would like to bring your attention to the chart below. The average intra-year drop on the S&amp;P 500 is roughly 14%. So far this year we have experienced two declines, one of 12.8% (January &#8211; February) and one around 11.3% (October). Both are below the average. These types of swings are experienced on an annual basis. Due to the fact that 2017 was such a low volatility year (as mentioned above), recency bias has kicked in and has many believing that the 2018 environment is seeing above-average fluctuations. It is not.

That time when mutual fund companies report distributions for capital gains taxes. Just in time for the holidays and a total buzzkill on all of that discretionary spending you planned on participating in.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“But I’m in a Buy &amp; Hold portfolio and didn’t sell. How can I have a taxable gain?” Ah, this is where one of the (many) hidden flaws of investing in mutual funds comes into the picture. It’s not about what you, the investor and shareholder, buy and sell. It’s about what happens behind the curtains of the fund you’re invested in. Probably not something your advisor has taken the time to explain to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A capital gains distribution is a payment to shareholders that is prompted by a fund manager&#8217;s liquidation of underlying stocks and securities in a mutual fund or derived from dividend and interest earned by the fund&#8217;s holdings minus the fund&#8217;s operating expenses. Further, </span><span class=\"s2\">these distributions must be made</span><span class=\"s1\"> because tax law dictates that substantial portion of investment income and capital gains must be paid to investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“But my return on the fund is essentially flat (or negative) for the year. Why is the distribution so high?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Again, this is one of the most frustrating things about mutual funds and why they are, for the most part, terribly inefficient from a tax perspective. Regardless of how long the investor owned the fund, the distributions are taxed based on how long the fund itself held the sold holdings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Can you imagine owning a fund that returned 1-2% in 2018 and being told you are going to get hit with a 10% (or even larger in some circumstances) taxable event? It’s not even your choice. Was your “buy and hold” game plan specifically built to be tax-conscious? Well, maybe in theory it was. But reality is different. Even many Vanguard mutual funds are paying massive distributions in 2018. This is a big deal for investors with assets in accounts that aren’t a 401(k) or IRA.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In an <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/890938/more-tax-pain-for-some-mutual-fund-shareholders-in.html\">excellent piece</a> by Christine Benz earlier this month, she points to the fact that “many mutual funds are likely to dish out capital gains distributions that are on par with&#8211;or even higher than&#8211;years past adds insult to injury.” Mutual funds that need to raise cash can sell profitable investments and create capital gains for investors, even if the fund has performed poorly. This means you can lose money on an investment in a mutual fund but still end up owing taxes. As I mentioned above, capital gains in a mutual fund get passed along to its investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> An <a href=\"https://www.etftrends.com/etf-strategist-channel/etfs-tax-time/\"><span class=\"s2\">interesting article</span></a> put out by ETF Trends states that ETFs have tax efficiency built into the structure. The “exchange traded” attribute of the ETF structure allows investors to purchase and sell shares without creating or redeeming small odd-lots. This is very different from mutual funds where every day mismatched buyers and sellers force transactions and tax implication in the underlying fund. The tax implications from these transactions become liabilities to those still holding the mutual fund shares. Furthermore, the creation and redemption process, which allows for in-kind transaction with Authorized Participants (APs) can further reduce the likelihood of creating a distributable capital gain in the ETF structure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With all this said, I again point to the fact that ETFs, particularly from a taxable income standpoint, are much more optimal for investors over the long term. There are plenty of other arguments (closet indexing, high(er) fees, diversification, etc.) of why we continue to promote the use of ETFs over mutual funds, but tax consequences are by far one of the top reasons we advise clients to steer clear. Forget Sharpe Ratios and standard deviation statistics, if you want to talk about risk…it’s simply not worth the risk of getting hit by a major taxable event. Remove those possibilities from your game plan and look to ETFs as the proper vehicle to reach the goals you’ve set for your portfolio.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you would like to have your portfolio analyzed for fees and tax efficiency schedule a time to chat with us <a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">here </a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.917808219178082,"src":"/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/26a4d/taxhazard-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/4e5cc/taxhazard-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/5398f/taxhazard-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/26a4d/taxhazard-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/cf658/taxhazard-1.jpg 560w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"bc1e6be2-990c-591e-8819-64a76fbd95aa","slug":"the-2019-contribution-limits-are-here","title":"The 2019 Contribution Limits Are Here!","content":"<p>Great news for savers!

Talking about and managing finances together","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money woes are the leading cause of divorce in American couples. Over ⅓ of people in the United States have stated that financial pressure was the biggest challenge their marriage has faced in the past, and ¼ of Americans have said most of their arguments are money-related. As a financial planner, I work with a lot of couples &#8211; and I’m always surprised by how few of them have actually had an honest conversation about their money. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old saying holds true when it comes to household finances &#8211; communication is key. When you work toward creating a financial plan with your spouse, you need to talk to each other about expectations, frustrations, and any goals or dreams you may have. That being said, money conversations can also be incredibly uncomfortable &#8211; which is probably why so many American couples avoid them altogether. Knowing what you’re walking into, and how to best talk about money with your spouse ahead of time, can help you have a productive conversation. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know Yourself and Know Your Spouse</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to point fingers when it comes to money because it’s frustrating to admit our own faults. We may be harboring some guilt around unhealthy spending habits, or be embarrassed because we don’t know as much as we think we should about saving for retirement. On the other hand, our money mindset may be a direct result of how we were raised &#8211; and it may be different from how our spouse approaches their finances. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding where you fall down when it comes to your personal finances is key in order to talk to your spouse about building a financial plan that’s going to work for your family. When you know your own flaws, you’re able to create a plan of action that helps you to stay on track &#8211; which is something your spouse will appreciate. It’s also important to understand your spouse’s money mindset, as well as their financial strengths and weaknesses. Having a clear understanding of how each of you approach financial decisions, or value your money will help you to align your vision for the future (and avoid arguments down the road).</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approach Financial Opinions With No Judgement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal finance is always emotionally charged. Everyone has opinions on how money should be handled, and often they differ dramatically &#8211; even between an otherwise compatible couple. Money conversations between two spouses who have different opinions </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">money can evolve into arguments quickly. The key is to approach all financial opinions your spouse may hold without judgement. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, this sounds easy &#8211; it’s not. For example, if you firmly believe in paying down debt and living a debt free lifestyle, but your spouse sees the benefit in carrying some debt and would prefer to prioritize saving before debt repayment &#8211; you may find yourself falling into the trap of judging them for their opinion because you strongly believe that yours is “right.” The truth is, when it comes to money, there are no “right” opinions. Opinions are just that &#8211; opinions. They’re based on a value set and history that someone has with their personal finances. They aren’t fact, and they aren’t “wrong.” Knowing that your spouse’s financial opinions aren’t right or wrong (and neither are yours) can help you move through conversations without assigning emotional value to their ideas.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also important to avoid judgement of each other’s financial past. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/27/1-in-8-divorces-are-caused-by-student-loans.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 in 8 divorces</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are directly caused by student loan debt. The pressure that hefty debt, a lack of savings, or other financial missteps you bring to the table can potentially alienate your spouse. Working together to be on the same “team” when it comes to addressing these money woes is key.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set Goals Together</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you’re discussing your family’s finances, you’re going to come to a point where you need to set goals that you’re working toward. It’s tempting to set individual goals and work independently toward them, but that’s a recipe for financial dissonance in your household. Talking through your money goals, and working to align them with the values you share as a couple, can help you lay a foundation of financial peace in your home. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you set financial goals together as a married couple, you’re actively working to approach your money situation as a team. You’re building a safety net that protects both of you, planning for the lifestyle you want as a unit, and staying honest with one another. Once you’ve set goals as a team, you can move forward with creating a game plan that puts you on the path to reach those goals. This might mean creating a household budget, setting up automatic payments to knock out your debt or build up your savings, or building in “rewards” like a date night once you hit smaller milestones on your way to your long-term goals. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re struggling to find common ground when it comes to your  money, </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talking to a fiduciary, fee-only financial advisor can help</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. An impartial third party can often guide you in taking the emotion, or blame, out of your personal finances and help get you and your spouse on the same team when it comes to your money. </span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAYAAACNiR0NAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAEaUlEQVQ4y02UW28bVRDH99PwCZD4HPCCxHt54wUqgaCilZDaqkgg2lJEARWI0oaWNJc6zsWOEzuxk9hO7NhO4tv6sl5717f1PXfnxzknVcXDX3N8ZuZ//jM7Y80uZ2hUcrSqOu1aAccqKnTskoJjF9/dSb+Mk/ESdjmLqR9SyiYoHMXJpXbRrFIGq5RWAU0zryCT3sHU3xFJX93IKkgh1eIRRj5FMb1P/mCPbDIqCIWj1zDoNsp062WGTlX9Hjk1Tnu2sFX6TYNB22QocNypKeUyRlqrnMY2rsnTiTBaKrnF7OxzQsEVEokQAf8iej7O3m4Av9/N/n4Q28qSy+0hYwPirlhMEAmvqZxMOopv9Q0LrpcU9DhaNLrON7du8uzZz8y/meL5898JbXlwu19x795tJiefsr3jweWa4k8Rc+/ut2wJ/8rKDBMTv+L1zvHDD3d5+OgBNSuDVq2mabeL9PsmZ2dNYMjVVUfYrkCPy3Ff2BOBU64YKf/4sgVXjoo7PW0wELmtVgHTPEKz7SydTpnjY5vxuC2CnLdkfUUIOYGYQATOklwcm+I8FrhQceOxo3Ilh+TSGo08vZ4hXqoLp1A3HglI0hYndR/dnQ9xcjfoHd6g+OwDrF/eo+37mBPTpR68VlkXHBUkl9Zs6gxHgkwpS4pSphmfPRbnH2kX7pNe/ox66muBJ3RKOwySk9gLn3Ac/4jLtke14vy8zmBgIrm0tiM/fxyn8IiO8RVD6yFXl34RmBVV5WjnZtld+o6N+TsE3L+xvvSCcGCG4PIjHt++STmTUEr7/QqtZgHN6VrU9Xmefv4+gemnoj2yd7L5DsOuTkVfZHPuS2Yefkpw5gHVjJeusUFy/TWTj3+i71RUL4fDqvowouSCkFvAzk9hHf1F9XCCfPQJ4YU7LP79Ba//uEXg1X12Xj4gH1lg0NI5G1U5HdZUry8u24xGliq3VhNjU6/n6HYNzk5yHDsbtEtzlBNT6PHX1HIeurUo56OyGp1Oz6JipimXD6lUjiiVxNoVk8rmcjF0fR+tZok+OSb1Ron+wOLkRKybUHAivtzouMlQQN4PhSLZq4vzlhIgYdviT6KhI2f5emxyaKYREcu/RsfR1TyNRrYINkVARdyJHe5XxcA31ACfnze5uGi9s/JxuRASslLDOBAKC/P0Ct/TbcXE+Ngq+XpTem8xoFpLUywlRElxykaKbHaXpNjrcMRHKLRCQ/TvmjCFFg+7ONqbJZ3aIZ+OYRQPqBlpLDODXc0qyHPVOKIifJXSgbJ6NkbmMEoyFiIRC7IXCbC16UHzLbnYXPMSWl9h2+8hHt7gILZNIhpkP7JJMhoiuRtS99HgGuFNH9sBLwGvm9XFOQXf0jyLc//yZnpKEC7PC6eLDd+iIF3+H+GmIpTEqb0tdY6G1ogEfWz5VwisupG5kszrnsU18w/z0y/QvIuz1y8JhySN7QSu1Yjk3a119VuS7W37hbpVpU5W4/csKCLPwgzuuVdMT00o/AcPiIAbvC4sPgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/b8ce2fec035a0bcb14f8839559117cb6/cad89/BE-ON-THE-SAME-TEAM-1.png","srcSet":"/static/b8ce2fec035a0bcb14f8839559117cb6/1d716/BE-ON-THE-SAME-TEAM-1.png 100w,\n/static/b8ce2fec035a0bcb14f8839559117cb6/f0031/BE-ON-THE-SAME-TEAM-1.png 200w,\n/static/b8ce2fec035a0bcb14f8839559117cb6/cad89/BE-ON-THE-SAME-TEAM-1.png 400w,\n/static/b8ce2fec035a0bcb14f8839559117cb6/d4196/BE-ON-THE-SAME-TEAM-1.png 600w,\n/static/b8ce2fec035a0bcb14f8839559117cb6/3995d/BE-ON-THE-SAME-TEAM-1.png 800w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"e892872d-7e93-58cd-b695-044b5b9e3c4c","slug":"what-is-an-hsa-and-why-is-it-important","title":"What is an HSA and Why Is It Important","content":"<p><iframe title=\"Sherman Wealth | Maximizing Your HSA\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sApWZfHBnac?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve likely heard that having an HSA can help you to lower the cost of your medical care &#8211; but studies have shown that only </span><a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/hsa-enrollment-rises-as-employer-contributions-fall.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17% of people</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enrolled in group health plans are using their HSA. And of the people who are using their HSA, only a few of them are contributing the maximum amount each year. This gap is largely because not everyone knows about HSAs or their many benefits. As is usually the case with personal finance, the more you know, the better decisions you’re able to make. So let’s take a minute to break down what, exactly, an HSA is and how you can use it to your benefit.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is an An HSA?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An HSA, or Health Savings Account, is attached to High Deductible Health Plan insurance coverage (HDHP). In order to open an HSA, you have to be enrolled in HDHP insurance. The HSA is intended to offset the high medical costs often associated with HDHP insurance coverage &#8211; which has a high deductible (hence the name), and puts group members in a position where they have to pay out of pocket for most non-essential care services until their deductible is met. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your HSA is funded with pre-tax money, and it grows tax free.. More importantly, it rolls over from year to year, so you’re continually growing your funds without feeling pressured to use them immediately. Keep in mind that your HSA funds can only be used for qualifying medical expenses. This can include everything from doctor copays to hospital bills to a box of bandaids from your local grocery store. Putting money aside into an HSA helps to lower your taxable income while still preparing for a medical emergency, or even just offsetting smaller medical expenses &#8211; like taking your kids to the doctor. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know What You Can Contribute</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because contributions to your HSA lower your taxable income, it’s a good idea to contribute as much as you can. The current contribution limits are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$3450 if you’re single</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$6900 for a family</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add an extra $1000 to either of those figures if you’re over 55 years old</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people use their HSA to save for larger medical procedures &#8211; like having a baby, or intensive surgery. Others use it to put money aside for rising medical costs during retirement. Knowing what you can contribute is the first step to understanding what the best way to use your HSA might be. Some employers even offer a program where they assist in contributing to your HSA &#8211; which increases the total amount you’re able to save for future medical costs. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HSAs and HDHP insurance plans were originally created in hopes that if an insured individual was forced to spend their own funds on health related costs, they’d spend wisely. While this logic might work for some, others have figured out how to work the system to their advantage and use their HSA for several different financial planning purposes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To save for upcoming medical costs like cold medicine, doctor visit copays, or medical procedures</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To save for future medical costs during retirement</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To lower their taxable income</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an investment vehicle</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember: You Own Your HSA</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you create a plan for your HSA funds, it’s important to remember that you own them, not your employer. Even if you set up the account through your employer originally, you get to take that account with you wherever you choose to work in the future (or into your retirement). That’s why researching your HSA provider to ensure you’re getting the benefits </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> want is critical. It’s also important to remember that you won your HSA &#8211; and get to decide what happens to the funds in the account. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means you can decide whether you want your HSA funds to remain all-cash, or if you want to invest all or a portion of them. Additionally, you get to decide who the beneficiary is on your account, and if you want to proceed with a one-time roll over or transfer of funds from your IRA to your HSA. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think Smart &#8211; Protect Yourself</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like to view an HSA as an added layer of protection for clients. Putting money aside in an HSA has clear tax benefits, and it’s handy to have when you hit retirement. More than that, though, clients who contribute to an HSA because they’re enrolled in a high-deductible insurance plan are protecting themselves against the unknown. As a financial planner, I talk a lot about building an emergency savings and thinking about your future. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially true for </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/entrepreneurs-separate-biz-and-personal-finances/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entrepreneurs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or young families who are working to pay down debt, grow their retirement savings, and reach other financial goals &#8211; like purchasing a home. Your HSA is an added layer of insulation against the inevitable. Eventually, something will go wrong with your health (or a family member’s health).  In our case it has helped with medical bills for the kids and recently my cardiologist appointments (dont worry everything is fine). </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not uncommon for people to go into massive amounts of debt trying to pay off thousands of dollars of hospital bills after a car accident, or when their kid breaks their arm, or because they’ve been hit particularly hard by flu season. Don’t let the unexpected force you to sideline your big-picture financial goals. Regularly contributing to an HSA, or finding another way to set money aside for medical expenses, can help keep you on track.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7070347284060552,"src":"/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/cad89/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png","srcSet":"/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/1d716/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 100w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/f0031/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 200w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/cad89/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 400w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/d4196/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 600w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/3995d/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 800w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/a2fce/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 1588w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"6aa8a00d-2823-5381-8a84-48465feb65d0","slug":"good-judge-ment-means-good-planning","title":"Good Judge-ment Means Good Planning","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Were you surprised to learn that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court justice nominee with an annual income of $247,000, could have racked up debt and saved so little for retirement?  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/brett-kavanaugh-explanation-for-crippling-credit-card-debt-is-pure-maga\">A recent article in Vanity Fair</a> reports that the Washington native accrued between $60,000 and $200,000 on three credit cards and a loan for Washington Nationals tickets as well as home improvement loans. While it’s not hard to imagine going into debt living in the DC metropolitan area, it is surprising to think that we may be investing our money more wisely than someone appointed to the highest judicial bench in the land.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brett Kavanaugh’s story unfortunately is not unique. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/heres-how-many-americans-have-nothing-at-all-in-savings.html\">According to a CNBC</a> article 35% of all adults in the U.S. have only several hundred dollars in their savings accounts and 34% of Americans have NO savings at all.  Even 40% of Baby Boomers are not ready for retirement. This shouldn’t be shocking when you look at the savings accounts (or lack thereof) for the vast majority of Americans. According to the EPI, nearly half of families have no retirement account savings at all, including IRAs and 401(k)s. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The median retirement account for U.S. families is just $5,000. Even older workers who can see retirement on the horizon aren&#8217;t prepared for it. The median savings for families whose wage earners are between 50 and 55 is only $8,000. For those who are between 56 and 61, it&#8217;s $17,000.  That’s not anywhere near enough money to get you through your golden years. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The good news is that this crisis can easily be rectified with self-discipline.  If you can commit to saving only 6% of your salary, or 3% with a match by your employer, you will be able to see the money add up over time.

The idea, of course, is that financial planners and wealth managers assist you in creating a road map for your money that helps you grow savings for lifestyle goals like retirement, purchasing a home, or sending your kids to the college of their dreams. The term “wealth management” often begs the question: What does “being wealthy” mean? And when do you need a financial planner to help you manage your wealth?</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Do People View Wealth?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-05-15/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-be-wealthy-in-america?__twitter_impression=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has shown that the definition of being wealthy rises as people age. Bloomberg states that Boomers tend to view $2.4 million as a requirement to be “wealthy” whereas millennial&#8217;s view wealth as a $2 million requirement. That’s a fairly large discrepancy &#8211; and it’s pretty clear what’s causing it. The younger we are, the more likely we are to view our financial future with a sense of optimism. We also tend to be more short-sighted in our financial planning, and believe that a smaller amount of wealth will last longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we age, we become more realistic about our finances. We start to see the big picture, and that honest truth is that we often need a lot more money than we realize. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Does Wealth Mean to You?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the discrepancy in what quantifies “wealth” among generations, one thing stays the same: people view wealth as several consistent things. They believe that wealth is:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freedom</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to stop worrying</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A secure future</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caring for yourself and your loved ones</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people also say that being wealthy equates to taking time for themselves in their daily life. According to the same survey, the majority of millennial&#8217;s believe that they will be wealthy in the future. However, the same optimism doesn’t translate to Boomers and other generations. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Importance of Saving</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to building wealth is saving a lot, and saving early. The sooner you can start to prioritize saving in your budget, the sooner you can begin to take advantage of compound interest. I’ve discussed this in <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/compound-interest-can-help-build-wealth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous blog posts</a>, but to review:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compound interest is essentially a snowball effect. As a snowball rolls down a hill, it grows in size. Even if you start with a small amount of money invested, it picks up more and more snow with each revolution. By the time you reach the bottom of the hill, the snowball has grown significantly, and will continue to grow faster the more you have invested. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This demonstrates the importance of saving early on in your financial life. Although many millennial&#8217;s feel positively about their opportunity for wealth, they won’t be able to capitalize on these goals if they don’t prepare now. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Importance of a Financial Plan</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This wealth study by Bloomberg also indicated that most people, unsurprisingly, felt more secure in their finances when they worked with a financial advisor on constructing their financial plan. Many millennials have yet to employ their own financial advisor, and it’s time to rethink that trend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth, many of my clients are millennial&#8217;s. I enjoy working with families and young professionals to both clearly define their goals and help them build a plan that moves them in the right direction. When advisers have the opportunity to work with millennial&#8217;s to grow their wealth, they have a leg up on pre-retirees who focus on financial planning as they near retirement: time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you implement a financial plan early in life, you have time on your side. With time, your wealth can grow significantly, and working with a financial adviser can help you make the right money moves early on to set yourself up for success in the long run.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are You Ready?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my recent video reviewing </span><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/money-milestones-this-is-how-your-finances-should-look-in-your-30s-2017-05-18\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MarketWatch’s article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on what you need saved for retirement by the time you’re 35 years old, I stressed the importance of saving early. It’s critical to start growing your wealth, even as a millennial who has many years until retirement, through targeted savings and a smart investing strategy. The critical thing to remember is you’re not just saving for retirement &#8211; you’re saving for all future goals like buying a house, sending your kids to college, or living well throughout your life. Saving is truly the only way to ensure wealth in your future, which means that saving is the only way to ensure options, freedom, and a lack of worrying about money as you age.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’d like to discuss your saving strategy, </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">schedule a consultation today</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Building a comprehensive financial plan that prioritizes saving while mitigating the impact of taxes and investment fees is key to growing your wealth and building a financial future you can rely on, and I’d love to help.</span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4814814814814814,"src":"/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/26a4d/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/4e5cc/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/5398f/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/26a4d/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/897d1/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/57238/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/b29c6/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"3307be1a-68d2-52c4-86c2-0be000861e16","slug":"entrepreneurs-and-investors-keeping-your-eye-on-the-endgame-pays-off","title":"Entrepreneurs and Investors: Keeping your eye on the endgame pays off","content":"<p>Let’s face it &#8211; we live in a world where people expect their needs will be met with instant gratification.  Social media, online shopping and the availability of having access to everything right at our fingertips means that consumers have high expectations that their needs will be met immediately without having to wait for what they want.  Unfortunately, these kind of short-term reward expectations can have drastic consequences for us both personally and professionally as well as for the economy overall.</p>\n<p>When we focus on the short-term gain instead of the long-term goals for ourselves or our businesses, we deprive ourselves of the full benefits (like all of the compound interest) that can come from patience and being self-disciplined when working toward our future goals and we wind up hurting the economy as well. <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/patient-investors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We recently wrote about the benefits of investing for the long-term</a> and in tribute to our beloved Washington Capitals and DC sports in general, patience pays off and success is the reward.

It continues to take a lot of patience and planning to grow my company into the vision I have for it long-term.  Along the way, I get positive reinforcement that this slow and steady strategy is paying off. In fact, I was just named one of the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/top-100-financial-advisors-2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 100 Financial Advisors by Investopedia</a> which certainly did not happen overnight.</p>\n<p>Building my company brick by brick and keeping my eye on the endgame is what allows me to successfully grow my company day by day.  What if all workers viewed their endgame instead of what they need immediately? Investing in the future is the only way to make sure your endgame is what you want it to be.  Resist the “I need it now” mentality that our culture pushes and shift your mindset to an endgame view.</p>\n<p>Instead of solely focusing on short term profits, companies should look more at their long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.  In <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-termism-is-harming-the-economy-1528336801\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article</a> by Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet, the pitfalls of what happens to the economy when looking only at the short-term is examined.  The compound interest that can be potentially generated from funds invested for the long-term is lost when companies are focused on the short-term fluctuations of the market. The article states that “Short-term-oriented capital markets have discouraged companies with a longer term view from going public at all, depriving the economy of innovation and opportunity. Fewer public companies has also meant fewer opportunities for retail investors to create wealth through their 401ks and individual retirement accounts.”</p>\n<p>What does your endgame look like?  Can you envision kids’ college tuition paid for, a beach house, summers off or traveling the globe?  It is never too late to change your mindset and your daily habits to achieve your dreams.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8858746492048644,"src":"/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/26a4d/caps-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/4e5cc/caps-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/5398f/caps-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/26a4d/caps-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/897d1/caps-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/57238/caps-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/7d505/caps-1.jpg 2016w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"5669e8bc-64c1-5491-a216-d7ed5f0291a4","slug":"patient-investors","title":"Patient Investors Come Out on Top","content":"<p>Many feel they don’t have the money they need to invest, so they forego savings altogether.

In the long run, your investments early on can make a real impact, and when the time comes to withdraw your hard earned savings, the interest you’ve earned on your investments will help to provide a comfortable retirement or any long term goal you might be saving towards.</p>\n<p><strong>Start Saving Now</strong></p>\n<p>Consider the difference of waiting to begin saving. At age 27 you will need to put away $214 a month to reach a goal of $1 million. When you start at age 37, you will need to put away $541 a month to reach your goal. If you wait until age 47, that number rises to $1,491 a month and if you wait until age 57, you’ll need to put away a hefty $5,168 a month. Waiting until the last minute (age 62) would mean having to stash $13,258 a month to reach $1 million by the age 67 &#8211; ouch!</p>\n<p>When you factor in things like compound interest, the negative impact of delaying your retirement savings becomes increasingly obvious. <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compound interest is often compared to a snowball.</a> If a 2-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny surface.</p>\n<p>As it keeps rolling, the snowball grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution. If you invest $1,000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2,158.93, in 20 years that will be $4,660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. It takes patience, but with time you can turn $1,000 into $21,724.52. That sounds like a lot of money, but if we’re being realistic, $1,000 is often spent on:</p>\n<p>• A weekend skiing with friends<br />\n• A few months of dining out with friends or your spouse<br />\n• A new piece of furniture, or tech that you may/may not need</p>\n<p>By hitting “pause” on these non-essential goals, you can easily start saving today and take advantage of compound interest.</p>\n<p>No matter where you are right now, the crucial point is to begin putting money aside immediately to achieve your long-term financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your future goals?</strong></p>\n<p>Travel? Education for your kids? Paying off your mortgage?</p>\n<p>Even when you contribute a minimal amount annually, if you’re consistent with that contribution over many years, the growth your investment will make can maximize your wealth in the long ron.</p>\n<p>The idea that you don’t have enough money right now to make your investment worthwhile is hurting you and your future. Resist the urge to overthink how much you are investing, and just act by giving what you can to your future savings today. Remember: every dollar counts, and the satisfaction of watching your investment grow over time will give you peace of mind and a freedom to plan for the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4322\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"921\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1.png 1200w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1-300x230.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1-1024x786.png 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-1-768x589.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Don’t Jump Ship When Things Go South</strong></p>\n<p>Many investors view themselves as being rationally-minded individuals who don’t take sudden action when the markets become turbulent. Too often, though, people do try to time the markets, and wind up making a wrong decision as a result.</p>\n<p>Derek Horstmeyer of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/impatient-investors-get-caught-in-the-return-gap-1525658940\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall Street Journal</a> writes &#8220;Most investors think of themselves as rational and immune from the behavioral elements that periodically roil markets. Human factors, however, do continue to affect our personal portfolio decisions—usually to the detriment of our long-run returns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thinking too much about the “perfect timing” when growing our portfolios is a strategy that will more often than not cause people to lose money in the long run. A far better investment plan is to focus on the big picture, and less on a perfect portfolio &#8211; where every decision is made at the exact right time.</p>\n<p>Timing the market is less important than time in the market, and getting caught up in getting that “perfect timing” is almost certain to cost you money. Aiming toward a good, solid return on your investment is a smarter strategy than worrying about every detail affecting your portfolio. All too often, people panic as soon as things start to go south (pulling out when the market has already hit bottom and putting in more when at the top). As a result, they often don’t experience this stated return in full. By resisting this urge to make a rash decision, investors showing behavioral restraint may actually wind up saving 1-2 percentage points a year.</p>\n<p>Starting early is a critical component to a successful portfolio. It is never too late (or too early) to start, so the sooner the better. Beginning in 2011, studies were conducted where participants were shown a computer generated rendering of what they might look like at their age of retirement. They were then asked to make financial decisions about whether to spend their money today or save that money for the future.</p>\n<p>In each study, those individuals who were shown pictures of their future selves allocated more than twice as much money towards their retirement accounts than those who did not see the age-progressed images. Seeing the images gave the participants a connection with their future selves that they did not possess before. As a result, their saving behavior changed dramatically because, “saving is like a choice between spending money today or giving it to a stranger years from now.”</p>\n<p><strong>Picture Your Retirement</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of viewing your future self as a stranger, think of how you actually might look. Then think of the financial decisions you are making today and how they will affect you in the future.</p>\n<p>Are your spending and saving habits today matching up with how well that future self is able to live tomorrow? Every delay you make toward saving for retirement, or investing wisely means a further burden you will place on yourself later on. In fact, starting your retirement saving early is actually more important than earning higher returns at a later date.</p>\n<p>The importance of starting now can’t be stressed enough. Luckily, fee-only, fiduciary advisors exist to help everyday people in making wise choices and to lessen the anxiety associated with what can seem like an overwhelming task.</p>\n<p>The good news is you don’t even have to be a millionaire to get this customized service. Working with a professional will enable you to maximize your return on investment and tailor a savings plan just for you. Don’t delay getting started. The benefits of starting early and often far outweigh how much you actually save.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8,"src":"/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/26a4d/patient-investors-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/4e5cc/patient-investors-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/5398f/patient-investors-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/26a4d/patient-investors-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/897d1/patient-investors-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/57238/patient-investors-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/e7e6d/patient-investors-1.jpg 864w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"7f9fea60-1d91-56c0-90ee-8a19da8f0af2","slug":"entrepreneurs-separate-biz-and-personal-finances","title":"Entrepreneurs: Separate Biz and Personal Finances","content":"<h5>This article appeared on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com\"><em>Investopedia.com</em></a> on May 17, 2018</h5>\n<p>As an entrepreneur, you would likely do anything to ensure your business is successful. For some, this means pouring a large portion of their money into their business. However, investing all of your time and money into your business can create an unhealthy financial balance in your life because in this situation, the success of your business will fully decide the success and growth of your personal wealth.</p>\n<p>Separating your business finances from your personal finances is hard and sometimes it’s impossible to keep the two fully isolated. The key is finding a way to grow your wealth independently of your business’s success, to reduce the risk you’re taking on. (For more, see: <em><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011816/financial-literacy-tools-small-business-owners.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Literacy Tools for Small Business Owners</a></em>.)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Build Your Personal Savings</h2>\n<p>Go into every business venture with your eyes open. Even if you have an airtight plan for profit, there’s a chance your business will experience some rough patches. To prevent this from negatively impacting your personal finances, start building your savings as soon as you can. If you haven’t started your business yet, you have some time to grow a cash savings that’s accessible to keep your personal finances in check in case of a emergency. Giving yourself several months worth of expenses is non-negotiable, and having a year or more is ideal.</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you’ve already launched your business, don’t panic. You can still prioritize saving in your current budget. To get started, set an attainable savings goal and design your budget to help reach it. Cut back on personal expenses to free up some cash flow to reach those goals.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Keep Business and Personal Expenses Low</h2>\n<p>If you’re just getting started, you’re probably already working to keep your business expenses as low as possible. This becomes harder to do as you start hitting your stride. As the money rolls in, you probably see an increase in a few things: your personal share of the profits, the amount of personal spending you do, the amount of business expenses you’re willing to take on, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<p>If your business is continuously successful, this might not seem like an issue. You’ve worked for the money, found success, and reinvested a large portion of that back into your business. However, if you keep increasing business expenses, you’ll have less wiggle room to protect your personal finances if things go south. (For more, see: <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/03/100803.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>401(k) Plans for the Small Business Owner</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>As you grow, your expenses will inevitably increase. Instead of trying to fight that, refocus to try and carefully evaluate every expense you take on. Shop around for less expensive options, or ask other business owners whether they have a similar expense, and how they’re handling it. You might find a creative solution that you hadn’t thought of before.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Avoid Distractions</h2>\n<p>We live in a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gig-economy.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gig economy</a> where “side hustles” are the latest and greatest financial pursuit. There’s nothing wrong with having a side hustle, but as an entrepreneur it doesn’t always make sense. Your business should be your number one priority. Rather than picking a lucrative side hustle that will take time away from your business, refocus that energy into finding other streams of revenue for your number one priority.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Find new ways to add value to the customers you already serve, get involved in a collaborative project with another professional that will direct business your way, and think outside of the box when growing your revenue, rather than finding a less-focused method of growing your income.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Get Smart About Investing</h2>\n<p>It’s tempting to have your business be your sole investment. Don’t fall into that trap. By having a diverse investment portfolio, you’re helping to ensure that your wealth is growing independent of your business. If you continually invest exclusively in your business, you’re increasing the amount of risk you take on.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a worst-case-scenario situation, your business goes under and you lose all of your money. To avoid that outcome, invest wisely, and in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversifiedfund.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diversified funds</a>.</p>\n<p>You may look at other professionals like doctors or lawyers who own their own practices and think, “Wow, they’re well educated, smart and successful.” We see them and assume they have it all together, and that their finances are in a better spot than ours. The truth is, they’re business owners just like you. Their businesses are equally at risk. There are no financial literacy courses at medical school.</p>\n<p>The good news is that you have the ability to take charge of your business and personal finances starting now. You can work to build savings, lower expenses and reduce the amount of risk you take on. If you make living a financially smart life a priority, you can make it happen.

Our 4 year old son is learning about savings by doing chores in return for an allowance, which he saves in his piggy bank. He is learning to save and spend his money wisely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents can begin educating their children at home in order to increase the financial literacy of their kids. By demonstrating wise financial habits, parents can serve as role models for their kids. Talking in an age appropriate way to your children about the dangers of debt and the importance of saving a portion of any money they earn instills financial values and lessons your child can use throughout life.  You may find that using an allowance is a way that you can teach your kids about saving and spending appropriately. Since it has been shown that kids who manage their own money have been found to demonstrate better financial habits in the future, giving your kids the opportunity to spend and save their own allowance or money earned is a good way to prepare them for later on. Even a simple trip to the store can be used as an opportunity to start the conversation about the danger of credit cards and how they should only be used in an emergency.  Educating your kids at an early age will enable them to better learn and practice sound financial habits while under your watchful eye and cause them to be less likely to make irrational decisions once they are out on their own. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4265 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-300x225.png 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-768x576.png 768w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1.png 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This issue is not only affecting students and young adults.  Many professionals with advanced degrees have spent countless hours studying and researching information in their particular field.  Despite all of the hours spent earning their degrees, many of these people have never taken a single course in financial education and are surprisingly not prepared to deal with the important financial decisions affecting their futures.  As a result, many extremely smart and successful people are making critical financial errors which can negatively impact the amount of money they have saved upon retirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in 2011, studies were conducted where participants were shown a computer generated rendering of what they might look like at their age of retirement.  They were then asked to make financial decisions about whether to spend their money today or save that money for the future. In each study, those individuals who were shown pictures of their future selves allocated more than twice as much money towards their retirement accounts than those who did not see the age-progressed images.  Seeing the images gave the participants a connection with their future selves that they did not possess before. As a result, their spending/saving behavior changed dramatically because “saving is like a choice between spending money today or giving it to a stranger years from now.”</span></p>\n<p>The benefits of educating your children about the importance of personal finances are undeniable, and you&#8217;ll be able to set them up for a promising future and help them prepare for retirement. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com\">Visit us online</a> for more information about how we can help improve your financial life.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.6666666666666667,"src":"/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/26a4d/piggy-bank-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/4e5cc/piggy-bank-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/5398f/piggy-bank-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/26a4d/piggy-bank-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/03203/piggy-bank-1.jpg 550w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}}]},"allPosts":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"news-resources","pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":33,"numberOfPages":5,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":"/news-resources/2","rootQuery":"\n  query PostsGridQuery($slug: String!, $skip: Int, $limit: Int, $filter: String) {\n    wordpressPage(slug: { eq: $slug }) {\n      title\n      slug\n      content\n      template\n    }\n    allWordpressPost(\n      limit: $limit,\n      skip: $skip,\n      filter: {\n        title: {\n          glob: $filter\n        }\n      }\n    ) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          id\n          slug\n          title\n          content\n          featured_media {\n            localFile {\n              childImageSharp {\n                fluid(maxWidth: 400){\n                  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    allPosts: allWordpressPost(filter: {\n      categories: {\n        elemMatch: {\n          slug:{\n            eq: $slug\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          id\n          slug\n          title\n          content\n          featured_media {\n            id\n            localFile {\n              childImageSharp {\n                fluid(maxWidth: 400){\n                  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n"}}}
