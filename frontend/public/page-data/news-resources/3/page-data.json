It’s a time we engage in self-reflection, ideas for self-improvement, and new – or ongoing – resolutions and goals.</p>\n<p>One of the most common resolutions is losing weight, but we all know how that goes: crowded gyms in early January, inevitable drop-off when February rolls around. In fact, a <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/\"><u>study</u></a> done by the University of Scranton shows that only about 8% of people actually achieve their resolutions.</p>\n<p>Financial resolutions often include starting – or finally sticking to &#8211; a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp\">budget</a>. Unfortunately, that resolution is all-too-often hard to stick to as well. (For related reading, see <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/newyear.asp\"><em>Financial New Year&#8217;s Resolutions You Can Keep</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Why do so many people have trouble sticking to their resolutions? One of the main reasons is having unrealistic expectations. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><u>Overconfidence</u></a> doesn’t just affect fitness goals, it affects investors’ behavior as well.</p>\n<p>How can you make this the year you stick to your goals?</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Take Baby Steps</h2>\n<p>Be reasonable in assessing where you are with your finances and don’t try to tackle everything at once. Start by listing all the areas of your financial situation you would like to improve. Then prioritize the individual elements in order of importance to you, and start by taking on one or two at a time. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/102516/achieve-your-financial-goals-financial-plan/\"><em>Achieve Your Financial Goals With a Financial Plan</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>If one of your goals is to start &#8211; and stick to &#8211; budgeting, don’t give yourself super-strict boundaries. Instead, start by creating good habits one at a time. If you want to pay off all of your <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp\">credit card debt</a>, for instance, take a look at how much debt you have and create a <u>realistic</u> weekly or monthly plan to start paying it off. If you want to buy a house in five years, you could decide to spend less now on something that you currently enjoy. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/091916/got-raise-heres-how-avoid-lifestyle-creep/\"><em>Got a Raise? Here’s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Focus on one or two goals at a time, see how it goes, and make progress – and adjustments – to stay on track.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Be Specific</h2>\n<p>Instead of saying “I am going to save more this year,” or “I am going to save $5,000 this year,” try to specify exactly how you plan to do it. Start with something like: “I will take $100 from each paycheck and put it into a savings account.” By giving yourself a tangible – achievable &#8211; steps, you’ll be better able to track how well you are sticking to it.</p>\n<p>In addition, try to think about what it is that you are trying to accomplish. Why do you want to save an extra $100 each paycheck? Are you saving up for a car? Trying to pay off debt? Building up an emergency fund? When you add purpose to your goals, it makes it more compelling and easier to accomplish. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/060816/why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><em>Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</em></a>)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Stay Accountable</h2>\n<p>Know yourself: accept who you are and what that means. Are you someone who might let things build up then feel too overwhelmed to jump back on track? Think about sharing your goals with a friend or family member and set times to check in with them and go over your progress. If you want to go to the gym three days a week, think about getting a workout partner. If you want to save an extra $100 from each paycheck, see if there is a friend that has the same goal and you can do it together, comparing how it’s going throughout the journey.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, understand that this is a process. Some weeks will be better than others, but, if you can follow these three steps – set realistic goals, set specific goals, be accountable &#8211; hopefully you will be part of the 8% that gets it done this year.

The basic concept of value investing is to buy investment instruments when they are “on sale.” That means buying when everyone else is selling (and prices are down) and vice versa. A bargain-hunting value investor looks for what they consider to be healthy companies that are – for whatever reason &#8211; severely undervalued. A smart value investor buys low, then patiently waits for the “herd” to catch up. Unfortunately, most investors tend to do the exact opposite. We tend to chase trends and follow the herd. (For more, see: <em><u>Don’t Let Emotions Hinder Your Investing Goals</u></em>.)</p>\n<h2>Sounds Easy. So Why is it Hard?</h2>\n<p>A huge part of smart investing is psychological and this chart illustrates of one of the many psychological roadblocks we have as investors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/the_problem_with_buy/bsherman_chart_timing.png\" /></p>\n<p>We may <em>want</em> to buy low and sell high, but that goes against <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">our instincts and biases</a>. When a stock is falling, we dump it. When a stock is rising, we buy it. We sell a company when the price is falling because we are afraid of losing more money; we buy a stock when it is rising because we have a fear of missing out. To compound the problem, most investors are not experts at realizing when something high or low “enough.”</p>\n<p>At times, investing can feel like quicksand: the more you do and the harder you try, the more you sink. It requires effort to overcome the psychological biases that often prevent us from acting in our own best interest. It is human nature, for instance, to continue to make the same mistake over and over again, or to not let go of stocks when we should through either familiarity bias or disposition effect.</p>\n<h2>Goals and Risk Tolerance</h2>\n<p>So what can you do to avoid to avoid the pitfalls of trying to buy low and sell high?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Understand your goals and risk tolerance: </strong>before you get started investing, it is critically important to understand what it is you are trying to accomplish and how much risk you are comfortable taking. Once you have that figured out, you can create an investment plan that is appropriate for you and comfortable enough to keep you from impulse buying high and panic selling low.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid market timing: </strong>instead of trying to time investments perfectly and squeeze every last cent out of each one, focus on building a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds that give you the greatest chance to succeed over the long term.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage your resources</strong>: having a great financial plan and a diversified portfolio is irrelevant if you don’t follow through and stick to it. Becoming self-aware of the pitfalls is a great first step. Having a good financial advisor is a good step too. Just make sure that they are a fee-only fiduciary, so that they have <em>your</em> best interests in mind at all times.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think about it: if it were easy &#8211; if everyone bought low and sold high &#8211; there would be <em>no</em> high or low because the market prices would be continually correcting. Bargains <em>do</em> exist and sometimes the wisest choice <em>is</em> to lock in earnings. The safest financial plan for the long run, however, is to understand your goals and risk tolerance, then work to create an investment plan that builds on gains over the long term, rather than continually outguess the market.</p>\n<p>(For more, see: <em><u>Which Investor Personality Best Describes You?</u></em>)</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/advisors/54337/brad-sherman/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

I know first hand: my mother was a public school teacher and a single mom. While some teachers may have other assets and savings they can draw on, a great number of teachers will rely on the retirement plans commonly used by teachers, known as 403(b) plans, as a source of income once they retire.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>This Is Money Teachers Will Need</h2>\n<p>In a recent series, The New York Times detailed many issues with the 403(b) plans so critical to a comfortable retirement for teachers. Their first piece, “<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-fees-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Think Your Retirement Plan Is Bad? Talk to a Teacher</a>” makes many of the same points we touched on previously in Teachers: Who is Managing Your 403(b)?</p>\n</div>\n<p>As the Times correctly points out: “Teachers in about a dozen states may not qualify for Social Security. And while public school teachers often are offered decent pensions, many of them do not work for the decades required to qualify for a full payout. And pension formulas are becoming less generous for newer recruits.”</p>\n<p>Unlike 401(k) plans that are overseen and regulated by federal law based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, many 403(b) plans fall outside of ERISA oversight and protection.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Who Can Teachers Trust?</h2>\n<p>Instead of having access to a financial advisor who is a <a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiduciary</a>, someone who exclusively &#8211; and always -must have the client’s best interests in mind, teachers are often presented with salespeople from insurance brokers who earn commissions for recommending certain products. As one teacher recounted in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-teachers-brokers-fees.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">part two</a> of the NYT series: “From the teacher’s standpoint, they really miss out getting quality advice,” said Mr. Bergeron, 27, who sold the plans for Axa Advisors’ retirement benefits group. “People who are in the schools pitching them and positioning themselves as retirement specialists are really there just to sell them one product.” (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/110816/investors-guide-new-fiduciary-rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An Investor&#8217;s Guide to the New Fiduciary Rule</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Fee-only fiduciary advisors are advisors who only recommend investments that are the best for their <em>clients</em>, not ones that reward themselves. Fiduciary financial advisors aren’t trying to hit a quota or working for sales commissions on the products they recommend to you. Fiduciaries are committed to providing the best advice to investors – like teachers &#8211; looking to build a strong foundation. These advisors grow <em>with</em> you, not at your expense by profiting off the products they recommend to you.</p>\n<p>Many of the millions of employees in this country have access to 401(k) plans through their employer that are approved and monitored by the employer in some way, ensuring at least some oversight of the plan itself. Unfortunately, public school teachers as well as some teachers working for nonprofits and religious institutions are easy prey for companies trying to sell high-cost products because their retirement plans often don’t have the same oversight. Given the loosely regulated industry, the insurance salespeople or “advisors” pitching to teachers can recommend investment products that best for their own pockets, not the plan owners’.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>The Costs and Confusion</h2>\n<p>While 401(k) plans are not perfect either, as <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">we have pointed out before</a>, the majority of them offer more traditional investment options, such as mutual funds or stocks and bonds, making it easier to understand how your money is invested. In contrast, 403(b) plans are often held inside annuities, which can be confusing even for the most intelligent individual investors. Discussing Axa Advisors, a broker that often tries to sell annuities, <em>The New York Times</em> writes: “The most popular version of the Equi-Vest annuity has a total annual cost that can range from 1.81 to 2.63%, according to an analysis from Morningstar. In contrast, large 401(k) plans usually charge an annual fee of less than half a percent of assets, according to a May report by BrightScope using 2013 data.”</p>\n<p>Even if teacher realizes that they are paying excessive costs for their retirement investments, they are often locked into these annuities and required to pay a penalty if they want to make changes. If a teacher wants to transfer their assets out of the Axa Equi-Vest annuity into their own IRA, for example, they would have to pay a 5% penalty on the portion of that withdrawal that had been contributed within the last six years.</p>\n<p>One of — if not the biggest — advantage of many retirement plans is tax deferral, which allows these accounts to grow and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">compound</a> over a long time horizon. That ability to grown and earn compound interest is obviously compromised when you are paying excessive fees year over year.</p>\n<p>Teachers are one of our most important assets and deserve to be rewarded for their years of dedication to our country’s children, and therefore our country’s future. All too frequently, however, teachers not given access to solid, low-cost and efficient long-term investment options in their retirement plans. Nor are they given access to a financial advisor they can turn to with questions, knowing that they can trust the answers they are given.</p>\n<p>We encourage teachers to spend some time finding out more about their 403(b) retirement fund managers. It’s vital to find out whether they are a fiduciary, how they make money (fee-based or fee-only), and how personalized their investment strategy is.  (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/111116/403b-plans-flaws-teachers-should-know/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

With a fully diversified asset allocation strategy, there will be parts of your portfolio that go up, as well as other parts that go down, during times of stress. That way you’ll be comfortable sticking to your investment strategy and plan through peaks and dips. Not only that, but you will have purchased those less volatile instruments before pundits start shouting and everyone starts panic-purchasing, driving the costs up.

It could be because the plan stops sending statements, or it could just be that you’re focusing on what’s going on in your life right now. There may even be a few you’ve lost track as the years pass.</p>\n<p>Consider too, that even if you have kept track of your old 401(k) accounts and know exactly what’s in each of them, you many not realize that you have other options besides just leaving the account and investments as is.

Your managers may be prioritizing the profits of their institution by investing your money in their own funds, even if that is not the best investment option for you. As <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\">John Oliver </a>recently demonstrated, these conflicts of interest can cost millions over the course of a single retirement plan’s life. Awareness is key. Make sure you look at old 401(k) statements from past employers to determine if they are being managed properly according to your needs and situation.</p>\n<h2>What Are Your Options?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<p>If you do determine that your 401(k) plan from a previous employer is not being managed properly, or as beneficially to you as it could be, the good news is that you have options. You can roll the funds into a new employer’s 401(k) plan or into an IRA account that you already hold. <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/071715/8-reasons-roll-over-your-401k-ira.asp\">Rolling over a 401(k) </a>into an IRA has potential benefits that could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower management and expense fees</li>\n<li>A wider range of investment options</li>\n<li>Consolidating multiple accounts into one retirement account</li>\n<li>The option to work with a fiduciary financial advisor with whom you are comfortable and whose recommendations are in your your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best interest at all times</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Can’t Find Your 401(k) Statement?</h2>\n<p>If you have lost track of an old 401(k) account, don’t worry, there are ways to search for it. Here are a few suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact your old employer’s HR department: if they can’t help you, they may be able to direct you to someone who can.</li>\n<li>Search <a href=\"https://www.unclaimedretirementbenefits.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The National Registry of Unclaimed Retirement Benefits</a> to see if your account is listed.</li>\n<li>Ask your financial advisor to help you track it down.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A well-managed 401(k) plan can be the gift that keeps on giving. But once you’ve left a company, take a good look at your plan and decide if it makes sense for you to leave the funds there, move them into a current plan, or move them into an IRA where you, and a Fee-Only fiduciary financial planner, can take advantage of a broader range of investment choices.</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/102116/options-your-401k-when-you-change-jobs/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Whether it’s career progress, a workout plan, or an investment portfolio, it’s exciting to see fast results. And it can be frustrating when progress doesn’t come quickly: when you’re not learning those guitar chords fast enough or your portfolio isn’t shooting ahead of the Dow.</p>\n<p>Achieving real progress and real gains usually takes time in spite of tantalizing offers to get rock-solid abs in seven days, learn to flip houses in two weeks, or a discover sure-fire stock that’s the next Apple.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Wanting to See Quick Results</h2>\n<p>It’s human nature to crave quick results but when it comes to investing, your emotions &#8211; or a desire for quick gratification &#8211; can get in your way of building a solid financial plan. (For more about Behavioral Finance, see: <em><a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051916/8-common-biases-impact-investment-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 Common Biases That Impact Investment Decisions</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/30/investing-is-a-fascinating-business.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> for The Motley Fool, columnist Morgan Housel made some excellent points about how we limit our chances of seeing real progress by letting our emotions get the best of us.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Frustration</h2>\n<p>“Most investing mistakes and frustrations come from trying to run a marathon in an hour,” Housel writes about the difference between short and long-term investing. “Companies earn profits, and over a long period of time those profits accrue to shareholders. If you leave it at that – and you should – investing is such a basic game that doesn’t require much action.” (For more, see <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/060816/why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>If we stuck to that game plan and utilized a long investment horizon to really take advantage of compound interest, the progress you would see would be impossible to ignore. Compound interest is a great way to look back and see the progress of your investments over a long time horizon. We <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summarize it like this</a>:</p>\n<p><em>Compound interest is often compared to a snowball. If a two-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny circumference. As it keeps rolling, its surface grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution. If you invest $1,000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2,158.93, in 20 years that will be $4,660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. All it takes is patience to turn $1,000 – the price of one ski weekend – into $21,724.52. </em></p>\n<p>A main problem many investors have is they fail to allow for this long time-horizon to play out. Housel&#8217;s next point builds on this when he says…</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Progress Happens Too Slowly to Notice</h2>\n<p>“Progress happens too slowly to notice; setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.” This ties into the idea of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">prospect theory</a> and Housel summarizes this concept well: “Pain hurts more than the same level of gain feels good.” This is similar to the concept of loss aversion where investors make emotional decisions that unfortunately lead to doing the exact opposite that one should do. Take 2008, for example, when the markets lost almost 40% in a short period of time. Those who made emotional decisions and exited the markets quickly not only locked in a significant loss but likely missed out on one of the biggest <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\">bull markets</a> in history as the market tripled over the next six years.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So much of this is human psychology. Having a dollar that stays a dollar doesn’t feel like you’re losing money. And losing a dollar often hurts more than gaining a dollar feels good. It’s like sports — losing a close game generally makes people feel lower than winning a close game makes you feel good. That’s what makes our job so interesting — working with people to park their psychology at the door, not just today, but forever. Not easy, but when done correctly you can really start seeing that elusive “progress” word come into play. (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/080116/why-playing-it-safe-could-hurt-your-retirement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Playing It Safe Could Hurt Your Retirement</a></em>.)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Avoiding Catastrophic Mistakes</h2>\n<p>“Most investing success boils down to avoiding catastrophic mistakes.” You don’t need to be the world&#8217;s greatest stock picker to benefit from investing. Far from it actually. As Housel puts it: “Few good decisions are needed to do well over time.” Instead, what we need to do is avoid making the catastrophic mistakes that typically come from making an emotional decision and not planning properly. Market corrections happen. They will happen again. Without proper planning, it is easy to fall victim to the pitfalls of prospect theory and end up making an emotional, short-term decision that can derail any progress that you have made.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To summarize, all of this boils down to a simple line of thinking. When it comes to investing, leave your emotions at the door. If you are uncomfortable with your investments, that is something you should take immediate action in. You may be invested in a portfolio that is too risky based on your goals, <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/embed/90260b609e67a973f2f0\">risk tolerance</a> and needs. You may just not fully understand how you are invested which makes you nervous. Worst of all, you may have no plan what so ever. Start by reevaluating your goals, short, mid and long term. Create a plan and road map to accomplish those goals, and then stick to it.

Here&#8217;s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep","content":"<p>We work with a lot of young professionals and because of that, we get the pleasure of seeing many of our clients progress up the ladder in their career. With this often comes more responsibility but also more money. A raise is something you should be proud of as it represents the payoff from the sacrifices you have made and the hard work you put in. This calls for a celebration, as it should!</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is crucial to make sure you don’t fall victim to the dreaded lifestyle creep, famously coined by financial planner <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/big-raises-and-lifestyle-creep-why-its-crucial-to-establish-good-spending-habits-early/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael Kitces.</a> The basic concept of lifestyle creep is that as your discretionary income goes up (you get a raise), your standard of living goes up with it. For example, before you stuck to a dining budget where you only ate out on weekends, but now you are doing so two times a week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/antoine-walker/\">We recently wrote about how a former NBA star filed for bankruptcy after earning more than $100 million on the court. </a>Read below on some tips to help you avoid some of these mistakes.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Why Lifestyle Creep Is a Problem</h2>\n<p>Living above your means is a recipe for financial trouble. We constantly preach that it’s not about how much you make, but how <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/savings/\">much you save</a>. By earning more money, you have the opportunity to save more. Take advantage of these opportunities by really thinking about what is a necessity vs. what is a luxury.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Read below on some tips to help you avoid some of these mistakes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Write down and revisit your goals</strong></li>\n<li>Maybe your goals have changed, maybe they haven&#8217;t. By revisiting them, remind yourself what is important to you and you can then make sure that is what you are spending your money on.</li>\n<li>One additional suggestion is to not make any purchases with the money you are receiving from your raise for the first month after receiving it. This gives you time to digest the news and will give you the ability to make more rational purchase decisions. If you still want to buy it after a month, then go for it.</li>\n<li><strong>Create and update your budget</strong></li>\n<li>If you don’t already have a budget, now is the perfect time to create one. If your boss gives you a $10,000 raise, that comes out to about $830 per month before taxes. With your goals in mind from tip No. 1, lay out all of your expenses and determine where the money should go each month. By having a set schedule, you reduce the urge to make impulse purchases because you see a large number in your checking account. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\"><em>The Conflicts of Interest Around 401(k)s.</em></a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Set up automatic saving account deductions</strong></li>\n<li>Now that you have a defined list of goals and a budget to help you achieve them, it is time to put the plan into action. There are numerous banks that we recommend to our clients that give you the ability to create multiple savings accounts to bucket your savings based on your goals. Create accounts for each of your goals and set up automatic transfers to these accounts from each paycheck you receive.</li>\n<li>In addition to your emergency fund account and other savings goals, make sure to give yourself a fun account that can be used to spend on celebrations such as getting a raise!</li>\n<li><strong>Increase or max out your retirement contribution</strong></li>\n<li>As part of your budget, look at how much you are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/playing-safe-hurt-retirement/\">contributing to your retirement account</a> each month. If you have the opportunity to increase your contribution, that is a great option to consider. If you have an employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">401(k)</a>, not only are you saving more for retirement, but you are also lowering your taxable income that just increased because of your raise. You may even qualify for an employer match, which makes these savings even greater!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After working so hard to get to where you are now, you should give yourself a chance to enjoy that success and celebrate. The important part is keeping an eye on the big picture and not letting your short-term emotions get in the way of achieving your true financial goals. By creating a plan that is realistic and one that you feel you can stick to, you dramatically increase your chances of success.

The end-of-summer teacher ritual of decorating, stapling and contacting parents has made its return. I know from personal experience, though, that teachers would be wise to use any spare time to investigate their retirement accounts and determine whether their money is being deployed as effectively as possible.</p>\n<p>My mom was a public school teacher and single mother. You can imagine how slim her finances were. Still, she managed to save up some money despite her paltry salary. After a while, however, she found out that the managers of her <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/403bplan.asp\">403(b) plan</a> were not investing her money as effectively as they should have been. A lot of her savings were tied up in a high-cost annuity that could have been invested in much cheaper options. These people, who were employed by the county to help her money grow, were actually eroding her savings.

Those words mean that a fiduciary will never do to clients what my mother’s managers did to her—we are legally obligated to act only in clients&#8217; best interests. Most schools will offer a 403(b) plan for teachers. However, as with the custodians of my mom’s savings, these plans can often be managed by a third party, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/donald-trump-takes-a-stand-on-401k-investments/\">non-fiduciary advisor </a>who may not act in clients&#8217; best interests.

In fact, the Indexed Annuity Leadership Council is one of the many groups suing the Department of Labor over its <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/repapering-your-account/\">new fiduciary rule</a>.

We aren’t looking for efficiencies or working for sales commissions on the products we recommend to you. Fiduciaries strive to provide the best advice to investors looking to build a strong foundation, like teachers. These advisors grow with you, not at your expense by profiting off the products assembled for you.</p>\n<p>Teachers, we encourage you to spend some time finding out more about the practices of your retirement fund manager.

FINRA recently released the results of its 2015 <a href=\"http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/downloads/NFCS_2015_Report_Natl_Findings.pdf\">survey</a>, which includes the fact that only 37% of those who took the survey could answer four of the five questions on a basic financial literacy quiz. Four out of five is FINRA’s baseline for high financial literacy. Back in 2009, 42% of the respondents were considered to meet this level of financial literacy. (If you’re curious, you can take the quiz <a href=\"http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/quiz.php\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>We’ve previously written about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">biases</a> in financial habits and the desolate state of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\">personal finance education</a> in high school and college, and this study re-confirms our suspicions. Way less than half of the American population has a sufficient understanding of the basic ideas necessary for successful saving and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-test-drive/\">financial planning</a>! That is nearing crisis levels.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake–an ignorance of personal finance, while probably unintentional, has serious consequences. Just over half of respondents said they are worried about running out of money in retirement, only one in five are willing to take risks when investing, and 57% say they set long-term financial goals. But, when taken together with those statistics, the most concerning part is that 76% have a high self-assessment of their financial literacy.</p>\n<p>As finance writer Jeff Sommer points out in his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/your-money/what-you-think-you-know-about-money-but-dont-can-hurt-you.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent column</a>, this means that Americans don’t know very much about personal finance and saving, but think they do. The positive self-perception is also the only figure to have significantly increased since 2009.</p>\n<p>Improving financial conditions can create a false sense of security for many savers who think their current status makes them recession-proof. This is a huge reason why I decided to start my own firm. I recognized the alarming lack of awareness about saving, spending and the markets, and noted many common bad habits that can lead to trouble in an economic downturn.

Traditional wealth management practices often have <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">high account minimums</a> that make their financial advice unreachable for most people. Moreover, even if you can open an account with a wealth manager, they may not be required by law to act in only <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/fiduciary-planner.asp\">your best interest</a>, which can lead to inefficient investments for you that pay them commissions.</p>\n<p>The reality is that many people are scared by the thought of investing. Since many Americans are mostly in the dark, they may not know where to go or how to start. That’s why it’s important to use online resources and educate yourself on all aspects of personal finance.

Full-time offers will be tendered, sighs of relief exhaled and paychecks cashed. Interns who receive offers will be bright-eyed with lofty visions of moonshot careers at their new place of employment. As these interns begin to accept the end of college and pivot towards the start of the rest of their lives, we strongly encourage them to start considering a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\">long-term financial plan.</a></p>\n<p>Sure, it is tempting to put most of your extra cash earned this summer in your checking account for drinks, trips to visit friends or to buy yourself something nice. The decidedly less glamorous option is to put a chunk of that cash into a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp\">Roth</a> or <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp\">Traditional individual retirement account</a> (IRA). But, almost certainly, that is the option for which your future self would pat you on the back. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\"><em>The Conflicts of Interest Around 401(k) Plans.</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Early Planning Is a Tough Sell</h2>\n<p>We know this is a tough sell for most college students. Salaries and long-term financial security aren&#8217;t big concerns for today’s generation as it has been before. Even on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wallstreet.asp\">Wall Street</a>, where compensation is high, interns seek other qualities in a company. For example, interns at investment bank Jefferies <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-interns-write-monthly-memo-000000295.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said they valued </a>relatable leadership, a family atmosphere and inclusion. So we get that saving for retirement may not be where your mind is at—especially if you received an offer and want to celebrate. (Which, by all means, you should.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>We aren’t here to suggest you start living a life of austerity now that college is almost over. But you must consider that right now is the best time in your life to put a bit of money away for retirement. The <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">power of compound interest</a> means that the earlier you start saving, the greater your returns will be. It doesn’t matter how small the amount—money invested in the stock market can grow exponentially over time because it compounds year over year.</p>\n<p>In our experience, many college-aged people <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">don’t know where to start</a>, even if they are interested in opening an IRA. The choice between, for example, a Roth or Traditional IRA can be opaque and intimidating. And then, once an account has been opened, where do you actually invest the money? How can it be monitored? (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\"><em>6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>To pile on top of that, as you graduate and find a new pad, start work and are presented with options for employer-sponsored retirement plans, you might be forced to consider trade-offs. Should you work on paying off your student loans or invest that money into growing your retirement account? Or, you might ask yourself, why invest at all when I can just keep my earnings in cash?</p>\n<p>All of this “adulting” can be overwhelming, and unfortunately often leads to poor financial decisions. (For some guidance, we highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Oliver’s take on saving and financial advice</a>.) But one thing you can be confident of is that starting to save now has almost no downside. If you aren’t totally sure of your ability to open an account and invest on your own, follow John Oliver’s advice and contact a low-cost, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">fiduciary financial advisor</a> who can work with you to grow your investment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that putting a chunk of your income towards retirement at such a young age isn’t sexy. But it has enormous benefit and will set you on a path of financial wellness. It’s the right thing to do.

He has made so many newsworthy remarks that it is hard to keep up. One day last week was <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-gop-trump-go-unraveling-break-glass-mode-n622116\">particularly</a> impressive as he made over 10 news-making assertions in under 24 hours. These included initially refusing to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan, doubling down on his feud with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan and predicting that the election will be rigged. (For more, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">The Conflicts of Interest Around 401(k)s.</a>)</p>\n<p>Whether you support him or not, simply finding the time in the day to make all those remarks (and more) is impressive. But there was one opinion in particular that caught our eye, via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/760475701317427200\">CBS’s Sopan Deb.</a> Trump made the below statements during an interview with FOX Business Network&#8217;s Stuart Varney:</p>\n<p><strong>Varney:</strong> For the the small investor, the average guy, right now, would you say, yes, put your 401(k) money into stocks?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong> No, I don’t like a lot of things that I see. I don’t like a lot of the signs that I’m seeing. I don’t like what’s happening with immigration policies. I don’t like the fact that we’re moving tremendous numbers of people from Syria are coming into this country and we don’t even know it. Thousands of people, thousands and thousands of people. There’s so many things that I just don’t like what I’m seeing. I don’t like what I’m seeing at all. Look, interest rates are artificially low. If interest rates ever seek a natural level, which obviously would be much higher than they are right now, you have some very scary scenarios out there. The only reason the stock market is where it is—is because you get free money.</p>\n<h3>Trump&#8217;s Approach</h3>\n<p>Even if you are his number one fan, please don’t hire Donald Trump to manage your 401(k). First of all, setting aside the economic truth of what Trump is saying and whether his fears will ultimately influence the market as much as he thinks, every factor that he mentions in his response is short-term. As Trump is 70 years old, focusing on what’s coming immediately down the line is understandable. But most investors have longer to go until retirement and therefore need to be invested in the stock market’s long-term gains, particularly those investors without Trump’s level of wealth. (For more, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/playing-safe-hurt-retirement/\">Why Playing It Safe Could Hurt Your Retirement.</a>)</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-02/donald-trump-your-401-k-adviser\">Bloomberg points out</a>, Trump’s strategy basically amounts to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\">timing the market</a>. We believe that in the long run, due to the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">efficient market hypothesis</a>, you can’t beat the returns of the market through individual stock selection and market timing. Therefore, the safest thing to do is to stick with the market, while of course monitoring constantly and rebalancing.</p>\n<p>Trump’s approach could be a recipe for long-term disaster. Fidelity Investments has compared how investors who pulled out of the market near its bottom in 2008-09 fared versus those who stayed. Those investors who stuck with the market ended 2015 $82,000 richer than those who withdrew, on average. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\">Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</a>)</p>\n<p>So even if Trump is completely correct, it is not a good strategy for a long-term retirement saver, which is the demographic he was asked about. If Donald Trump applied his advice to your 401(k), you’d probably do worse than if you ignored him, even in the case of a market correction.</p>\n<p>Asked about alternatives to the stock market, Trump would likely point to real estate (<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/donald-trump-and-the-benefit-of-financial-foresight/\">we wrote about that here</a>), which is where most of his dealings have been. The answer is somewhere in between a diversified portfolio with investments in real estate (if you can afford it), but also stocks, bonds, the money market, etc. If a market correction really is coming as Trump predicts, then the best hedge against it isn’t to pull all your money out of equities. Rather, for most savers, we think the best protections are a long-term financial plan and a diversified portfolio, both of which account for short-term market volatility.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/080916/donald-trump-takes-stand-401k-investments/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

In answering what was the best way to invest money unneeded for at least 10 years, real estate (25%) and cash (23%) took the top spots, followed by the stock market and gold (16% each) in a tie for third. This comes on the heels of Bank of America finding that <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/19/investor-cash-levels-highest-in-15-years-according-to-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-survey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash levels in portfolios are at their highest since November 2001</a>.</p>\n<p>In a time of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/\">volatility</a> in the market, many Americans, particularly those who are young and/or without a huge amount of money to invest, are hesitant. They prefer the certainty of a house or even cash under the mattress to the unpredictability and seeming inaccessibility of the public markets. On the surface, this <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fear-keeps-millennials-investing-sidelines/\">seems like the safer option</a>, and we understand why many people feel this way. Loss aversion is countered by having a tangible stack of cash that will always be there.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s wrong and can be dangerous in the long term.</p>\n<p>What many cash-focused savers don’t realize is that because of <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a>, the value of cash fluctuates over time—just like a stock. As Alex Gurevich, CIO of HonTE Investments, points out, that means that <a href=\"http://alexgurevich.tumblr.com/post/147567467957/journey-of-cash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash is subject to bubbles</a> similar to tech in 2000 or the mortgage crisis. Moreover, saving only cash eliminates access to the market’s long-term returns; $10,000 invested in the <a href=\"http://alexgurevich.tumblr.com/post/147567467957/journey-of-cash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&amp;P 500</a> in 1980 <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">would yield</a> $166,600 at year-end 2015, adjusted for inflation. Even with the ups and downs, in the long run the stock market remains the best place to invest for retirement. (For related reading, see: <em>Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy</em>)</p>\n<p>Saving cash is still important for short-term emergency funds. But if simply stockpiling cash is your long-term plan for retirement, you probably have no shot unless you’re very wealthy.</p>\n<p>Many people may avoid the stock market out of a fear of the bad days when the market tumbles. Some people panic when the market dips (for example, in the event of a major world <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/instituting-investing-rules-lessons-from-the-brexit/\">event like Brexit</a>) and sell most or even all of their stock. Besides the fallacy of panic-selling at play here (you’d be selling low rather than buying low and selling high), by withdrawing from the stock market you miss out on the good days as the price of shielding yourself from the bad. Reporter Spencer Jakab <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-youre-a-lousy-investor-and-dont-even-know-it-1468266957\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">points out</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journa</em>l that a couple good days a year produce the entire year’s returns, on average. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\"><em>Behavioral Finance: 8 Common Investor Biases That Impact Investment Decisions</em></a>)</p>\n<p>“Investors sit out on some really good days by trying to avoid bad ones,” Jakab writes. “Nearly all of those happen around scary episodes such as October 1929, October 1987 and in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Pretend, for example, that you took your money out of the market following the choppiest episodes over the last 20 years and wound up missing the epic rebounds that made up the 40 best days. You actually would lose money.”</p>\n<p>The stock market can be threatening and, sometimes, punishing. But the solution isn’t total withdrawal; on the contrary, find an advisor you trust and create a plan that makes you more comfortable about investing. As Ben Carlson <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2016/06/you-have-to-invest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes</a>, “The alternative for stepping out into the unknown is the known of never building your wealth.”</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/080116/why-playing-it-safe-could-hurt-your-retirement/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Because your investment returns are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">compounded</a>, the earlier you start investing the more — and longer — will the returns add up, ultimately leaving you with more money in the bank.</p>\n<p>So what are millennials waiting for? Many of the concerns holding them back from the market boil down to a lack of information about investing. Some of the most common fears are:</p>\n<h3>‘I have no idea where to start’</h3>\n<p>Many potential young investors have <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no idea where to start</a> even if they wanted to buy just one stock. And then they don’t know how to choose which stock or fund to invest in. Since most people don’t get personal finance education as part of their schooling, investing can seem enormously daunting and precarious.</p>\n<p>A little online research can demystify many of the basic investing concepts, such as how compounded interest works, how patience can be beneficial, and how to not overreact to temporary dips in the market. Working with a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-test-drive/\">financial advisor to develop a plan</a> and ease into an investing strategy also can help reduce your stress and anxiety about entering the stock market.</p>\n<h3>‘I haven’t even paid off my loans — I can’t start saving’</h3>\n<p>Concern about debt, particularly student loans, is understandable and widespread among millennials. Student loan borrowers have an <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/employer-benefit-student-loans/\">average debt of almost $30,000</a> for undergraduate loans. The question of whether to pay off student loan debt more aggressively or use the extra money to start saving is a tough one because people don’t have the same financial situations. Your debt, cash flow and spending circumstances are unique and will require a plan that’s customized to you.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, however, that your years as a young professional are your prime saving period. If you can stomach not using all your extra money to pay off loans, you could reap the long-term benefit of investing early. Paying down a high-interest loan is a priority. But if the interest is low enough, consider creating a financial plan that allots some of your savings to an IRA or 401(k). Over time, the return on that investment, with the help of compounded interest, can make the trade-off worthwhile.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have high-interest loans, creating a long-term, comprehensive financial plan that includes saving and investing is the best way of making sure you’ll have the funds you’ll need in the future, whether it’s to pay down debt, buy or rent a house, or make any other important expenditure. If you live on a tight budget, controlling and mapping out your spending becomes even more important.</p>\n<h3>‘I don’t trust, or can’t afford, financial advisors’</h3>\n<p>Many advisors require high asset minimums that may be well out of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\">reach for young investors</a>. And even then, the advisor could put your money in inefficient investment products that could generate commissions and other hidden fees for the advisor and inflate your investing costs.</p>\n<p>Many advisors are not legally obligated to act only in their clients’ best interest; they merely have to suggest “suitable” investments. In many cases this means investments for which they are paid a commission. But those who uphold the fiduciary standard are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\">required to put their clients’ interests first</a>. And fee-only advisors are paid solely for the advice they give you, and not through commissions on the products they recommend.</p>\n<p>Millennials are right to be wary of the industry, but there are advisors who won’t put their profit goals ahead of yours. Look for a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">fee-only fiduciary advisor</a>. You may also want to work initially with a fiduciary advisor who charges by the hour if advisors with asset-management minimums are out of reach.</p>\n<p>You need a financial plan that’s customized for your own situation and goals. But that doesn’t mean you can afford a delayed start. The sooner you map out a financial plan and start saving and investing, the bigger the payoff will be down the road.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/millennials-fear-investing/\">Nerdwallet.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

More specifically, the 2,500 funds surveyed were less likely to eliminate underperforming funds that were their own rather than another provider’s fund. This can be very costly to retirement savers. Clemens Sialm, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the study’s authors, explained that the bottom 10% of funds continued to underperform by about 4% if kept on the menu of funds available to investors.</p>\n<p>With all of the attention lately focused on reducing these <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">conflicts of interest</a> where financial managers invest your money in their own funds (among individual financial advisors rather than institutional), it is surprising to see the bias getting coverage on an institutional level. As of June 2015, $4.7 trillion were invested in 401(k) accounts, plus another $2.1 trillion in non-401(k) defined-contribution plans. As John Oliver<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\"> recently detailed</a>, these conflicts of interest can cost millions over the course of a single retirement plan’s life. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/antoine-walker/\">Financial Failings of NBA Legend Antoine Walker</a>.)</p>\n<h3>Why the Conflicts Exist</h3>\n<p>The reason for the existence of these conflicts of interest is simple. Managers are prioritizing the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">profits of their institution</a> over the success of the retirement plans they oversee. And there is no question that it is a raw deal for the investor. We’ve previously covered how many actively managed funds don’t even beat the market in the first place, and this study confirms that failing funds aren’t even taken off the menu of options. Imagine if your local restaurant kept undercooking their chicken and everyone was getting sick, but they refused to change the recipe.<br />\nMany employees at big asset management firms are now <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2016/07/06/how-dare-you-make-us-eat-our-own-cooking/\">suing their own companies</a> to liberate their own retirement plans from management. These people know it’s a scam, and God forbid that their own money gets caught up in it, but by and large they are OK with selling you inefficient funds. (For related reading, see: 6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor and Do You Need to Change Your Financial Advisor?)</p>\n<p>These current events—and the study—indicate that conflicts of interest are pervasive in all aspects of the retirement planning industry, whether it’s a 401(k) through your employer or via traditional financial advisors. Dealing with this reality requires vigilance on your part. To return to the analogy of the undercooked chicken, it would be an easy case to deal with since everyone could tell that the chicken was making them sick. But what allows traditional asset companies to get away with conflicts of interest is that many people are simply too busy to monitor their accounts—that is, to find out if they are sick or not. If the undercooked chicken gave you an illness that was hard to detect, it would be much easier for the restaurant to get away with it.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the tide is beginning to turn, and you can impact change, even with your 401(k). You should become an advocate for your own money. Contact your HR department and ask to see the performance of the menu of funds. See <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\">who’s managing it</a>, how the menu has changed and evaluate the extent of conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, independent, conflict-free advice and management is the best cure for the industry’s problem.

A big man who also shot the three, Walker was notorious for his hilariously erratic shot selection and, later in his career, an aversion to running that led to lazy play.</p>\n<p>The quality of financial advice Walker received throughout his career was evidently very close to the quality of his shot attempts, as he <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/24/investing/antoine-walker-nba-bankruptcy/\">filed for bankruptcy</a> in 2010, two years after he retired from the game. In a recent column in the <a href=\"http://www.theplayerstribune.com/2016-6-28-antoine-walker-nba-letter-to-my-younger-self/\">Players’ Tribune</a>, Walker writes a letter to his younger self detailing what went wrong and what he could have done better.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, there are a few money management lessons that anyone—NBA star or not—can apply. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\">Do You Need to Change Your Financial Advisor</a>?)</p>\n<p><strong>Actively Screen Advisors<br />\n</strong>Screen advisors before you hire them, and after you do, make sure you know where your money is going. Walker frames his letter with the importance and difficulty of saying “no,” whether to friends asking for money or, most crucially, a friend of a friend who asked for money to start a real estate venture.</p>\n<p>The advisor, who Walker met at a dinner with NBA colleagues, started Walker Ventures with bank loans guaranteed by Walker’s personal portfolio, an incredibly risky move. Walker let the advisor have complete control of managing the properties since he was playing basketball nine months of the year. Ultimately, Walker Ventures was forced to close after the housing crash with $20 million of debt. The advisor went to jail, and Walker was forced to file for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>There were a couple ways this could have been prevented. First, Walker didn’t do much due diligence before making the deal. He could have run it by another advisor, who probably would have told him it was structured as an extremely risky venture. Second, because of his schedule, Walker did not adequately check up on the investments.</p>\n<p>Many people, particularly young investors, share Walker’s desire to make some money outside of their main job, especially to save for retirement. Finding a financial advisor who is trustworthy, and right for your unique needs, is very important. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor.</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>The Upside of Having Someone Say No<br />\n</strong>Walker’s trouble with the real estate venture was compounded by his reckless spending. While he confesses that he spent lavishly on himself, including a $350,000 Maybach car, it appears that what took the biggest bite out of Walker’s wallet was his spending on family and friends. &#8220;I gave them whatever they wanted and spoiled them. You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Walker said in a CNN/Money interview. &#8220;It ended up being an open ATM throughout my career.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While most of us don’t take our friends to a Gucci store and let them buy whatever they want—as Walker has said he did—spending without at least an idea of what is manageable is a problem many people encounter. For <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\">young professionals in particular</a>, overspending can seriously hinder retirement saving.</p>\n<p>A good financial advisor will do more than simply invest your money. They will incorporate periodic spending goals, major expenditures like vacations, and life events like a new home or wedding into your comprehensive financial plan. Sometimes, this could mean advising against a big purchase for the sake of a long-term goal.</p>\n<p>Obviously, we don’t all have $110 million to blow like Antoine Walker. But lackadaisical spending control and being too busy to check on our investments or advisors are traps anyone could fall into. Ensuring that your money is in the right hands is a universally important objective.

As this <a href=\"http://advisorhub.com/dol-fiduciary-rule-may-hit-advisor-pay-raymond-james-ceo/\">AdvisorHub article</a> points out, &#8220;brokers who are heavily concentrated in retirement accounts may delay moving until they determine if they will have to “repaper” commission accounts into fee-paying accounts because of the rule.&#8221; Paul Reilly, CEO of traditional financial advisory company Raymond James, <a href=\"http://advisorhub.com/dol-fiduciary-rule-may-hit-advisor-pay-raymond-james-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a> that &#8220;Raymond James itself is looking closely at each prospect’s book to determine how much it is flavored by IRA accounts that could become less profitable.&#8221; During the campaign against the DoL rule, Reilly <a href=\"http://www.onwallstreet.com/news/raymond-james-ceo-calls-on-advisors-to-fight-dol-fiduciary-definition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">encouraged Raymond James employees</a> to help oppose the  DoL&#8217;s fiduciary proposal.

According to the article, 81% of advisors surveyed said they used or recommended ETFs to their clients in 2015. We have been advocating ETFs as a secure, flexible investment for our clients since the days when they weren’t as popular.</p>\n<p>Here’s a look at some ETF basics. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><em>Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>What Are ETFs?</h2>\n<p>An ETF combines features of stocks and mutual funds. Like a mutual fund, it is composed of a group of stocks, giving investors access to a diverse array of securities with only one transaction, an investment in the fund. And like stocks, an ETF can be bought or sold on the open market at market-determined prices. ETFs are usually used to track specific indexes of the securities market as a whole or of specific sectors. The first ETF in 1993 was created to track and match the performance of the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp?ad=dirN&amp;qo=investopediaSiteSearch&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=40186\">S&amp;P 500 index</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Why Do We Use Them?</h2>\n<p>ETFs have a number of advantages for investors who are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\">saving for retirement</a>. These include:</p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> While the holdings of a regular mutual fund are only reported every quarter or year, ETFs report their holdings every day since they are traded and the holdings are a reflection of an index. Knowing exactly which positions you are invested in can help with fine-tuning your portfolio according to your <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/embed/90260b609e67a973f2f0\">risk tolerance</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower costs:</strong> The passive nature of ETFs allows them to have significantly lower costs than a mutual fund. In short, actively managed funds, as the name implies, execute a far greater number of trades than passive funds like ETFs, which are generally not overseen by a fund manager on a daily basis. As a result, ETFs usually incur much lower costs than actively managed funds. (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\">Don’t Expect to Win With Actively Managed Funds</a>.</em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Mutual funds, whether active or passive, can only be sold at the end of the trading day. On the other hand, ETFs are traded throughout the day and their price continually updated.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax efficiency:</strong> There are several factors underlying the structure and operations of ETFs that make them more efficient than a lot of mutual funds. To buy shares of a mutual fund, you must exchange cash for shares directly with the fund. There is no middleman; therefore, when the fund realizes capital gains on an investment, those gains are passed through to the individual investors and you must pay tax on it. When purchasing shares of an ETF, the shares in the ETF are purchased through a middleman called an Authorized Participant, not the fund itself. (The AP purchases shares from the fund when they are originally issued.) This degree of removal from the fund and the capital gains it realizes can help you avoid significant taxes on long-term capital gains. Additionally, since ETFs don’t make as many trades as actively-managed funds, there are fewer chances for an event that could generate capital gains, which will be taxed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how do they fit with our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">investment strategy</a>? We think that your best chance at building wealth through the markets for retirement is to work with a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/?ad=dirN&amp;qo=investopediaSiteSearch&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=40186\">fiduciary advisor</a> to utilize a long-term approach that emphasizes diversification, tax efficiency, risk management and cost effectiveness. We believe in the efficient market hypothesis, which dictates that in the long run, it is nearly impossible to beat the returns of the market by picking individual stocks and market timing. Therefore, an ETF is generally a stable—but flexible—tool for long-term growth if used properly.

Of course, investors and advisors should have <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basic philosophies</a> that they stick to, even in times of market crashes, such as not following the herd and selling off when a stock is lowest.

That’s what rule-based investing is. It takes out one of the challenges I’ve found as an investor over the decades.”</p>\n<p>In other words, you have to eliminate emotion from your investing. As a retirement saver, this can be incredibly difficult after big market swings, whether up or down. We’ve <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previously explained why active management doesn’t win</a> and one of the benefits of passive investment management is that since it takes a long-term view, it reduces the role of emotion in investment decisions. Creating investing rules can be a good extension of this strategy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/070616/instituting-investing-rules-lessons-brexit/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

It’s not many of us. We smile at each other. But how many honest? Trust issues.” West wonders whether those around him are there because they really have his best interests at heart, or if they only care about him for his money.</p>\n<p>Given recent developments in the financial advisory industry, many Millennials might be wondering the same thing about their financial advisor. The Department of Labor (DOL) will soon be enacting a new rule that requires all financial advisors handling a retirement account to abide by a fiduciary standard, which means always acting in the best interests of the client and not the advisor’s or corporation’s profits. It might be surprising, but that is currently not always the case. If your advisor is not a fiduciary, he or she may not be obligated to act only in your best interest. You can read more about the new rule and our take on the fiduciary obligation <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Opponents of the rule, unsurprisingly the financial services industry’s lobbyists, who largely oppose the rule, point to a study saying that <a href=\"http://m.wealthmanagement.com/industry/report-dol-rule-may-force-advisors-abandon-small-investors?NL=WM-27&amp;Issue=WM-27_20160618_WM-27_55&amp;sfvc4enews=42&amp;cl=article_1_2&amp;utm_rid=CPG09000003982919&amp;utm_campaign=6329&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;elq2=8e29b8ece7c644bfa8ff682effdaff1b\">it will decrease access</a> to financial advice for small investors since advisors “cannot figure out how to make money when working with them.” Without the fiduciary obligation, how do advisors currently profit from younger investors? Forbes recently published <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganstanley/2016/06/06/the-millennials-guide-to-a-sweet-retirement/?sr_source=lift_facebook&amp;nowelcome&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=morganstanley#624a74135837\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an article</a> by the Morgan Stanley team where advisor T. Gregory Naples says that with Millennial clients he,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“starts them out in managed mutual funds until they reach $50,000. After that, he often switches them to more transparent and lower-cost stock and bond funds managed by institutional money managers.”</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Breaking it Down</h2>\n<p>This is a huge admission. Let’s break down exactly what Naples is saying. Crucially, Naples admits that, until you hit $50,000 <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp?o=40186&amp;l=dir&amp;qsrc=1&amp;qo=serpSearchTopBox&amp;ap=investopedia.com\">assets under management</a> (AUM), he invests your money in more expensive, less efficient funds. Many of these “actively managed” funds, which try to beat the market’s returns, have higher costs because of labor and number of trades they execute. After this period, once your AUM gets to a point where Naples can more easily make money off of you through fees, he puts your money into more efficient places it should have been all along.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Later on, he mentions examples illustrating the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">compound interest</a>, but neglects to mention that the unnecessary fees you are incurring from the inefficient funds he has invested your money into will eat away at the returns you get from the compound interest. This illustrates the folly of the argument that the fiduciary rule will drive young investors away. Young investors who are just starting out are, in fact, much better off being driven away from advisors with non-fiduciary practices like Naples. Entrusting your money to a non-fiduciary, traditional financial advisor as a young, new investor is like intentionally hitchhiking on a road known for having murderous truck drivers when there’s a much safer road nearby. (Read more about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">6 Questions to Ask A Financial Advisor</a>)</p>\n<p>People naturally gravitate towards big firms with name recognition. But as the Naples quote demonstrates, these large, non-fiduciary firms may not always be the best option, particularly for young investors. What the back-and-forth over the DOL rule reveals is that non-fiduciary advisors often don’t even really want your money. Most seek accounts with higher balances. So <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">why go where your money is not wanted?</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/062916/do-you-need-change-your-financial-advisor/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Bad habits — whether it’s biting our nails, overeating, smoking or something else — create roadblocks on the path to becoming our best selves.</p>\n<p>And it’s no different when it comes to our finances. Bad money habits can have damaging, long-term consequences for our financial security. But developing healthy financial habits can do wonders for helping us achieve our long-term goals like <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">saving enough for retirement</a> or paying for a child’s college education.</p>\n<p>The earlier you develop healthy financial habits, the better your chances of successfully meeting your goals. Here are four financial habits you should start working on today:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Separate spending on ‘needs’ and ‘wants’</strong></h3>\n<p>This is the first step in developing healthy habits. You need to understand where your money is going and then figure out where you need to allocate it to make the best use of it.</p>\n<p>Sticking to a spending plan and avoiding impulse buying is crucial for building a healthy savings plan. Create a simple budget that shows you how much money you are bringing in and helps you understand your monthly spending. Add up all of your expenses that you would consider a need — this includes your monthly savings amount, rent, car payment, cable and internet bill, food, etc. (By including your savings amount in your need category, you create an automatic savings plan for yourself — more on that below.) Subtract that total from your income, and what is left over is your free <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">cash flow</a>.</p>\n<p>The remaining money is the amount you have at your disposal for your “want” expenses. At the very least, make sure you are not spending more than that. At the end of the month, if you still have money left over, stick it in your savings or investment account. This removes the temptation to spend it and lets you start the next month fresh again. If you consistently have money left over, increase your savings amount.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Set up automatic savings</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating a consistent savings mechanism will ensure you are saving a minimum amount each month or paycheck, making progress toward your longer-term goals. Whether you are saving into an investment account or your bank savings account, set up an automatic contribution from each of your paychecks so that the money is “out of sight, out of mind” and you won’t be tempted to spend it.</p>\n<p>Why is this so important? Without having an automatic savings plan, you could be saving $500 one month and then $0 the next. Although this is better than not saving at all, it is not a good practice to adopt. And remember, you can start small. Even if it’s $100 a month, saving consistently will pay off immensely down the road.<em> </em></p>\n<h3><strong>3. Participate in your employer-sponsored retirement plan</strong></h3>\n<p>Saving for retirement is one of the most important financial habits you can build for yourself. The power of tax-deferred investment growth over your entire career can really add up. Another benefit with 401(k)s and other retirement plans is that the money you contribute is pretax, which effectively lowers your taxable income, reducing your tax liability today.</p>\n<p>If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k) based on your contribution level, it’s especially important to contribute enough to take advantage of this benefit. The employer is basically offering you free money that you would be turning down. For instance, an employer may offer a retirement savings plan to which you can contribute up to 5% of your salary and it will match up to 3% of that. If you don’t contribute at least 3%, you are in effect saying no to a 3% raise.</p>\n<p>If your employer does not offer a retirement savings plan, look into opening a self-directed retirement account such as an IRA so you can benefit from tax-advantaged retirement saving.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Start investing now</strong></h3>\n<p>Time is the greatest advantage investors have when it comes to saving and investing early and consistently. With the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">compound interest</a>, even small amounts can really add up over the years. With compound interest, your interest amount is added to the principal, increasing the amount of interest you earn, even if the rate of return does not change. To take advantage of compound interest, the earlier you start saving, the better.</p>\n<p>If you can boost your savings rate, you’ll be even better off in the event of a long period of low investment returns, according to Michael Batnick, director of research for investment firm Ritholtz Wealth Management. “<a href=\"http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2016/05/19/how-to-stack-the-odds-in-your-favor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Saving more money can offset lower returns </a>because you’re compounding on top of compounding,” Batnick writes. He points to a comparison of two portfolios over a 20-year period, both starting with contributions of $5,000 a year. The portfolio earning an average of 4% annually, with contributions increased by 10% each year, will have $100,000 more in it compared with a portfolio earning 6% a year, with contributions raised by only 5% ($393,153 vs. $293,534).</p>\n<h3>Prioritize your goals</h3>\n<p>If you already have these good financial habits, that’s great. If not, the best time to start developing them is now. Everyone will have their own goals and needs, and, unfortunately, not all of those can be satisfied at the same time. You’ll have to prioritize your goals, but once you do, you can start building healthy habits that will allow you to reach them. Separating your needs from your wants, saving early and often, taking advantage of tax-favored retirement savings plans, and investing now can help you build a solid financial foundation and get you where you want to go.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/4-healthy-financial-habits-develop-now-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NerdWallet.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

In light of a new Department of Labor rule requiring all financial advisors to act as fiduciaries for retirement accounts, </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in which we strongly believe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Oliver skewered the opaque tendencies of brokers and traditional financial advisors. He urges viewers to bring their business to a transparent fiduciary who has your best interest at heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oliver’s segment serves an important purpose — many regular people who trust a traditional financial advisor with their money, or millennials who are just now beginning to think about retirement planning, simply don’t know the many ways the advisor could be robbing them of their hard-earned money. While not everyone is as clueless as the woman whom Oliver ridicules for asking CNBC host Suze Orman whether she should spend $4,000 to get an elf-spotting certification in Iceland, the many ways traditional financial advisors hurt their clients are often hidden unless the client does the digging themselves. With that in mind, here are four major takeaways from Oliver’s monologue.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>1. Many financial advisors may not have your best interest at heart — but you can find one who does.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Oliver notes, “financial advisor” is a vague term. Even so, many traditional financial advisors  are not fiduciaries, and instead operate on commission. (<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">An advisor who is a fiduciary</a> must always act in the best interests of you, the client.) This means they can execute trades and strategies that line their own pockets with little regard for your financial well-being. We believe that this is unacceptable; as a result, we operate as a fee-only fiduciary that does not receive any sort of commission. While some advisors make money by endorsing a particular investment or product to their clients, we are paid only by our clients.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. The “active management” of many funds and advisors can destroy your capital.</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we’ve previously detailed </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in this blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you shouldn&#8217;t expect to win with actively managed funds. Not only do these funds fail to outperform the market, but in doing so they also accrue massive fees due to the large amount of trades they are making. While compound interest grows your investment over time, interest isn’t the only thing that compounds — fees do as well. Oliver cites a study in which an index of stocks, selected by a cat throwing a ball at them, outperformed an actively managed fund overseen by experts. The cat earned returns of 7%, while the pros garnered only 3.5%. Oliver summarizes the situation succinctly: “If you stick around doing nothing while everyone else around you [messes] up, you’re going to win big.” At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe sticking with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">investments that focus on low cost and tax efficiency</a> is the best way to save for the long term. ETFs are an investment vehicle that we utilize to accomplish this goal. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>3. It doesn’t have to be this complicated, and it might be getting simpler.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are easy steps you can take. Start saving now — it’s never too early. When screening financial advisors, ask if they are fiduciaries. With your money in the hands of a fiduciary who puts your best interest first, you can be confident in your advisor’s motivations. </span></p>\n<p>Feel like the little guy/girl who can&#8217;t get the time of day from your &#8220;financial advisor&#8221;?

These principles aren’t abstract — they have real consequences for real people, like you.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To demonstrate all of this, Oliver examined the 401k his own employees at HBO were using through their provider. The retirement fund charged 1.69% fees, and their broker refused to offer low-cost, low-fee plans. The advisor even messed up the calculations on the compounding interest, making his original math off by over $10,000,000. These are not the actions of someone who values his/her clients more than a paycheck; on the other hand, we value our partnership in our clients’ future success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Oliver went wrong is when he questioned why anyone would invite their financial advisor to their wedding. We are proof that a relationship like that is possible between client and advisor. As a fiduciary, when we consistently act in the best interests of our clients, we end up building strong friendships with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we have long been at the forefront of the fiduciary movement for transparency and conflict-free advice. At a traditional insurance company or wire house, advisors will often recommend expensive funds produced by their institution; on the other hand, we can take a more holistic view of investments to determine which are best for you. We believe in growing with you, not at your expense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We encourage you to trust your retirement to an advisor who will act only in your best interest. Curious what that looks like? </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/portfolio-analysis-strategy-session/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule a free portfolio analysis and strategy session with us.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the full John Oliver video </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZSpET11ZY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Retirement Plans: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvZSpET11ZY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

But the reality is that most investors are actually underperforming their benchmark. Two recent articles regarding behavioral finance — <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051116/which-investor-personality-best-describes-you/\">Which Investor Personality Best Describes You?</a></em> and <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051916/8-common-biases-impact-investment-decisions/\"><em>8 Common Investor Biases That Impact Investment Decisions</em></a> — detail a concept which is the thought that our own instinctive behaviors are the biggest challenge to us as investors. Another topic that we have written on is the issue with trying to “time” the market. What people often don’t realize is that these two concepts have more in common than you might think.</p>\n<p>For over two decades, financial research firm Dalbar has been analyzing investor returns. It recently published its 22<sup>nd</sup> annual <em><a href=\"http://www.dalbar.com/ProductsServices/DALBARPresentsQAIB/tabid/357/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior</a></em> study that compared these investor equity fund returns versus the market benchmark. The results showed significant underperformance from investors. <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/04/26/832952/0/en/Better-Investment-Recommendations-equals-Greater-Returns-DALBAR-Annual-Report-of-Investor-Returns-Says-Not-So.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dalbar points out</a> that “for the 30 years ended Dec. 31, 2015, the S&amp;P 500 index produced an annual return of 10.35%, while the average equity mutual fund investor earned only 3.66%. The gap of 6.69 percentage points represents the diminished returns.”</p>\n<p>So why is this the case?</p>\n<p>As advisors, we have long preached the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">importance of cost</a> and the large effects it can have on returns. While cost is a factor in investor underperformance, there are other factors that play even a larger role. The study showed that the biggest contributing factor to equity investors&#8217; underperformance over the past 20 years is voluntary investor behavior. What does that mean? Let’s look at a couple of examples of investor behavior that contributes to underperformance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>1. Panic selling: </strong>The No. 1 rule in a market collapse is not to panic. Markets can be erratic with times of larger-than-normal volatility. Responding emotionally is never a good idea. Start by understanding what your risk tolerance is. At that point, make sure you understand your investments and what their purpose is in your portfolio. Finally, look at your portfolio as a whole and make sure it is aligned properly with your risk tolerance and goals.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>2. Trend chasing/herd mentality/FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):</strong> As the phrase goes: what you see is what you believe. When investors see a stock continue to go up, or everyone around them is talking about buying that stock, it is easy to follow the crowd and jump in without thinking. History has shown us that past performance is no guarantee of future returns.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>3. Overconfidence: </strong>Many investors feel they perform better than what is actually happening or real.

The <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/13/coming-soon-the-biggest-wealth-transfer-in-history.html\">biggest wealth transfer in history </a>is beginning, as Millennials will soon become the wealth bearing demographic in this county.  Not surprisingly, as we pointed out in a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Personal%20Finance%20Blog\">recent blog post</a>, personal finance is a huge issue for many Millennials. But where can a Millennial turn for advice?</p>\n<p>Goals, dreams, jobs, family plans, etc. are going to vary widely, but there a few common themes that seem relevant across the spectrum. We constantly write on many of these issues, so decided to summarize the topics for you and answer some of those nagging questions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting started</strong> is often the hardest part. Beginning a savings plan early is key, which makes planning all the more important. We constantly preach the importance of determining your short, intermediate and long term goals and then focusing on creating a plan on how to achieve them. Having the “money conversation” is a great way to get started. Remember, it’s not how much you make, but how much you save.

So how do you determine if your focus should be on accelerating the payoff of that debt or maximizing saving instead? We wrote about that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/save-money-pay-debt/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Save%20Money%20or%20Pay%20Down%20Debt\">here</a><u>.</u></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investing</strong> &#8211; Only 26 percent of people under age 30 own stocks, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/more-millennials-say-no-to-stocks-and-advisors-adapt.html\">CNBC story. </a>Time is one of the greatest assets Millennials have working in their favor. Yet  because of various reasons that have scared many away from the stock market, a vast majority of millennials are missing out on <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Volatility%20and%20Compound%20Interest\">potential compound interest</a><u>, and other benefits of long term investing</u>.

Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades. As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first time investors, it’s actually one of the main reasons I created Sherman Wealth Management. It was important to me to make sure top notch financial advice was available to anyone and everyone,  particularly to those who are starting out on the path to wealth accumulation. We created this guide to make sure you are asking your potential financial advisors the right questions to determine if they are right for you. – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=6%20questions%20to%20ask%20advisor\">6 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marriage</strong> &#8211; Getting married is more than just substituting the word “ours” for “yours” and “mine”. It’s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions – even your music – and making all of that “ours” too. If you have started to think about marriage, or are married already, there are a few financial discussions you should be sure you have.  Since a significant part of those pre-marital dreams and aspirations involve money, having multiple financial conversations before marriage (or right after, if you’re newlyweds!) can help you start married life on a firmer footing, with regard to financial goals. Here are two blogs we wrote for those getting married or already married.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/10-things-to-discuss-before-marriage/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=10%20Things%20Before%20Marriage\">10 Things to Discuss Before Marriage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/7-things-married-couples-discuss-today/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=7%20Things%20Married%20Couples%20Should%20Discuss\">7 Things Married Couples Should Discuss Today</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buying a house</strong> &#8211; There are studies out there saying that Millennials are not buying houses. A prudent home purchase often can be one of the most stable and solid investments a young person can make. So why the hesitation? Some Millennials wonder if given the rate increase and current market turmoil – if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now? We wrote about this exact topic <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/do-interest-rates-have-you-worried-about-buying-a-first-home/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Interest%20Rates%20Buying%20House\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kids </strong>&#8211; Babies change your life in many ways, including requiring large amounts of time and money.

In previously discussing behavioral finance, we focused on <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investor-personality-best-describes/\">four common personality types of investors</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s focus on the common behavioral biases that affect our investment decisions.</p>\n<p>The concept of behavioral finance helps us recognize our natural biases that lead us to making illogical and often irrational decisions when it comes to investments and finances. A prime example of this is the concept of prospect theory, which is the idea that as humans, our emotional response to perceived losses is different than to that of perceived gains. According to prospect theory, losses for an investor feel twice as painful as gains feel good. Some investors worry more about the marginal percentage change in their wealth than they do about the amount of their wealth. This thought process is backwards and can cause investors to fixate on the wrong issues.</p>\n<p>The chart below is a great example of this emotional rollercoaster and how it impacts our investment decisions.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/8_common_biases_that/image001.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h2>The Psychology of Investing Biases</h2>\n<p>Behavioral biases hit us all as investors and can vary depending upon our investor personality type. These biases can be cognitive, illustrated by a tendency to think and act in a certain way or follow a rule of thumb. Biases can also be emotional: a tendency to take action based on feeling rather than fact.</p>\n<p>Pulled from a <a href=\"http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=286116065002000088064002074106019097023057071055063005125104112022119101005085097014107106052111061028034095091106066028101028102070004033004122011011095091091010055044031092114081116083016100025003099116123064120027097100019064066081120127086022074&amp;EXT=pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> by H. Kent Baker and Victor Ricciardi that looks at how biases impact investor behavior, here are eight biases that can affect investment decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anchoring or Confirmation Bias:</strong> First impressions can be hard to shake because we tend to selectively filter, paying more attention to information that supports our opinions while ignoring the rest. Likewise, we often resort to preconceived opinions when encountering something — or someone — new. An investor whose thinking is subject to confirmation bias would be more likely to look for information that supports his or her original idea about an investment rather than seek out information that contradicts it.</li>\n<li><strong>Regret Aversion Bias: </strong>Also known as loss aversion, regret aversion describes wanting to avoid the feeling of regret experienced after making a choice with a negative outcome. Investors who are influenced by anticipated regret take less risk because it lessens the potential for poor outcomes. Regret aversion can explain an investor&#8217;s reluctance to sell losing investments to avoid confronting the fact that they have made poor decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Disposition Effect Bias: </strong>This refers to a tendency to label investments as winners or losers. Disposition effect bias can lead an investor to hang onto an investment that no longer has any upside or sell a winning investment too early to make up for previous losses. This is harmful because it can increase capital gains taxes and can reduce returns even before taxes.</li>\n<li><strong>Hindsight Bias:</strong> Another common perception bias is hindsight bias, which leads an investor to believe after the fact that the onset of a past event was predictable and completely obvious whereas, in fact, the event could not have been reasonably predicted.</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarity Bias:</strong> This occurs when investors have a preference for familiar or well-known investments despite the seemingly obvious gains from diversification. The investor may feel anxiety when diversifying investments between well known domestic securities and lesser known international securities, as well as between both familiar and unfamiliar stocks and bonds that are outside of his or her comfort zone. This can lead to suboptimal portfolios with a greater a risk of losses.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-attribution Bias:</strong> Investors who suffer from self-attribution bias tend to attribute successful outcomes to their own actions and bad outcomes to external factors. They often exhibit this bias as a means of self-protection or self-enhancement. Investors affected by self-attribution bias may become overconfident.</li>\n<li><strong>Trend-chasing Bias:</strong> Investors often chase past performance in the mistaken belief that historical returns predict future investment performance. This tendency is complicated by the fact that some product issuers may increase advertising when past performance is high to attract new investors. Research demonstrates, however, that investors do not benefit because performance usually fails to persist in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Worry:</strong> The act of worrying is a natural — and common — human emotion. Worry evokes memories and creates visions of possible future scenarios that alter an investor’s judgment about personal finances. Anxiety about an investment increases its perceived risk and lowers the level of risk tolerance. To avoid this bias, investors should match their level of risk tolerance with an appropriate asset allocation strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Avoiding Behavioral Mistakes</h2>\n<p>By understanding the common behavioral mistakes investors make, a quality financial planner will aim to help clients take the emotion out of investing by creating a tactical, strategic investment plan customized to the individual. Some examples of strategies that help with this include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Systematic Asset Allocation: </strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We utilize investment strategies</a> such as dollar cost averaging to create a systematic plan of attack that takes advantage of market fluctuations, even in a down market period.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Mitigation: </strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investor-risk-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The starting point</a> of any investment plan starts with understanding an individual&#8217;s risk tolerance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important aspect of behavioral finance is peace of mind. By having a thorough understanding of your risk appetite, the purpose of each investment in your portfolio and the implementation plan of your strategy, it allows you to feel much more confident about your investment plan and be less likely to make common behavioral mistakes.</p>\n<p>Working with a financial planner can help investors recognize and understand their own individual behavioral biases and predispositions, and thus be able to avoid making investment decisions based entirely on those biases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This is commonly referred to as behavioral finance. As part of a two-part series on Behavioral Finance, we will start by exploring the different personality types of most investors. When it comes to money and investing, there are many factors that contribute to the “how” and “why” of important financial decisions.</p>\n<h2>Investor Personality Types</h2>\n<p>There are four different types of investors, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/pwmn.v2012.n1.5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFA Institute</a>, each with their own distinct behavioral biases. Understanding your own investor personality type can go a long way toward helping you determine and meet your long term investment goals, as well as producing better returns. (For more from Brad Sherman, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\"><em>6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Which of these profiles best describes you?</p>\n<h2>Preservers</h2>\n<p>Preservers are investors who place a great deal of emphasis on financial security and on preserving wealth rather than taking <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\">risks</a> to grow wealth. Preservers watch closely over their assets and are anxious about losses and short-term performance. Preservers also have trouble taking action for fear of making the wrong investments decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Preservers:</strong> An investment strategy should take into account short-, mid- and long-term goals. By overemphasizing short-term returns, an investor risks making an emotional decision based on the short-term performance, which may end up being more detrimental to them in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Accumulators</h2>\n<p>Accumulators are investors who are interested in accumulating wealth and are confident they can do so. Accumulators tend to want to steer the ship when it comes to making investment decisions. They are risk takers and typically believe that whatever path they choose is the correct one. Accumulators have frequently been successful in prior business endeavors and are confident that they will make successful investors as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Common issue with Accumulators:</strong> Overconfidence. We recently wrote a blog on the issue with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock picking</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">active management.</a> Overconfidence is a natural human tendency. As investors, accumulators consistently overestimate their ability to predict future returns. History has shown that it is impossible to predict markets at large scale, yet accumulators continue to try and do so and expose themselves to extreme risk.</p>\n<h2>Followers</h2>\n<p>Followers are investors who tend to follow the lead of their friends and colleagues, a general investing fad, or the status quo, rather than having their own ideas or making their own decisions about investing. Followers may lack interest and/or knowledge of the financial markets and their decision-making process may lack a long-term plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Followers:</strong> The herd mentality is a concept of investors piling into the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/diversification-gluten-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same investments as others</a>. This is often the basis of investment bubbles and subsequent crashes in the stock market. When you are a follower, you are typically following fund managers who have tools and recourses to act on new information in a fraction of a second. By the time the average investor “follows” them into a position, it is often too late. It is always important to understand your investment decisions and how they fit into your overall plan.</p>\n<h2>Independents</h2>\n<p>Independents are investors who have original ideas about investing and like to be involved in the investment process. Unlike followers, they are very interested in the process of investing, and are engaged in the financial markets. Many Independents are analytical and critical thinkers and trust themselves to make confident and informed decisions, but risk the pitfalls of only following their own research.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Independents:</strong> Similar to overconfidence bias associated with accumulators, independents face similar issues with relying too heavily on their own train of thought. We as humans have ability to convince ourselves that we are correct or that we don’t need guidance, even when that is not the case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

We caught up on wives, kids, work and all the other important parts of our lives. One thing struck me about the conversations, no matter whether I was speaking with liberal arts majors or those who studied corporate finance: While we all know that E=MC2 and maybe even know a fair amount about Einstein’s theory, most of them graduated without having a real clue about personal finance.</p>\n<p>In other words, the financial skills we learn in school are not necessarily the ones we need in the real world — at least when it comes to our personal lives.</p>\n<p>Personal finance is not typically part of a college curriculum. And while some of us have parents or family members who can guide us along the way, those individuals may not be financial experts, and there is a limit to the help they can provide.</p>\n<p>From my experience, most people are interested in financial literacy but don’t know where to go to get started. We all face similar issues, and the less familiar we are with the mechanics of approaching them, the more anxiety-provoking they become.</p>\n<p>The younger you learn, the better off you are. When I was in the first grade, I wanted to be Alex P. Keaton, the money-savvy teenager played by Michael J. Fox on the television sitcom “Family Ties.” It was clear early on that I had an affinity for sound saving, investing and growing money. When I was 7, my grandmother gave me a dollar; I turned it into $5, then $50. I am thrilled by the challenge of helping people reach their financial goals at all stages of their lives.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/do-interest-rates-have-you-worried-about-buying-a-first-home/\" rel=\"nofollow\">buying that first home</a>. Your career is on track, and becoming a homeowner seems like an appropriate goal. So with some excitement and anticipation, you decide to start looking.</p>\n<p>Then the questions begin flooding in. How much home can I afford? How much should I be saving? When is the ideal time to buy? How does a mortgage work? Will I qualify? What’s my credit score? Do I need insurance? How do property taxes work?</p>\n<p>Imagine if there were a course in college (let’s not get crazy and imagine they would teach this in high school) called Personal Finance 101. In addition to the homebuying lessons above, the curriculum could look something like this:</p>\n<h3>Cash flow and budgeting</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What is a budget? <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/160946766\" rel=\"nofollow\">How do I create one?</a> How do I know what I can afford?</p>\n<h3>Building credit and understanding credit cards</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What are the advantages and disadvantages of owning a credit card? How should I decide which one to get?</p>\n<h3>Intro to the stock market and investing</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What are the differences in the various investment vehicles — exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit?</p>\n<h3>Taxes</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> How do I pay taxes? What do I need to pay attention to in my <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tax planning</a>?</p>\n<h3>Future workplace retirement plan options</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\">What is a 401(k),</a> IRA, Roth IRA? When should I start saving? How much should I save?</p>\n<p>My guess is that a course like this would be incredibly valuable to many. It’s complicated stuff. It’s important stuff. It’s the kind of stuff that you actually need to know.</p>\n<p>This is the main reason I chose to get in this line of work. Younger people have no idea where or how to start, and they have no idea where to find help. Traditional financial management institutions have investment minimums that most of us won’t be able to meet for over a decade, if ever. These minimums can range from $250,000 to $500,000, and sometimes are higher. Even if you were fortunate enough to be accepted by a big institutional investment manager, you’re kidding yourself if you think a large institution is going to take the time to explain to you the difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.</p>\n<p>That’s why I chose to create a wealth management model where we would provide the same customized service to all of our clients, without consideration of a minimum initial investment and irrespective of the size of their accounts. We hope that by investing in you early, you’ll see our value for the long term.</p>\n<p>If you are reading this and can relate to some of these thoughts, know that it’s not just you. It doesn’t matter whether you majored in art or corporate finance, you almost certainly did not take a class in Personal Finance 101. The good news is, you don’t have to go at it alone. Seek the help that is out there, and learn what you may have missed in college.</p>\n<p>This article was originally published on NerdWallet.com</p>\n<p><em>This article also appears on <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-personal-finance-classes-should-be-taught-in-college-cm610810\">Nasdaq</a>.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

A good financial advisor is there to prevent you from making decisions that would have a negative, unintended impact on you. Who wouldn’t love to have a financial coach to keep you on track to achieve your financial goals?</p>\n<p>Just like with any working relationship, it’s a good idea to interview advisors until you find the one who is the best fit for you, your life, and your financial goals. Since you are entrusting your financial well-being to someone, you should get to know them and their financial planning and<u> </u>investing philosophy before committing to a long-term relationship.</p>\n<p>As you may have heard the Department of Labor (DOL) has just released its new fiduciary rule in its final form. We previously wrote about the reasons why someone would <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">oppose this rule</a> considering it was created to improve financial transparency and eliminate conflicted advice from advisors. While this rule would still allow advisors to keep their “conflicted” commissions in some instances, it would require advisors to act as fiduciaries (a.k.a. “best interests contract”) when handling client’s retirement accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/\">We have long been proponents</a> of more transparency and conflict-free advice and feel this is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>So how does this affect your search for the right financial advisor? Here are 6 questions to ask to help with finding a financial advisor.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Are You a Fiduciary? (Are You ALWAYS a Fiduciary?)<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, this new rule will only require financial advisors to act as a fiduciary for client’s <u>retirement accounts</u>. A fiduciary is regulated by federal law and must adhere to strict standards. They must act in the client’s best interest, in good faith, and they must provide full disclosure regarding fees, compensation, and any current or potential conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Until now, broker-dealers, insurance salesman, bank and financial company representatives, and others were only required to follow a Suitability Standard. That means they only had to provide recommendations that are “suitable” for a client – based on age or aversion to risk for example – but this may or may not be in that client’s best interest.</p>\n<p>The brokerage industry, as you can probably imagine, and all those who earn their compensation from commissions are strongly against these new rules.</p>\n<p>Even with this new law passed, we feel it is important to make sure your advisor is acting as a fiduciary when dealing with ANY of your finances, not just retirement accounts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2. What is Your Fee Structure? (Difference Between Fee-Only, Fee-Based and Commission)</strong></h3>\n<p>Advisors throw out terms like “fee-based” and consumers assume that is the same as<br />\n“fee-only.” That is not the case. At Sherman Wealth Management, we are fee-only which means that we are paid <u>exclusively</u> by our clients, so we are completely <strong>conflict-free</strong>. We do not get commissions from the investments or products we recommend. We do not get bonuses based on how many clients we get to invest in company products. We are paid an hourly or quarterly fee by our clients who retain us because we are making their money work for them with only their best interest in mind.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent your best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you.</p>\n<p>Do not assume that an advisor is following a fiduciary standard with their compensation now. The new rules will not be enforced until 2018. Ask your financial advisor to clearly specify their fees. With many layers of diversification that can be applied to your portfolio, you want to be aware of whether you are exposed to up-front charges, back-end fees, expense ratios, and/or whether a percentage of your returns will be deducted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Why Are They Right for YOU?</strong></h3>\n<p>A financial advisor should be able to tell you their strengths and what sets them apart. Some advisors will advise on investments while others specialize in comprehensive financial planning. While you may think all advisors are the same, and it certainly may seem like that on the surface, by now you should be seeing that is not the case.</p>\n<p>Ask how involved they are with their client’s portfolios. Are they hands-on in their approach? How available are they for their clients’ needs?</p>\n<p>For us, we enjoy serving a wide-range of clients, from young first-timers who are just getting started with investing and financial planning, to experienced savers, to high-net-worth investors who are well on their way to financial independence.</p>\n<p>We strive to understand our clients wants and needs. We help our clients plan for the long term while simultaneously working to avoid short-term roadblocks. We do so by making it a point to SHOW you that you are not alone. We’re just like you, we’ve been there, and we know that financial planning can be an anxiety provoking activity for many. We use a fluid process to help set clear, realistic goals with an easy to understand roadmap of what you need to do to get there. We are right there with you every step of the way.</p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s world you don’t just want a trusted advisor, you want instant access to your accounts and the progress you are making. That is why we offer some of the best in new financial services technology tools.</p>\n<p>[video_embed video=&#8221;160946766&#8243; parameters=&#8221;&#8221; mp4=&#8221;&#8221; ogv=&#8221;&#8221; placeholder=&#8221;&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8243; height=&#8221;281&#8243;]</p>\n<p>The relationship with your financial advisor is an important one. You need to feel comfortable with whom you are working with.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4. What is Your Investment Philosophy?</strong></h3>\n<p>Every financial advisor has a specific approach to planning and investing. Some advisors prefer trying to time the market and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\">actively manage funds versus passive investments.</a> Others may seek to gain high returns and make riskier investments. Your goals and risk tolerance need to align with the advisor’s philosophy.</p>\n<p>When anyone invests money, they are doing so with the hopes of growing it faster than inflation. While some traditional investment managers not only want to generate a profitable return, they aim to beat the market by taking advantage of pricing discrepancies and attempting to time the market and predict the future. Some investment companies offer “one-size-fits-all” investment management solutions that only take into account your age and income.</p>\n<p>We have a different approach. We believe an individuals best chance at building wealth through the capital markets is to avoid common <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-finance-instinctive-behaviors/\">behavioral biases</a> in the beginning and utilize a well thought out, disciplined, and long-term approach to investing. We create a well diversified, customized portfolio that focuses on tax efficiency, cost effectiveness, and risk management. Read more about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">how we do this. </a></p>\n<p>Make it a top priority to understand the strategy your advisor uses and that you are comfortable with it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>5. How Personalized Are Your Recommendations for Your Clients? </strong></h3>\n<p>It is important that your financial advisor tailors your financial plan to your specific goals. Your retirement plan and investment strategy should be customized to take into account your risk tolerance, age, income, net-worth, and other factors specific to your situation. There should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to managing your money.</p>\n<p>Some traditional brokers and insurance companies are so big that it becomes impossible for them to give you a truly individualized experience. They have a corporate agenda that they must follow and it can restrict the service they provide to you.</p>\n<p>As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first-time investors, it has also inspired a new breed of smaller independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs), like Sherman Wealth Management. What our clients all have in common is that they appreciate the focus on their own individual goals and best interests that we guarantee as a boutique, independent, fee-only fiduciary.</p>\n<p>We know that each client is unique.  We don’t look for “market efficiencies” or work for sales commissions on the products we recommend. Our focus is different. We strive to help investors build a strong foundation and grow with them, not by profiting off good or bad trades. This gives us the opportunity to create individual strategies and plans that are uniquely suited to each client, not just a cookie-cutter plan based on age, income, or broadly assessed risk tolerance.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h3><strong>6. Do You Have Any Asset or Revenue Minimums?</strong></h3>\n<p>Some have argued that the proposed DOL rule will end up hurting the small investor because larger institutions will not be willing to serve small accounts. This logic is fundamentally backward and flawed, as those clients were never on their radar to begin with. In fact, the ability for these large institutions to generate commissions and thus charge more to these small investor clients have driven that business, without regard to the best interests of the individual investor.</p>\n<p>For example, In a company statement quoted by <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/12/18/wells-fargo-2016-comp-plan-pushes-fas-to-give-away\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Janet Levaux</a> in Think Advisor, Wells Fargo, the most valuable financial institution in the world according to the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-co-is-the-earths-most-valuable-bank-1437538216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall Street Journal</a>, said that in 2016, “bonuses will be awarded to FAs with 75% of their client households at $250,000.”</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo isn’t the only large institution effectively ignoring Millennials and other smaller and entry-level clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net-worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades.</p>\n<p>The complaints against the new DOL rule have nothing to do with protecting the little guy. Rather, the complaints are driven by the desire of commission-based large institutions, insurance companies, and broker-dealers who are trying to protect their ability to generate commissions and charge clients unnecessary fees.</p>\n<p>Make sure you understand your advisor’s motivations.

A fiduciary standard ensures that the advisor&#8217;s duty is to the client only, not the corporation they represent. To the surprise of many, that currently is not always the case. Financial advisors have had the ability to profit (through commissions and high fees) to the potential detriment of their clients. That is exactly what many large financial institutions and insurance companies have done. In fact, the federal government estimates that there are roughly <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/cea_coi_report_final.pdf\">$17 billion dollars</a> of fees generated each year from conflicted advice.</p>\n<p>The DOL has made clear &#8211;and we agree&#8211; that a commission based investment model creates a conflict of interest. Companies with a commission based model operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest. For example, an advisor may receive a 5% commission by selling you a fund through their company when you could get a similar product elsewhere without commission. Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent your best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you. That is the primary reason we stay completely independent and operate as conflict-free, fee-only advisors.</p>\n<p>The proposed DOL rule will hopefully begin to fix this issue as it is expected to require a strict fiduciary standard for financial advisors in the context of sales for retirement account products.  This standard will require advisors to certify that they are acting independently and in their client’s best interest, and are not motivated by the prospect of a commission. This has created a firestorm among big insurance companies, broker dealers and other institutional investors who, as we pointed out, don’t typically operate as fiduciaries.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/306476032/Elizabeth-Warren-letter-to-SEC?secret_password=aGGzGnDFye7HhhQe5m4V\">letter sent last week to the SEC</a>, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a strong proponent of the proposed DOL rule, pointed out that presidents of Transamerica, Lincoln National, Jackson National and Prudential all have called this proposal “unworkable.”  She commented on the self interest in their position, and the danger in permitting unwitting investors to be guided by non-fiduciaries in the context of their retirement investments.</p>\n<p>Why would a rule that requires a financial advisor to act in their client&#8217;s best interest create such an uproar? One reason is that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unlike Sherman Wealth Management</a>, they are in a commission driven model, and therefore fear that the way they currently serve clients would not meet the standards of this new rule. We hope that because of the conflict a commission driven model creates, that eventually enough pressure from policy-makers like Senator Warren and Labor Secretary Perez will propel this proposed new rule beyond just retirement accounts. In the meantime, think to yourself why anyone would oppose this rule if not for purely selfish reasons?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

It’s also true for professionally run, actively managed mutual funds.</p>\n<p>Actively managed funds are tasked with picking a collection of stocks and bonds that will outperform market indices, or benchmarks, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow. They’re armed with Ph.D. analysts, hundreds of interns, and tools and research to which very few of us have access — but they can’t consistently beat their benchmarks by enough to justify their costs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Long-term underperformance</strong></h3>\n<p>Eighty-six percent of actively managed funds failed to beat their benchmarks in 2014, according to the<a href=\"http://www.spindices.com/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices scorecard</a>. “So what?” you may say, “That’s only one year.” But 89% of funds failed to beat their benchmarks during the past five years; 82% failed to do so during the last decade.</p>\n<p>The following data help illustrate how unlikely it is for active managers to beat the market over longer periods.

A manager who outperformed last year may not do it again this year.</p>\n<h3><strong>Reasons for underperformance</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a few main reasons actively managed funds underperform, aside from picking the wrong investments:</p>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/mutual-fund-fees-what-investors-need-to-know/\">FEES</a></strong></h4>\n<p>Many actively managed funds charge 1% to 2% per year in management fees, while a passively managed exchange-traded fund could charge as little as 0.1% to 0.2% per year. And many actively managed mutual funds are <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/125.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loaded funds</a>, which means you’ll pay a sales charge, typically between 4% to 8% of your investment, when you buy or sell the fund — though the fee may decrease the longer you stay invested. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=active%20vs%20passive&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dollar%20cost%20averaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compounded over time</a>, these higher fees can eat up a lot of gain, reducing overall returns.</p>\n<h4><strong>TAXES</strong></h4>\n<p>Because actively managed funds try to time the market and pick winners, they buy and sell positions frequently. These transaction costs reduce the fund’s returns, and all the buying and selling can also create taxable gain. Fund managers have no incentive to avoid this because they simply pass those taxable gains on to you, the shareholder.</p>\n<h4><strong>MARKET EFFICIENCY</strong></h4>\n<p>Some argue that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13stra.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">markets are becoming more efficient</a>, making it difficult to identify overvalued or undervalued stocks. The efficient market hypothesis states that stocks are constantly adjusting to news and information, and thus their share prices reflect their “fair value.” In simpler language, other than in the very short term, there are no undervalued stocks to buy or inflated stocks to sell. This makes it virtually impossible to outperform the market through individual stock selection and market timing.</p>\n<h3><strong>An unsustainable approach</strong></h3>\n<p>Whether active management can outperform is a controversial topic. Many experts dismiss the science and say that they can indeed beat the market. Some of them may even do so for a year or two, or even five, but what about over the long run? It’s simply not sustainable, and to think otherwise is dangerous.</p>\n<p>If the data shows that the vast majority of the brightest and most well-equipped professional investors can’t beat their benchmarks, why should you believe anyone who says they can?</p>\n<p><em>This story also appears on <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/dont-expect-to-win-with-actively-managed-funds-cm597983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nasdaq</a>.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Cherry blossoms are out, baseball opening day is right around the corner, and the best single elimination tournament in sports is on its way. That’s right, it’s March Madness time.</p>\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar, March Madness, as it’s commonly called, is a 64-team college basketball single elimination tournament. There are four regions that each have 16 teams seeded 1 though 16. The winners of each region meet in the “final four” to determine who will emerge as the champion.</p>\n<p>Offices around the country are buzzing with brackets, upset picks and friendly wagers. In other words, it’s chaos both on and off the court and it’s glorious!</p>\n<p>In case you couldn’t tell, I love sports.

What may come as a surprise to you is that investing and March Madness have more in common than you think.</p>\n<p>So what does the tournament have to do with investing? Let’s have some fun and take a look.</p>\n<p><strong>You Can’t Predict the Future</strong></p>\n<p>Every year people get excited about their bracket. We watch the “experts” on TV and eagerly listen to their reasons for picking one team over another. We all go into the season thinking that this is “our year.” We’ve done the research and we’ve studied history. What could possibly go wrong?</p>\n<p>In the first round of this year’s tournament, a record 10 double-digit seeds advanced to the second round! Do you think a lot of people predicted that? Not a chance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3064\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3064 size-medium\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1-300x194.jpg\" alt=\"March Madness Brackets\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Have you ever heard the saying on Wall Street that past performance does not guarantee future performance? There’s a reason the saying exists. Just like last year’s successful mutual fund managers aren’t any more likely to pick this year’s best accounts, the winner of last year’s bracket pool is no more likely than you to pick this year’s winning March Madness team.</p>\n<p>When it comes to investing, “experts” love to tell us what is going to happen in the future. People brag about their best stock picks and conveniently leave out their poor ones. <strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Stock%20Picking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The truth is, no one knows what is coming.</a></strong> Once you accept that, you can create a financial plan that takes into account your <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/embed/90260b609e67a973f2f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk tolerance</a>, and current life situation to make the best investment decisions for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification and Risk vs. Reward</strong></p>\n<p>No one picks a perfect bracket. The odds of filling out a perfect bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion (source: <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/03/19/ncaa-tournament-perfect-bracket-odds-quintillion/1999795/\">USA Today</a>). According to that number, if everyone in the US filled out one bracket each year, we would see a perfect bracket once every 400 years. You’d be better off gambling with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/powerball-ticket/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Power%20Ball\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the lottery</a> based on those odds.</p>\n<p>However, straying from the standard “favorites” isn’t always the answer either. People love to pick the underdog or “dark horse,” but if you do this consistently year after year, you aren’t likely to have much success. <strong>That doesn’t mean you can’t pick an underdog here or there, but the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Stock%20Picking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risky picks</a> should be a subset of your overall picks, not the full strategy. </strong></p>\n<p>The truth is, no one wins a bracket pool by picking all favorites or all upsets. As the point above taught us, everyone is just guessing. By diversifying your picks with some favorites and some upsets, you give yourself the best chance at success.</p>\n<p>The same principal applies with investing. If your portfolio is composed of stocks from one sector or all growth stocks, you are exposing yourself to huge amounts of risk. Sure, the reward may be great if you end up being right, but as we’ve seen time and time again, that is a strategy that can set you up for disaster.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

But there’s a problem with this method of investing. Like gambling in Vegas, it may be fun and even rewarding in the short term. Yet in the end, just as the house always wins, picking stocks is a losing game.</p>\n<p>I talk to friends all the time who say they invest in stocks — meaning individual ones rather than broad-based index funds that capture the movement of the entire market — and I always wonder why. I think many people see a company that carries a well-known name — maybe they are customers or they hear about it on the news — and they assume it’s a good investment. But history has shown us time and time again that picking stocks of individual companies, and thus trying to determine which will be the winners, is not a good investment strategy.</p>\n<p>No company is immune to short- or long-term failure, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-valeant-dilemma-how-diversified-is-your-diversification/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=stock%20picking&amp;utm_campaign=valeant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no matter how good they look in the moment</a>. The company’s value may not go to zero, but it could certainly take a huge hit relative to its underlying industry or index. Just think about <a href=\"http://snip.ly/4evwv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index has changed</a> in the past two decades. There has been a revolving door among the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500, proving that even the biggest companies out there are not immune to <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/\">volatility</a> and risk.</p>\n<h3>Individual stocks vs. an index</h3>\n<p>As further evidence that picking stocks is risky and ultimately a losing game, consider recent research from financial firm <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/Eye_on_the_Market_September_2014_-_Executive_Summary.pdf?blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1320684901654&amp;blobheader=application/pdf&amp;blobheadername1=Cache-Control&amp;blobheadervalue1=private&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</a> It compared the Russell 3000 index — which, as the company notes, “represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market” — between 1980 and 2014 with information on individual stocks. Here are the three main findings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The risk of ‘catastrophic’ failure </strong><strong>among individual stocks is </strong><strong>higher than you think. </strong>“When looking at how often a stock has what we call a ‘catastrophic decline’ — falling 70% or more and never recovering — we see that 40% of all stocks suffer this fate at some time in their history. And some sectors — like telecom, biotech and energy — saw higher-than-average loss rates,” the report states.</li>\n<li><strong>Most stocks underperform over their lifetime.</strong> According to the report, “The data shows that two-thirds of all individual stocks underperform over their ‘lifetime,’ as compared to the Russell 3000. On average, the outcome for individual stocks was underperformance of about 50%.”</li>\n<li><strong>Concentrated holdings in individual stocks add huge amounts of risk to your portfolio.</strong> “When computing the optimal risk-adjusted return for a concentrated holder,” the report notes, “we find that 75% of concentrated stockholders would benefit from some degree of diversification.”</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why investors keep picking stocks</h3>\n<p>So why do so many individuals keep trying to pick stocks? I see two main reasons.</p>\n<p>We all enjoy making money, and we don’t usually associate the word “boring” with something we enjoy. That reason alone likely explains why so many people try to pick stocks. It’s the “sexy” way to invest. But the research is clear that this is not an optimal strategy. When it comes to investing, “sexy” might as well be spelled “sucker.”</p>\n<p>Rather, investing should be boring. It’s like baseball: Base hits are the name of the game. By properly diversifying your investment portfolio — picking a mix of asset classes with exposure to many sectors and countries — with a long-term strategy, you allow yourself to take advantage of compounded gains without subjecting yourself to unnecessary risk (i.e., swinging for the fences).</p>\n<p>The other major issue is that not all investors understand what they are doing. When you’re stock-picking, you may think that you are diversified by owning five different stocks; but if that’s all you own, you’re exposing yourself to a huge amount of risk by having such a large percentage of your portfolio invested in just one stock or industry. One catastrophic loss could devastate your portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Diversification</h3>\n<p>The logical question you might have is, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=stock%20picking&amp;utm_campaign=Most%20Important%20Question%20to%20Ask%20Financial%20Advisor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“OK, so what should I do?” </a>While answers are going to vary slightly for each individual, one applies across the board: Diversify. That doesn’t mean owning many different individual stocks in the same sector, but rather spreading your investments throughout multiple asset classes, industries and countries. Proper diversification of your portfolio is key to your investing success over the long run.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Now reality has set in.</p>\n<p>As with all market corrections, this one has inspired retail investors to question whether it’s time to pull money out, shift to safer and more stable investments or just throw in the towel entirely.</p>\n<p>While it is normal to feel anxiety during a downturn, there’s another way to look at it. As long as downturns and dips don’t affect your financial plan or, more specifically, your immediate need for cash, they can be an opportunity.</p>\n<p>Remember the mantra “buy low and sell high”? The volatility, geopolitical risk and uncertainty we’ve experienced so far in 2016 have presented a particular opportunity for investors in the accumulation stage of their lives, or for anyone who has money but hasn’t started investing yet, to actually buy low (or at least lower). If you’ve been delaying investing regularly because the “market was too high” or “you knew a correction was coming,” now might be a good time to start.</p>\n<p>The key is to view volatility — like what we experienced last August and what we are seeing now — as a tool to keep contributing regularly to your investments. This will let you maximize the possible potential for your investments and enable you to watch them grow. The two best concepts to help you do that are dollar-cost averaging and compounded interest.</p>\n<h3>Dollar-cost averaging</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/dollar-cost-averaging/\">Dollar-cost averaging</a> is the process of spreading out the costs of your investments as the market rises and falls, rather than purchasing shares all at one (potentially higher) price. The key is to pick a schedule — whether it’s monthly, bimonthly or weekly — and an amount, no matter how small, and stick to it by purchasing as many additional shares in your investments as your fixed amount will allow. This is much more effective than trying to “time” the market by buying shares when they are at their lowest or selling when they are at their highest.</p>\n<p>Using this system, you are regularly contributing the same amount, regardless of the price of shares. As a result, that fixed dollar amount buys more shares in times when the market has dropped and prices are low, and it limits the amount of shares when the market has risen and prices are high. Over time you will come out ahead, compared with trying to time the market.</p>\n<h3>Compound interest</h3>\n<p>Once you have started to build up the size of your investment with the help of dollar-cost averaging, the concept of <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/compound-interest-save-early/\">compound interest</a> gives you a boost. Compounded interest is the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment already has earned. If you have $1,000, for instance, and it earns 5% interest yearly, you will earn $50 at the end of the first year. Then, if you keep that money invested, the next year you will earn 5% interest on the total — $1,050 — which is $52.50. The following year, you will earn 5% on $1,102.50, which is a little more than $55.</p>\n<p>Because dips in prices allow you to buy more shares with a fixed amount, volatility allows you to maximize the potential for compound interest as well.</p>\n<p>Using these two concepts, the daily ups and downs and market corrections are not a cause for undue concern. If you are sticking to your dollar-cost averaging plan and taking advantage of compound interest, news events shouldn’t affect your long-term plans and goals. Any dollar that is invested in the stock market should be a dollar that you are comfortable keeping invested through a bear market or a major correction.</p>\n<p>If you are disciplined about investing, and consistent about reinvesting, you’ll start to look at market volatility as a tool and an opportunity, rather than as a source of anxiety or, worse, a reason to throw in the towel and lose out on long-term growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
