Sadly, it’s not just one person’s perspective. It’s a sentiment that is shared by the 40-50% of Americans who believe that winning the lottery is the only way they can get what they need for retirement.</p>\n<p>The odds of winning a Powerball have recently been calculated to be 1 in 292,000,000. As a financial advisor, I am frustrated by an investment strategy that is based on a verifiably unrealistic longshot. That frustration is only compounded by the fact that there is a simple solution! The real winning ticket to ensure you can live comfortably in retirement is not a lottery ticket, but rather a concept you likely have heard of but brushed aside: compound interest.</p>\n<p>It’s Been Said That Albert Einstein Called Compound Interest the Eighth Wonder of the World</p>\n<p>And even if he didn’t, it’s still a brilliant investing tool. Simply put, compounding is a process which generates additional return on an asset’s reinvested earnings. To be effective, it requires two simple things: the reinvestment of earnings, and time. If properly managed, compound interest can help your initial investment grow exponentially. For those of you who enjoy math, here’s the formula:</p>\n<p>Ending $$ = Beginning $$ * (1 + return) ^ total time frame of compounding</p>\n<p>While this is a useful strategy for all investors, for young investors in particular, it is the greatest investing tool for long-term growth, and the #1 argument in support of starting as early as possible. Just look at the graph below, which represents the growth of $100 over 30 years:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can see that without reinvestment, the return potential is significantly reduced no matter what the rate of return is. This is important to understand because many investors are tempted to capitalize on their gains too early. The results reflected in this graph make it clear that choosing to instead reinvest those gains is going to make a significant difference in the long run.</p>\n<p>The best advice for how to implement this strategy and maximize your long-run returns is to (1) postpone gains, and (2) rebalance efficiently. When tempted to take a short-term gain, always ask yourself: do you really need to sell? If not, don’t. Committing to a long-range investment strategy will make a world of difference in your returns. And when rebalancing, instead of creating a tax event by taking gains, consider allocating future proceeds into holdings that have underperformed.</p>\n<p>Compounding interest becomes more complicated when the effect of taxes is factored in. Investors are often not able to reinvest all of the money that has been paid out because the government takes its cut. In order to get around this, you should try to minimize the effects of taxes by putting money into tax efficient accounts; ensuring that tax inefficient assets/strategies are in kept in retirement accounts; allocating assets to tax efficient areas of the market such as municipal bonds and real estate; and utilizing ETFs to delay tax events for stock holdings.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be Einstein to understand the power of compounding interest. Instead of putting your fate in the hands of the lottery, take control of your retirement plan through smart, well-thought-out investment decisions.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign of the Times</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t too long ago that every teenager was fawning over the boy-band One Direction.  Now, only a few years later, the band members are all pursuing their own solo careers.  In his 2017 solo debut album, the former One Direction member Harry Styles sings the hook “Just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times.”  While there are numerous interpretations of what the line is about, when I hear it my mind wanders immediately to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe that makes me a finance nerd, but I connect these two because the world of investing is changing so rapidly, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  It used to be that mutual funds were the be-all and end-all of getting exposure to diversified equity and fixed income returns.  Modern trends, though, show that millennial investors are increasingly enamored by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and are pouring more money in these diversified low-cost, passively managed index funds than ever before.  A recent </span><a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-millennials-love-etfs-2016-09-21?mg=prod/accounts-mw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that 66% of millennials say they expect to boost their holdings of ETFs over the next year, up from 61% in last year’s survey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see a similar growth trend in the chart below.  We can see that while asset levels for actively managed mutual funds are still eight times higher than ETF asset levels, there is a staggering difference in their annualized growth rates.  While mutual funds are barely growing at .8%, ETF assets are growing at a pace of 21.4%.  </span></p>\n<p><a

400;\">The conclusion is clear: ETFs took in more than three times the net inflows in the first half of 2017 because </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the world is changing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Millennials are seeking out the funds as an alternative to traditional mutual funds in response to the changing environment around them, the preference for low-fees, and the flexibility of being able to trade in and out of the funds as frequently and as quickly as they desire.  The faster that advisors start to recognize and adapt to that changing world, the better they are able to meet the needs and desires of their clients.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we understand that our clients are seeking low-cost, diversified portfolios and as a fiduciary, we feel it is our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities posed by ETFs.  We were one of the early adopters of these diversified funds because we saw the value of having a low-cost, tax-efficient portfolio that, if done wisely, can be combined to meet target allocations that have diversification benefits creating worthwhile risk-adjusted returns.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see ETFs as an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">opportunity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of competition.  Instead of individual stock picking, ETFs give us the ability to spend our time focusing on a top-down approach to asset allocation.  This means assessing where the opportunities lie within different asset classes and combining attractive ETFs in these</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> high-probability sandboxes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a way that we feel will maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Instead of the cookie-cutter allocation achieved by working with robo-advisors, we have real people putting together your portfolio and looking under the hood of these funds to ensure that they are the best pick for you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we want to be ahead of the times &#8211; not stuck lamenting the past.  </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So… just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times.  </span></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:

Orrin Hatch, Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady) might not have learned as much as they could have from the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which arguably was defeated due to a lack of clear details and shortage of bipartisan support.  In a repeat tactic, the push for passing the bill under “budget reconciliation” would require only a simple majority in the Senate to pass the law.  But it should be noted that this can only happen if projections show that the total revenue differential over the next 10 years is $1.5 trillion or less.  Right now, </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2017/09/27/release-of-gops-long-awaited-tax-plan-reveals-exactly-why-tax-reform-is-so-hard/#35ce89314597\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projections</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> place it at $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.  That means the GOP will either need bipartisan Senate support with 60 votes or find $1 million in reduced projections.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the highlights of the proposed plan and how they could impact your personal income taxes if they should be passed:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fewer Tax Brackets</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Instead of the seven tax brackets we face today ranging from 10% to 39.6%, the new plan proposes only three: 12%, 25%, and 35%.  Because the plan does not specify where these cut-offs will be, though, we can only speculate on how these will impact individuals positively or negatively.  If speculation is correct, those currently facing 28% and 33% tax rates would see a tax cut to the new 25% rate, which would be beneficial.  The idea of adding a fourth bracket for the wealthiest Americans has also been floated.\n<p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Doubles the Standard Deduction, but Eliminates Personal Exemptions <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; The marketing tactic for the bill is that it is a huge break to middle-class Americans by doubling the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for single filers and from $12,000 to $24,000 for joint filers.\n<p></span></b><b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a catch, though</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  These increases are being offset by the elimination of personal exemptions. The result is what seems like a 50% increase to most taxpayers, in reality, is closer to 15%.</p>\n<p></span></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Reduction of Elimination of Itemized Deductions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; If in the past you have chosen to itemize your deductions, you could be getting the short end of the stick here.  The plan calls for reductions or elimination of many itemized deductions, without providing specifics on which ones.  It has only been stated that they will keep the deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions.  It also mentions benefits that encourage work, higher education and retirement savings, but provides no details on these.\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The largest red flag for many is concerning the elimination of state and local tax deductions.  Currently, you can deduct what you pay in state and local taxes from your federal income bill.  If this is eliminated, it could disproportionately affect those who live in high-tax states such as Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California, and Maryland.  Only two days after the plan was released, objections from Blue-state Republicans have caused them to reconsider eliminating these deductions.<br />\n</span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\nAdditionally, homeowners or anyone paying real estate taxes will see that their property taxes are no longer deductible under the new plan.  Again, this will have a disproportionately large impact for those living in states with high real estate taxes.<br />\n</span></b>Below is a breakdown of what the new and old tax brackets could look like for single filers:<i><span><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4073 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"814\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1.png 1251w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-300x125.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-1024x427.png 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-768x320.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px\" /></a></span></i><i><span>Source</span></i><span>: </span><span><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tax-plan-details-corporate-rate-individual-brackets-deductions-cuts-2017-9?nr_email_referer=1&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=PoliticsSelect&amp;pt=385758&amp;ct=Sailthru_BI_Newsletters&amp;mt=8&amp;utm_campaign=BI%20Politics%202017-09-28&amp;utm_term=Politics%20Select%20-%20Engaged%2C%20Active%2C%20Passive%2C%20Disengaged\">Business Insider</a></p>\n<p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Changes for Families</b><span>&#8211; There may be some significant changes to the tax code surrounding families as well, including single parents and households with two or more children.\n<p></span>Currently, single parents fall into a favorable tax bracket somewhere in between single and married-filing-joint rates as well as a 50% boost to their standard deduction.  The new plan would likely eliminate this, meaning single parents could face higher rates.</p>\n<p>That being said, these cuts could potentially be offset by an unspecified “significant increase” to the Child Tax Credit.  Depending on the size of this Child Tax Credit, households with a two or more children could also see increased rates because of the elimination of the exemption based on the number of children.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Eliminates the Death Tax and Alternative Minimum Tax</b><span> &#8211; The estate (“death”) tax only currently applies to 0.14% of Americans, whose assets exceeded $10.9 million and did not hire a competent estate planner.  So this likely does not affect you, but it would be eliminated under this plan.\n<p></span>The alternative minimum tax forces those who have an outsized number of deductions to pay an alternative tax rate instead.  The truth is, very few people understand it anyway.  This is likely a good thing, especially if the goal is simplicity.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Small Businesses, including ours!<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; In terms of small-business owners, there is a whole separate set of changes to be considered.  For ‘pass-through’ businesses like ours, the plan wants to lower the maximum rate from 39.6% to 25%, which is particularly appealing to making smaller firms more competitive.\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Questions still surround this due, though, to Steve Mnuchin’s </span><a href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/09/12/mnuchin-some-services-companies-wont-get-pass-through-tax-rate-update.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vague statements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding limitations on what types of businesses will get this lowered rate as well as how they will distinguish between personal income and business income.  Additionally, many have pointed out that nine in 10 businesses that pass through their income already pay at the 25% rate or less, meaning this change could be ultimately inconsequential.</p>\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For larger corporations, the plan proposes lowering the tax rate from 35% to 20% and a one-time repatriation of overseas assets at an unspecified lower rate.   </span></b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions related to your specific situation, don’t hesitate to contact us </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  We will keep you updated as more developments are made and the plan evolves.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.  They are for information purposes only.

 Are you using unreasonable future growth assumptions to accomplish your goals?  If you are honest with yourself and realize you are taking on more risk than you are comfortable with, you should adjust your risk level and financial plan as soon as possible, not as a reactionary measure to a market downturn.  Additionally, regardless of your risk tolerance, everyone should have an emergency fund that is invested conservatively as a fallback.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel that you are taking a level of risk that you are comfortable with, but are still worried about your own panic getting in the way of your plans &#8211; draft a plan now for how you will deal with it.  If you can’t handle seeing the color red, logging into your portfolio every day is probably not recommended. Ask yourself where there is wiggle room in your financial plan.  Prioritizing your goals and figuring out what you would do differently if the need arose is a good way to feel more secure if things are not going well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think making changes to your portfolio is the right move, make sure get a second opinion from someone with a level-head.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we are committed to answering all of your questions, addressing your concerns and helping you to avoid common behavioral mistakes.  When you imagine yourself in a sinking car, rest assured that we are right there to coach you through it.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**</span></i></p>\n<h6><b><i>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

associate </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan McKenna </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote a great piece about his experience being new to the biz that I thought was worth sharing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">___________________________________________________</span></p>\n<h1><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m new here.  </span></i></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best word I can think of for explaining the experience of being a freshly-graduated analyst entering this market is… </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baffling</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Every week I read the news that markets are hitting new all time highs, that we have shaken off the effects of the global financial crisis and that excellent Q2 earnings reports are the catalyst that will push stocks higher.  There is almost a weekly reminder that markets do not die from old age.  Yesterday, the Dow climbed back above 22000 as investor fears retreated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, every week I also read articles from investors screaming that the end is near, markets cannot possibly keep up with their current pace, P/E ratios are outlandish and we need to be paring back risk.  For example, a month ago, the co-founder and chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital LP, Jeffrey Gundlach, </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/gundlach-wary-of-pricey-market-sets-cap-on-doubleline-s-growth\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that risky assets are overvalued and that investors should be “moving toward the exits.”  Since then, markets have pushed even higher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No wonder the average client is looking to their advisor with a look of complete confusion and truthfully, a fair amount of fear.  In times like these, the words of my graduate-school mentor (one of the most brilliant finance professionals I know) often ring in my ears.  He always reminded me of a piece of wisdom I want to share with you: </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody knows anything in this field.</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By that he means… nobody </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">knows</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for certain what is going to happen.  If we truly did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">know</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the future, we’d never have to work again.  We could all leverage up, pick the winners, and make so much money our eyes would glaze over.  But we </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> know the future.  That’s why we spend so much time crafting diversified portfolios and picking the right amount of risk for each individual’s unique tolerance.  Face it: you’re probably not going to achieve your daydream of being the protagonist of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Short </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who calls the financial crisis before it happens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have to understand that the difference of opinion is what makes a market exist.  Don’t forget that there is an incremental seller for each and every buyer in the market.  Right when you’re convinced to buy a security, someone else is convinced to sell.  That is just how it works.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplest thing to do is to remain calm and stick to your plan.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we use broad-based financial planning that is designed around your unique risk tolerance and your goals.  Unless it directly affects your financial plan, ignore the noise in the markets and that nagging voice in the back of your mind that screams sell every time you read a negative piece of news.  </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I might be new here, but I can predict the future just as well as the next guy.

Journal </span><a href=\"http://on.wsj.com/2ePYDpa\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that hackers had gained access to some of the systems of Equifax Inc., one of the largest three credit reporting companies, potentially compromising the personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers.  The systems they gained access to contained customers’ names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and addresses.  These four pieces of information are generally needed for consumers to apply for many forms of consumer credit, including credit cards and personal loans.  This raises the risk of fraud, as it means the hackers could have an easier time getting approved for credit under someone else’s name.  In addition to this information, credit card numbers, driver&#8217;s licenses, and dispute documents with sensitive information could have been compromised for some users.  Because Equifax gets its data from credit card companies, banks, retailers and lenders,</span><b> you could be affected regardless of whether or not you have ever knowingly provided them information</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is being called one of the largest and most threatening data breaches of recent years.  We encourage everyone to make sure they are protected and to closely monitor their credit for identity theft.  Equifax has set up a </span><a href=\"http://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help consumers determine if their information has been compromised.  One also can call their dedicated call center for consumers at 1-866-447-7559.  The company offers credit-monitoring and identity-theft protection products to guard consumers’ personal information.  Consumers can also protect themselves by immediately placing </span><a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fraud alerts on their credit reports</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  This means that a lender must contact you to verify your identity before it issues credit in your name for the next 90 days.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions, don’t

move into a new home, which needless to say, has been a chaotic process.  It really got me thinking, though, about real estate/home ownership and how it fits into client portfolios and their financial plans.</p>\n<h2>The mantra of the middle class is <em>buy a home</em>.  But is it always the best decision for your money?</h2>\n<p>Buying residential real estate certainly poses some undeniable advantages.  For many people, there is a certain pride in homeownership.  After all, it is the epitome of the American Dream.  Additionally, the interest and property tax portion of your mortgage is tax-deductible, and not unimportantly, homes tend to increase in value, build equity and provide a nest egg for the future.</p>\n<p>But what is very often overlooked by the average American is the opportunity cost of their money and how their mortgages play a role in that.  A recent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/is-money-in-the-bank-always-the-smarter-bet-1503662401\">Wall Street Journal article</a> highlights the important decision individuals face when they have excess cash.  It recommends taking a close look at what interest rates you pay on a mortgage and how those compare to the savings amount on your bank account as well as the rate of return on investments in equity and bonds.</p>\n<p>When homeowners do this, they often are struck with a revelation: they are likely not getting as high of a return on their investment as they would have if they were invested more heavily in equity.  Ultimately, the opportunity cost of having your money tied up in your mortgage could actually hurt your long-term wealth.  Even worse, the tax breaks you are receiving do not cover the amount of loss incurred from your interest rate!  A recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-28/how-the-top-1-keeps-getting-richer\">Bloomberg article</a> went so far to say that this simple understanding is one of the distinctions that separates the world’s wealthiest individuals from the middle class and one of the major contributing factors to income inequality.  Basically, it argues that a major difference between the middle class and the top 1% is that the middle class have too much of their portfolios tied in up residential real estate that is not providing adequate returns.</p>\n<p>There is a theory out there that wealthy individuals are simply more skilled investors.  A <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2706207\">recent study</a> explains that this is not true. (In fact, they might be worse!)  Wealthy people just tend to own most of the equity in the economy, meaning that when business does well, they reap disproportionately large benefits.  Generally speaking, rich individuals own the upside of the economy in the form of stock, while the middle class’s gains are limited by the slow growth of housing wealth.  It is no surprise that the collapse of the housing bubble has exacerbated wealth inequality because stocks recovered more strongly than real estate did.  Maybe the difference between you and the 1% is just your perception of the options available to you.</p>\n<p>Surely, shelter is one of the basic necessities of life.  Everyone has to live somewhere &#8211; but taking the time to consider all of your options before making any large financial decisions is something that every person should do.  At the very least, you should consider the opportunity costs of your cash and look into advantages of a less expensive housing option, renting, or investing more in equity to ensure that you are getting the most out of your money in the long run.</p>\n<h2>At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe that real life decisions call for real life financial planning.</h2>\n<p>These are the kinds of decisions we want to help you make, so don’t hesitate to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">contact us</a> today to get started.</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

That strikes us as a conflict that is unmanageable and ultimately, comes at the cost of the client.</p>\n<p>In the fallout of the financial crisis, regulators have tried to step in over the last decade to ensure that the world of retirement advice acts without conflicts of interest, specifically by holding all financial advisors to a status of “fiduciary.”  It means that these advisors who have potential conflicts of interest will have to increase their disclosures and explain what they do for clients as it relates to advice on retirement assets.  These advisors are upset!  While they might not admit it, they are concerned that this new rule will affect their income.  The increased pressure these advisors are putting on the administration has resulted in the <a href=\"https://t.co/aOnA0Rwdda\">Labor Department seeking an 18-month delay in its implementation</a>.  While the rule is designed to protect the retirement savings of clients, the pushback could ultimately cause the rule to never get implemented.</p>\n<p>So again, where do you as a client fall in this equation?  Just how valuable is your “trusted” relationship?</p>\n<p>That is where we come in.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we have always been a fee-only fiduciary.  That means while competitors are off arguing about fees, disclosures and conflicts of interest, we already subscribe to the status of “fiduciary” and will remain unaffected by the changes.  We provide uncompromised advice and our compensation is not based on commissions or any salesmanship of a product.  The only thing we are “selling” is our best customized advice for your unique financial situation.  We believe that working with an advisor who is already committed to functioning in your best interest will give you peace of mind about your retirement savings.</p>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">reach out</a> to us anytime with questions or comments.  Unlike Matilda’s Mrs. Trunchbull, you won’t have to hunt us down.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

underestimate the adjective.</h3>\n<p>In today’s world, the rise of “robo advisors” have led some to (incorrectly) conclude that managing investment portfolios is simple.  As far as they are concerned, as long as you have a software program, you’re set.  Within minutes, a computer system can analyze your risk tolerance, determine the best investments for your unique situation and be setup to adjust it every three months if it falls out of line.  These programs provide low cost access to data-driven algorithms for trading.  We’ve discussed some of the pros and cons in our recent <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<h3>But there is something missing if that is where the finance conversation stopped.</h3>\n<p>A glance at the <a href=\"https://www.behaviorgap.com/\">Behavior Gap</a> chart below points out the simple but incredibly valuable missing link: your lifetime returns are driven much more substantially by your own behavior than by the portfolio you have set up.  This is where the financial advisor steps in, because managing <em><u>you</u></em> and crafting plans

behavioral finance seeks to identify common biases that humans make when investing, including but not limited to: herd mentality, loss aversion, confirmation bias, availability bias, the disposition effect, familiarity bias and self attribution bias.  These are just some of the many important behavioral issues that the human connection you have with an advisor can help you avoid.</p>\n<p>A computer program cannot tell you that you are overreacting to a report you read on the news, or explain that chasing returns is likely not going to provide a benefit.  A computer program can’t coach you through identifying personal goals or customize budgets that will grow and change as unexpected life events pop-up.  A computer program isn’t going to give you a call when they see a red-flag in your budget or spending habits.  A computer program can’t push you to think beyond a limited scope to identify all of your goals and priorities or be there to answer the phone when you have a question.  For example: Do you want to send your kids to private school?  Do you want to be there to support your parents as they age?</p>\n<p>Don’t get us wrong: that hardly means you should shun technology.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe that a good financial advisor knows how to take the power that technology has to offer and add in all of the benefits that only a personal human connection can provide.  We believe that a good financial advisor is someone that you know and trust, who takes your financial plan as seriously as they would their own.  Here, we utilize a user-tech interface that allows our clients to manage all of the pieces of their financial plan, from cash flow to 401Ks, while allowing an experienced advisor to monitor it for new opportunities and to ensure clients are on the path to meet their goals.  That means you get access to all of their knowledge and expertise in combination with the power of technology to enhance returns, increase efficiency and provide you with flexibility and control.   As a fee-only fiduciary, we take that responsibility very seriously, and that includes taking advantage of all of the tools at our disposal.</p>\n<p>Do you feel that you are getting what you need out of your advisory relationship?  If not, we encourage you to reach out to us at anytime <a

Sherman Wealth Management’s approach is based on the understanding that personal finance should be just that&#8230; <em><u>personal</u></em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Gratified? Anxious? Indifferent? How much would you say your advisor has contributed to your sense of emotional and financial well being?</p>\n<p>Most of us probably don’t ask ourselves those questions and yet, according to a 2016 Morningstar study, <a href=\"http://images.mscomm.morningstar.com/Web/MorningstarInc/%7bb87a29d4-9264-4e6f-a5d7-5e65f8714f92%7d_US_ADV_MoreLess_Whitepaper_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">When More Is Less: Rethinking Financial Health</a>, our sense of well being is an important element to consider when thinking about wealth management and financial planning.</p>\n<p>A simple way to look at financial well being is that it&#8217;s the ability to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fully meet your current and ongoing financial obligations</li>\n<li>Feel secure about your financial future</li>\n<li>Make choices that allow you to enjoy life</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Seen that way, it’s clear how feeling secure financially can contribute to our overall emotional well being as well.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <em>not</em> having a sense of overall <em>emotional</em> well being can have a negative, sabotaging effect on our financial well being, via decisions driven by anxiety, fear, insecurity, or some common behavioral biases.</p>\n<h2>Which comes first, emotional or financial well being?</h2>\n<p>The short answer is that either can.</p>\n<p>While health, family, and friends are the most important things in life, we all know that feeling anxious financially can affect our important relationships. And we know that having a sense of financial well being can give us peace of mind that lets us more fully enjoy the life and relationships we have.</p>\n<p>We also know that emotional well being &#8211; feeling emotionally secure and supported &#8211; can ground us so that we make better, more measured financial decisions. And that emotional distress can lead us to make reckless, impulsive, or biased decisions that can negatively affect achieving a secure and prosperous future.</p>\n<h2>What kinds of behaviors can derail financial well being?</h2>\n<p>Behavioral Science researchers have identified many simple yet critical attitudes and biases that can keep us from acting in our own best interest. Unconscious biases that can wreck havoc with financial well being include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The tendency for investors to react more strongly to negative news than to positive news</li>\n<li>Placing more weight – positive or negative &#8211; on current news than on the big picture</li>\n<li>A “herd mentality” that leads investors to follow the crowd, buying securities at their peak prices as a result</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What’s the first step in achieving financial well being?</h2>\n<p>A good first step towards achieving financial well being is becoming aware of the role that our emotions and biases may be playing in our financial decisions, choices, and habits. Think about your financial choices and some of the last few big financial decisions you made: were there emotions involved, however subtly, that may have influence your choices? A good Financial Advisor, particularly one well versed in Behavioral Finance, can be enormously helpful. “By identifying specific patterns of thought that may sabotage a client’s overall financial health,’” writes Sarah Newcomb, Ph.D., a behavioral scientist for Morningstar, “an advisor can help guide clients into making better financial decisions and increase their satisfaction and peace of mind.”</p>\n<p>An added benefit of identifying some of the emotions or biases that may be driving financial decisions: some of my clients have told me that discovering a bias that has affected their financial decisions has lead them to understand other ways that same bias has been affecting their life as well!</p>\n<p>Nothing beats a sense of well being, and feeling more secure financially definitely contributes to a greater overall sense of well being and peace of mind. And emotional wellbeing – along with a good financial advisor &#8211; can keep you from sabotaging your own progress, and put you back in control and on your way to achieving your financial goals.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

According to a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/podcasts/how-much-do-you-really-pay-your-financial-adviser/D6E453D8-C530-4029-B99B-7821F499F3B2.html\">recent podcast</a> from the Wall Street Journal, it’s not only <em>how much</em> you pay – but also what you are paying <em>for</em> – that’s a source of communication breakdown between those clients and their advisors.</p>\n<p>While the Department of Labor is pushing to get advisors and brokers to make it easier for clients to understand their fee structures, so far it doesn’t look like many of the bigger firms are taking them up on it.</p>\n<p>Since any firm or advisor can <em>claim</em> to be client-driven, transparent, and “fee-based,” how can you be completely sure about what you’re getting and how much you’re paying? If your advisor is fee-based, rather than strictly fee-only, they may be earning commissions when they recommend certain investment products. Obviously, that creates a potential conflict of interest: those advisors have incentives to trade more frequently, and to recommend specific products in order to generate higher commissions for themselves and their firm, whether or not they’re best for you.</p>\n<p>One way to avoid uncertainty – and the potential headaches it brings – is to work with a <em>fee-only</em> registered investment advisory firm (RIA). Fee-only RIAs and advisors do not earn commissions so they are <em>not</em> motivated by the frequency of trades, so they are less likely to encourage buying and selling unless it’s the best choice for you. Because RIAs are held to a fiduciary standard, they are legally bound to always – and only &#8211; act in your best interest.</p>\n<h2>Do your advisor&#8217;s feed include additional services?</h2>\n<p>Even if you are working with a fee-only RIA, however, you may be still not getting your full money’s worth. Many clients neglect to take advantage of untapped services that are included in their advisor’s fees, such as tax and estate planning, insurance advice, and financial coaching, among other services. If you’re not sure what additional services your advisor – or the advisors you are considering – provide, ask them. It’s the best way to ensure that there’s an open path of communication and that you are getting the most value out of your wealth management experience.</p>\n<p>Only you can decide what kind of fee structure is best for you, what you feel is the appropriate amount to spend on investment management and financial planning, and what additional services are important to you to help you grow your wealth.</p>\n<p>If you’re concerned you’re not getting your money’s worth, though, or that you’re paying too much, here are some good questions to ask yourself: How adequately served do you think you are? Are you confused with what services you are getting and what you are paying for? Do you feel valued? Are your goals being met and are you being listened to?</p>\n<p>If you’re not satisfied with the answers to any of these questions, remember that you have options. Sherman Wealth Management is proud to be a fee-only independent RIA firm, because we feel it is the best way to meet our ethical standards and guarantee that all potential clients have a simple and cost-effective way to access investment management and financial planning.</p>\n<p>Knowing what those options are, and getting clarity in your fee structures – whatever kind of advisor you ultimately choose &#8211; will allow you to feel more confident about the decisions you make, now and for your future.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/are-you-getting-you-moneys-worth-financial-advice/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Sound like a hard idea to sell to kids in vacation mode? Not if you make it a rewarding part of summer fun. Here are some tips to incorporate smart money lessons for kids from K-12 that will add to their summer fun and set a great foundation for making smart money choices later on.</p>\n<h3>SAVING</h3>\n<p>Ask your kids to set aside part their allowance for a special summer savings goal then sweeten the pot by telling them you’ll match whatever they save. For the little ones it could be as simple as setting up 2 jars, one for their summer goal (like a super-soaker, hula hoop, or the ingredients for s’mores) and one for the rest of their allowance. They’ll love seeing the jars fill up with coins and counting and re-counting their money. For older kids who are saving for a concert ticket or a tattoo (just kidding!), an app or a website that keeps track of their savings and your matching funds is a great way of getting them interested.</p>\n<h3>EARNING</h3>\n<p>Nothing like learning the satisfaction of having your “own” money! Even if your older children have an actual summer job, consider “hiring” them for extra chores like organizing your photo files, digitizing old cassettes and CDs, or washing the windows. For the little ones, watering plants, pulling up 20 weeds (counting skills!) or helping you rinse the car can help add their allowance jars.</p>\n<h3>INVESTING</h3>\n<p>There are fun games to teach kids of all ages about the stock market, investing, and the power of compound interest (like <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media/game-0007-invest-quest\">InvestQuest</a> from the FTC.) The best way of course, though, is to follow the real stock market. Why not have every family member invest a virtual $1000 in 2 companies whose products they know at the beginning of the summer (Lego and Disney for the younger kids, for instance) and see who ends up with the most virtual profit by the end of the summer. Or, if you have the resources, open accounts for the kids with real investments, however small, so they can watch them go up and down, while earning interest, over the months and years ahead. The SEC&#8217;s site <a href=\"https://investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator\">Investor.gov</a> has a great compound interest generator to show kids how their money could grow.</p>\n<h3>SPENDING</h3>\n<p>Summer is also a great time to teach kids about comparison shopping, supply and demand, and the power of buying things when they are on sale. Keeping track of what you save each time you buy a sale-priced item this summer can be an eye-opening for your kids. As you enjoy vacation trips, or even day trips to waterparks, let your kids know about the <em>value</em> you are getting (rather than complaining about high prices.) Give the kids a choice when possible, telling them how much you have to spend for the day and ask their input about how to spend it. When they know that buying cotton candy means they are giving up two rides they learn a valuable lesson about resource allocation!</p>\n<h3>READING</h3>\n<p>Find great books to read or listen to in the car about entrepreneurs’ success stories. Young children will enjoy books about Thomas Edison, for instance, or Alexander Who Used to Be Rich Last Sunday. Try a biography of Steve Jobs for the teens, or check out finance videos from Khan Academy.</p>\n<h3>PAYING</h3>\n<p>Take a moment to explain what you’re paying for when you’re paying bills: show your kids how the electric bills soar in the summer if you’re use air conditioning or your water bill if you’re watering the lawn. Calculate – or Google &#8211; how much it costs when they leave lights on. Not exactly entertaining but an empowering eye-opener for kids.</p>\n<h3>PLAYING</h3>\n<p>Nothing like a great game of Monopoly to while away summer nights while teaching kids about saving up for those houses and hotels (including our favorite trick: hiding money under the board so no one sees how much you are accumulating!)</p>\n<p>In short, if you treat money matter-of-factly &#8211; and build in some challenges, competition, and entertainment &#8211; summer can be a great time to sneak in a little fun “schooling” that will help prepare kids for an empowered future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * * * *</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

For parents of younger children, however, those happy announcements may make them wonder if they are being savvy about starting to save for college.</p>\n<p>One thing any parent will tell you is that time flies. Before you know it, your toddler will be taking the SATs. And one thing any financial advisor will tell you is that the earlier you start <em>any</em> savings plan, the better off you’ll be (although any time is better than no time.)</p>\n<h2><strong>Not all college savings plans are created equal</strong></h2>\n<p>The good news is that more parents than ever are already saving, including an impressive 65% of young millennial parents, according to Sallie Mae’s 2016 report <em>How America Saves for College</em>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, 61% of the parents surveyed said they are putting their savings in regular savings accounts, and a whopping 44% of all money saved is held in savings &amp; checking accounts, CDs, savings bonds and other low-yielding instruments. And too many of the non-savers are hoping that earnings from their own investments or savings will cover college.</p>\n<p>So what are the best ways to save for your child’s education?</p>\n<h2><strong>Better Ways to Save &#8211; 529s, ESAs, and UTMAs</strong></h2>\n<p>With the availability of excellent plans with significant tax benefits and the potential for compound interest gains, why are so few parents taking advantage of them? One reason may be that the various plans, while excellent, are not always easy to understand. Even the alphabet soup of names is daunting when you’re also worried about packing lunches, soccer practice, and missing work for parent teacher conferences.</p>\n<p>Here’s a simplified look at the top plans:</p>\n<h2><strong>529 Plans</strong></h2>\n<p>While 529 plans have been around since 1996, they still seem to be a well-kept secret, with only 22% of college savings invested in these portfolios of investment funds (here too, savvy Millennials are leading the charge with 44% planning to take advantage of 529 plans, while Gen X and Baby Boomer parents trail at 36% and 23%.)</p>\n<p>529 plans are offered by each of the 50 states and allow you deposit post-tax money that grows and compounds tax-free. While you can invest in any state’s plan, investing in your own state’s plan may offer state income tax deductions in addition to the federal tax break for earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Anyone can create a 529 account (including the future student) and anyone can add up to $14,000 per year to the account (or $28,000 if married) without paying a federal gift tax. Up to a total of $400,000 can be invested in a 529 plan account per beneficiary (each state sets its own limits) and for most plans there is no age restriction for the beneficiary. <span id=\"UXUtVblr\" class=\"zgmOJOUauG\">They also allow withdrawals to pay for educational supplies such as computers and books, and the account owner can change the beneficiary to another eligible family member if the funds aren’t used.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks</strong>: when you invest in a state plan, you do not control the financial decisions. Instead, you invest in the portfolio of funds offered by the plan. So shop around for the state plan you feel most comfortable with and that best matches your risk tolerance (a good Fiduciary Financial Advisor can help you evaluate the choices.)</p>\n<h2><strong>Coverdell Educational Savings Accounts (ESAs)</strong></h2>\n<p>ESA accounts are similar to a 529 plan in that you contribute post-tax money then growth in value is tax-free. Unlike 529 plans, however, you are free to invest the money as you please.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> You control the investments in the account and, like 529 plans, can use the funds to pay for educational supplies such as computers and books. You can also use ESA funds to pay for K-12 costs if your child goes to a private school. Any funds not used, may be rolled, tax-free, into the ESA of another family member.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks:</strong> Contributions are capped at $2000 per year per beneficiary and must come from contributors whose adjusted gross income for that year is less than $110,000 (or $220,000 for individuals filing joint returns) so this option is not available to higher income contributors. The beneficiary must be under 18 when it the ESA is created and funded, and the funds must be used by age 30 or be subject to federal tax and a 10% penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong>UGMA/UTMA Custodial Accounts</strong></h2>\n<p>The UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Act) and UTMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) allow larger gifts to be made to minors, while still qualifying for gift tax exclusion. They allow a parent or grandparent to reduce their estate for tax purposes with greater flexibility in how the money is invested than a 529 offers.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Custodial accounts have the greatest flexibility. You can contribute as much as you want, invest it as you please, and &#8211; while 529 accounts and ESAs are exclusively intended for education expenses &#8211; funds in a custodial accounts can be used for any purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks:</strong> Unlike 529 plans and ESAs, the earnings are not tax-free. And, while custodian controls how the funds are used while the student is a minor, after the student turns 21 (or 18 in some states,) control is transferred to the student. Another important consideration for both taxes and financial aid applications is that custodial accounts are considered the child’s assets and the income they produce (over $1,050 and up to $2,100) will be taxed as income to the child, then any earnings beyond that are taxed at your rate.</p>\n<h2><strong>Prepaid tuition plans</strong></h2>\n<p>If you live in a state with excellent state schools, prepaid tuition plans may be a smart solution for you. Administered by the individual states, these investment accounts allow you to pay for – or contribute to &#8211; your child&#8217;s future state school tuition at today&#8217;s rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Paying now is a great hedge against rising college costs and the increase in value is not taxed.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks</strong>: The funds can only be used at state schools and do not cover room and board.</p>\n<h2><strong>Get a head start on your child’s financial education too</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve chose the plan – or combination &#8211; that makes the most sense for you, it’s a smart idea to share your investment plan with your child, as soon as they&#8217;re old enough to understand. If you get them started early understanding the power of planning, saving, and compound interest, they’ll already have an A+ in financial literacy when they get into the college of their dreams.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\"><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/advisors/54337/brad-sherman/\">Investopedia</a>.</em></div>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This was clearly good news for investors. Adoption has now been delayed, however, and the future of this consumer protection is not clear.</p>\n<h2>Fiduciary means “Trust”</h2>\n<p>The word “Fiduciary” (from a the Latin word for “something inspiring trust”) describes a category of registered independent investment advisors who – like Sherman Wealth &#8211; are required to act <em>solely</em> and <em>exclusively</em> in the best interest of their clients. Our decisions are not colored by any expectation of additional income from the products we recommend.</p>\n<h2>Don’t all advisors work in their clients best interests?</h2>\n<p>Not necessarily. While it seems obvious that giving you the best advice is what you expect your advisor to do – it’s what you <u>pay</u> them for after all &#8211; broker-dealers are not required to operate as fiduciaries.</p>\n<p>Broker-dealers have only been required to recommend products that are deemed a “suitable” choice for a client, not necessarily the <em>best</em> choice. Broker dealers can therefore recommend investments they receive commissions for selling or that their firm has an interest in, <em>whether or not they are the best choice for you.</em></p>\n<p>Let’s put it this way: as long as their recommendations are <em>in </em>the ballpark, they don’t have to aim for hitting it <em>out of</em> the park for you.</p>\n<h2>The new fiduciary rule should be a win-win, right?</h2>\n<p>Again, not necessarily. The new rule, which was passed under the previous administration, was set to go into effect this week and would have required the widespread adoption of the fiduciary rule for investment accounts and assets.</p>\n<p>That would have given investors greater protection and greater confidence in the advice they are getting from their advisors.</p>\n<p>The DOL has delayed the date of adoption until June 9, however, as the result of an executive order by the new administration. The current administration says it needs time to examine and review it, given, among other things, the Financial Industry’s concerns about costs to them, including the money they are earning on commissions from clients like you.</p>\n<h2>How does this affect your Financial Future?</h2>\n<p>If you are already working with a fiduciary, not at all. You are already covered, for <em>all</em> aspects of your investments, not just retirement funds.</p>\n<p>If you are <em>not</em> already with a fiduciary advisor, even if the new rule is adopted in some form or another, it only applies to retirement investments and potentially not the full spectrum of your investing strategy, so you are still not getting the most transparent, trustworthy advice you can.</p>\n<h2>What should you do to insure you’re getting conflict-free advice?</h2>\n<p>Find out if your investor is a fee-only Fiduciary. Ask them. They are required to tell you. And don’t be fooled by “fee-based.” A true fiduciary does not take commissions and is conflict-of-interest free.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the DOL will act in the best interest of consumers and investors. Even if the future of the new ruling is unclear, you can protect yourself by working with one of the many advisories that has – like Sherman Wealth &#8211; <em>already</em> adopted the Fiduciary Standard for all investment categories.</p>\n<p>At Sherman Wealth we are proud to operate as fee-only fiduciaries, which means that our decisions are based on <em>your</em> goals, <em>your</em> risk tolerance, and <em>your</em> plan. Nothing more and nothing less.

Don’t start to build from the roof down, though: make sure that you’re laying a strong financial foundation.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/8-financial-mistakes-avoid-20s-30s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our last post</a> we talked about 8 Financial Mistakes to Avoid in Your 20s and 30s. Here are five more money mistakes to watch out for:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Going on a Financial Blind Date With Your Significant Other: Not Having the Money Talk First</strong></h4>\n<p>Talking about money isn’t romantic and can be downright uncomfortable. That’s why many couples go into marriage—a financial partnership—without knowing exactly who they are partnering with. Discussing personal finances, debt, goals, spending patterns and how you make financial decisions with your partner before marriage, or soon thereafter, is critical to your short- and long-term financial health. (For related reading, see: Don&#8217;t Let Financial Differences Lead to Divorce.)</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Living la Vida Loca: Splurging on the Wedding or a Baby</strong></h4>\n<p>Important milestones like a wedding, a first child or even your first house are exciting and make precious memories that last a lifetime. But be careful not to let them put you in debt or divert you from a financial plan that allows you to make other great memories down the road. Know what you can afford, get creative within your budget, and make sure you’re investing in your partner’s and children’s future as well. The kids won’t mind—or even remember—that you didn’t buy them that top-of-the-line stroller. What they’ll remember is your smile and their favorite red ball. #Priceless</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Not Buckling Your Seat Belt: Neglecting Insurance</strong></h4>\n<p>It’s tempting to skimp on insurance once you’ve covered your basic health and homeowner’s policies, but that’s a big mistake many young adults make. Insurance is an uncomfortable topic—and the options can be very confusing—so covering yourself with health, life, car, home, disability and long-term disability insurance often gets put on the back burner. Cover yourself adequately now so that when the unexpected happens, it’s not a financial disaster. (For related reading, see: Introduction to Insurance.)</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Going for the Gold: Taking a Job for the Pay</strong></h4>\n<p>While a great offer is always tempting, make sure that any job you take is something that will advance you in the direction you want to go. Don&#8217;t take a job just because the money is great, although that’s important too. If you do, you could get stuck in a job you don’t love with nowhere to go. Take a job that is going to move you closer to the job you want—and the even-higher salary you want—in a couple of years.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Putting Too Many Eggs in the Wrong Basket: Not Prioritizing Savings</strong></h4>\n<p>Maxing out your 401(k) or IRA is smart, but don’t forget to save for other major purchases that may be coming up sooner than you think, like buying a new home, having children, or continuing your education. Multiple savings accounts can be a great way to keep your eye on multiple baskets! Be careful, too, not to prioritize your children’s education over saving for your own retirement. Student loans are less expensive than the kind of loans your kids would have to take out to support you if you haven’t set enough savings aside to support your own retirement.</p>\n<p>Enjoy this special time, living your life to the fullest. If you make sure you&#8217;re also making smart financial choices, you&#8217;ll <em>really</em> enjoy your 20s and 30s, knowing that you&#8217;re building a solid future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You’re starting to build the life you envision for yourself, or perhaps you’re still seeking out new experiences to learn more about yourself and your goals.</p>\n<p>These are years when we expect to learn and grow by exploring jobs and careers, cultural experiences, social experiences and other educational opportunities. But too many of us forget to explore and master one of the most critical parts of building the future we want: financial literacy and financial planning.</p>\n<p>The result is that many people enjoy their 20s and make important life changes in their 30s (or vice versa) without understanding how best to support their career and personal goals with a rock-solid financial plan. You could end up flying high, but forget to build a safety net!</p>\n<p>Here are some key mistakes to avoid as you’re getting started:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. </strong><strong>Letting the Chips Fall Where They May: No Budget</strong></h4>\n<p>A first job—or second, or third—is a great feeling. You’re earning money and it’s yours to spend. And too often, we spend it until it’s gone. While a budget may sound restrictive, it actually gives you more freedom because it keeps you from overspending in areas you don’t care about so you have the money you need for what’s important. <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/120816/3-ways-make-budgeting-success-new-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A budget helps you understand where to splurge</a>—on quality that lasts longer, for instance—and where it’s best to economize, such as buying a used car instead of a new one.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Keeping Too Low of a Profile: No Credit Rating</strong></h4>\n<p>Many people just starting out have low credit ratings, or worse, no credit rating at all (if you’ve always used your parents credit cards, for instance). With a low credit score, your costs will be higher for things like insurance, car financing and mortgage rates. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building good credit now</a>, by getting your own credit card and paying it diligently, or even getting a credit-building loan, will establish a good rating that will help you down the road.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Putting It off Until Tomorrow: Living on Credit Cards</strong></h4>\n<p>Credit cards can be a godsend, particularly the ones with loyalty points. But those points pale in value beside the damage that finance charges can do. Do treat your credit cards like a smart way to keep track of your spending, but don’t spend more than you actually have. Paying credit cards off in full each month not only keeps you within your budget and keeps you from accruing finance charges, it also helps you build a great credit rating for when you do need to borrow money. (For related reading, see: 10 Reasons to Use Your Credit Card.)</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Living on Perks Instead of Salary: Not Paying Yourself First</strong></h4>\n<p>We’ve all been to that job interview where they say that the salary is low but they have a great exercise room, volleyball team and popcorn machine. That popcorn won’t pay the rent and it won’t pay a down payment when you find that great condo. Create a savings plan and pay yourself first before you splurge on lifestyle perks like vacations and expensive shoes. That plan should include saving for short-term goals, saving for an emergency fund, and starting to save for retirement. While retirement may seem a long way off, the earlier you start, the more you harness the power of compound interest. Make sure your budget includes saving and contributing, on a regular basis no matter how small the amount, to an IRA or 401(k) before you start spending.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Living on the Edge: No Emergency Fund</strong></h4>\n<p>While it’s hard to imagine needing emergency funds when you’re young and just starting out, you never know what the future can bring. Crises like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 crash left a lot of people struggling without a safety net, but even something as simple as a pet’s sudden illness can present a huge challenge when you’re on a tight budget. Try to start contributing to an emergency fund that you keep in highly liquid funds for when the unexpected happens. (For related reading, see: Building an Emergency Fund.)</p>\n<h4><strong>6. Playing the Odds: No Health Insurance</strong></h4>\n<p>Many young people who are in peak health think that they can skip—or skimp—on health insurance. While you may indeed be fit and healthy, that doesn’t protect you from potential sports injuries, appendicitis, bouts with the flu or—perish the thought—a car accident. High medical bills are the biggest cause of personal bankruptcy. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/back-basics-insurance-cheat-sheet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get the best coverage you can afford</a>: you’ll be amazed how quickly it pays for itself.</p>\n<h4><strong>7. Going With the Flow: Not Setting Financial Goals</strong></h4>\n<p>“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you’re heading,” goes the famous quote attributed to Lao Tzu. That means it’s a good idea to think about where you’d like to be—in a year, in five years, in 20 years—and make sure that’s the path you’re on. Simple goals like “I want to save $20.00 a week,” or more elaborate ones, like “I’d like to work for myself from a house on the beach,” all begin with awareness and taking the first small steps. <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/100616/dont-let-emotions-hinder-your-investing-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Set a few goals</a>; you can always change them later, but if you don’t, you’re drifting without being mindful of where the currents are taking you.</p>\n<h4><strong>8. Taking Your Eye off the Ball: Using a Non-Fiduciary Advisor or Commission-Based Investment Site</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/age_vs_risk_tolerance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">It’s never too late</a> to become financially literate. The internet is full of great tips (like these) and sites that can help you organize your finances, and it provides access to a range of advisories. Having a financial advisor guide you is an excellent idea but blindly trusting just anyone can be dangerous. Many non-fiduciary advisors are compensated by the financial products they recommend, products that may not be the best ones for you. Make sure the advisor you consult is a fiduciary, i.e. someone who is legally obligated to only recommend options that are in your best interest.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our next post: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-more-financial-mistakes/\">5 More Financial Mistakes to Avoid</a>.

The increase in the banks’ rate is then passed on to <em>their</em> borrowers, through climbing interest rates on things like credit-card debt, car loans, home equity loans and mortgages.</p>\n<p>This means borrowers may already be feeling a small, but still noteworthy pinch, when it comes to interest on their loans.</p>\n<p>No need to panic though: it doesn&#8217;t need to mean turbulent waters ahead. Taking a look at whether your own financial goals and strategies need to be adjusted will help you stay on track for your own future.</p>\n<h3>How will the hike affect you?</h3>\n<p>The relationship between the economy and interest rates is so complex that even experts sometimes find it daunting. That said, there are a few key action items to consider when interest rates start to rise:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong> 1. Refinancing options for existing loans</strong></p>\n<p>It might be time to consider refinancing to lock into current rates before they begin increasing, including rates on your mortgage, home equity loan, and car loans. Make sure you know which of your loans are adjustable or floating, and discuss with your advisor on what your options are to potentially minimize any increasing costs.</p>\n<p><strong> 2. Your debt payoff strategy and schedule</strong></p>\n<p>Do the math and decide whether it makes sense to reallocate funds and increase your monthly debt payments. By paying more on your loans you reduce the principal quicker and therefore accrue less interest payments over the life of the loan. Your financial advisor may suggest that your investment gains may still offer the potential to offset any interest rate increase however there are many things to consider before making any adjustments (see our risk tolerance point below).</p>\n<p><strong> 3. Bank and credit card balance transfers </strong></p>\n<p>It is always a good idea to shop around for the most favorable credit card and bank rates, particularly if interest rates are about to rise.</p>\n<p><strong> 4. Your risk tolerance</strong></p>\n<p>It is a great time to sit down with your financial advisor and determine whether the level of risk you are comfortable with has changed in light of an expectation of rising interest rates and determine if it is time to rebalance your portfolio or make any adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong> 5. Your budget </strong></p>\n<p>Rising interest rates and a strengthening economy may lead to an increase in the prices for everyday items including gas, groceries, and entertainment. Take a look at your spending and make any adjustments necessary so that you can stay on track with your savings plan.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What’s the good news?</h3>\n<p>By raising rates, the Fed is signaling its confidence that the economy is strengthening, which is great news if you have clearly defined goals and a diversified portfolio.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for these possible benefits:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong> 1. Interest rates on your savings accounts could increase</strong></p>\n<p>While banks tend to raise interest rates on deposits more slowly than on loans, you may see the interest rates applied to your savings accounts increase over time.</p>\n<p><strong> 2. Incentives to buy a home now</strong></p>\n<p>The specter of rising rates could be just the incentive you need to switch from renting to owning your own home.</p>\n<p><strong> 3. Increasing employment rates and salaries</strong></p>\n<p>The Fed has communicated that it believes the economy will continue to improve and that &#8220;labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.&#8221; That is good news because continued growth could mean more jobs and rising wages.</p>\n<p><strong> 4. More business</strong></p>\n<p>A more robust economy may also lead to more consumer confidence , driving more customers, clients, or contracts to your business and this additional business could offset the less desirable attributes of rising rates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Take a look, then take it in stride!</h3>\n<p>March’s rate hike, while small, was an indication that the Federal Reserve is slowly downshifting the stimulus policies it put in place after the financial crisis of 2008. It also indicates confidence that the economy is growing and will continue to grow, at least in the near future.</p>\n<p>Take a look at your savings plan, your investment portfolio, and your risk tolerance with your advisor, and see if you need to make any necessary adjustments.</p>\n<p>With proper diversification, goal-setting, and the help of a Fiduciary financial advisor, you can stay on track to achieving you and your family’s financial goals despite a potentially more costly borrowing environment.</p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

The statistics are alarming, but perhaps not surprising. How we handle money is not usually a topic of that comes up while we are dating. As a result most couples don’t discuss financial compatibility before saying “I do”. When the honeymoon is over, though, and the bills start rolling in, couples often experience a reality check. While love is grand, it can’t pay the bills so it may not take long before fights erupt over different money habits.</p>\n<p>Part of the problem is that it is simply uncomfortable to talk about money. Whether we like it or not, we tend to tie our own feelings of self-worth to money matters. It’s not uncommon to see how much money we make as a direct reflection of how much we are contributing to the relationship. These feelings can become further complicated if there have been financial missteps along the way. While avoiding conversations about money can allow us live in a blissful state of denial for a while, the long-term consequences can be life-altering.</p>\n<p>The good news is that it is never too late to make meaningful changes and save a marriage that is threatened by financial discord.</p>\n<p>According to financial planners who work with couples, money conflicts fall under five main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Differences in spending and saving habits</li>\n<li>Disagreements about who should control the money</li>\n<li>Differences in priorities</li>\n<li>Dishonesty about debt and habits</li>\n<li>Differences in risk profiles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you are experiencing frustration around one of these issues or all five, there are ways to build better financial health as a couple and avoid relationship problems.</p>\n<h2>Effective Communication Leads to Greater Financial Success</h2>\n<p>Effective communication can make a world of difference when it comes to financial matters. Establishing trust, which is cultivated through honest communication, is key. Trust is built when each partner commits to openly expressing their feelings about money and listening to what the other partner has to say. This includes being willing to reveal financial failures, knowing that your partner will be forgiving and withhold judgment.</p>\n<h2>Be Willing to Compromise</h2>\n<p>Although it is easier said than done, another key to resolving money issues is compromise. The first step is for both partners to sit down and agree on a common set of financial goals and what steps they will take to meet those mutual goals. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/3-ways-make-budgeting-success-new-year/\">Establishing a family budget</a> &#8211; and committing to it – is critical. That budget should include some freedom for spending on things that are important to both partners, regardless of who is earning more money.</p>\n<h2>Be Patient</h2>\n<p>As you begin the process of rehabilitating your financial health and establishing clear lines of communication with your partner, remember to be patient. Keep in mind that spending habits are deeply ingrained in each of us. Both you and your partner have been influenced by your parents’ habits and your approach to money has been formed over a lifetime of experiences.</p>\n<h2>Enlist the Help of a Financial Planner</h2>\n<p>Whether you need help mediating tough conversations or you want expert advice on how to establish a budget that will help you meet your financial goals, don’t try to go it alone. Work with a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">financial advisor</a> who can offer helpful insights and steer you in the right direction. With the right help, you can get back on track financially and strengthen your relationship. If you are to the point where money issues are creating such a strain on your marriage that you are considering divorce, outside intervention from an experienced financial advisor can be critically important in finding solutions that work for both of you.</p>\n<h2>Avoid Conflict</h2>\n<p>Often couples will argue about whether they should give or loan money to family members. While each case is different, and very personal, it is generally a good idea to try to avoid making these kinds of loans. Once that first loan is made, you have set a precedent and you are more than likely to receive follow-up request for additional money. While it can be difficult to say no to friends and family, it is always in your financial best interest to avoid these types of transactions.</p>\n<h2>A Happy Ending</h2>\n<p>Even in the best marriages, there are bound to be differences over finances, but those disagreements don’t have to drive a wedge between you and your partner, or worse, lead to divorce. If you actively work to establish trust through open and honest communication and recognize when it is time to seek outside help from a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor, you are taking important steps to letting your financial life be a solid foundation for your marriage – and not the wall between you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********</p>\n<h6><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://ow.ly/iMld309YGqU\">Investopedia</a>.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

While most people start families in their 20s or 30s, you might be that 40-year-old who’s just about to adopt a first child. And while most 60-year-olds have hopefully accumulated some retirement savings, you might be that entrepreneurial baby boomer who is moving to Detroit to launch a startup or open a coffee bar.</p>\n<p>In spite of this brave, and exciting, new world of personal choices, what’s the first question a financial advisor or online financial site generally asks you? Chances are it’s your age. Then that answer determines the next question, and the next.</p>\n<p>Too many financial planners and investment sites, unfortunately, use age to make assumptions that then dictate investment recommendations.</p>\n<p>The internet, too, is filled with articles like “Financial Planning Tips Every 30-year-old should know” and “The best financial goals for every age.” There are books and studies that break your life down into age-based phases like “early career phase” and “peak accumulation phase” then make generalization based on those neat buckets.</p>\n<h3><strong>What’s more important than age?</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re all individuals, with different dreams, goals, and life situations and when it comes to financial planning, age is not as important as it used to be.</p>\n<p>Your goals and your risk tolerance should be the factors to consider first in devising a personalized financial plan or investment plan that works for you.</p>\n<p>Is your primary goal buying a house, is it wealth creation for early retirement, is it having income so you can bike around the world for a year? Those answers are more important than the fact that you are 32.</p>\n<p>Does a volatile stock market make you anxious? Do you prefer slow and steady to winner takes all? While it’s generally assumed that young people can afford greater risk and volatility because they have time on their side, you may be that 24 year old that wants or needs to preserve savings first and foremost.</p>\n<p>Goals differ and investment always involves a certain amount of risk. That’s why a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor works with each client individually to manage goals and risk in a way that works for them. It is vital for success to determine the level of risk each client can afford to take, how much risk is necessary to help them achieve their personal goals, and how much risk and volatility they can comfortably live with emotionally.</p>\n<h3><strong>You Are Unique</strong></h3>\n<p>Each of us is unique and that means that no two people will have the exact same goals + risk profile, in spite of being the same age. Yes, living off retirement savings is different than living off a first salary, but the amount may be the same. And paying off student loans is really not all that different from paying off a mortgage.</p>\n<p>What’s important is that you find a good fee-only fiduciary financial advisor who looks beyond pre-programmed, one-size-fits all recommendations for 20-30 year-olds or 60+ year-olds and focuses to your goals, your risk preferences, and your uniqueness to create a personalized plan that works for you and evolves as you evolve, not one designed for an entire generation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/020617/your-financial-plan-depends-more-your-age/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You’re not alone. Financial planning jargon can be daunting when you’re just getting started.</p>\n<p>Understanding the difference between Fee-Only and Fee-Based, however, is important and could be the key to your long-term planning success.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Fee-Only Financial Planning?</strong></h2>\n<p>Fee-Only financial planners are legally registered as investment advisors and have a <em>fiduciary responsibility</em> to you to create a plan in your best interest. Fee-only advisors cannot accept any compensation as a result of product sales. In other words, they can’t make a commission from specific investments they recommend you purchase. They are paid directly by you – and only by you &#8211; either through an hourly fee, a retainer fee, or an agreed-upon percentage of your assets that they manage.</p>\n<p>As a result, in most cases, Fee-Only advisors have fewer conflicts of interest. They are more focused on <em>your</em> needs, rather than on selling you specific investments, since their compensation is not determined by sales volume or choice. A Fee-Only advisor will not try to steer you toward commissioned annuities; a Fee-Only planner’s advice must be completely free of attachment to financial products. The role of Fee-Only advisors is to only provide you advice that fits <em>your</em> current financial situation and your goals and therefore not recommend products and services that don’t support that goal and that are not the best choices for you.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Fee-Based Planning?</strong></h2>\n<p>“Fee-Based” is a category the brokerage community has created to take advantage of the success – and attractiveness &#8211; of Fee-Only advising. Because the terms sound so similar, it’s easy to think they are similar, but there is a major difference between Fee-Based planning and Fee-Only planning.</p>\n<p>In Fee-Based planning, the advisor is compensated with a set percentage of your assets instead of a retainer or a flat hourly fee. In addition to that percentage, Fee-based advisors can also accept commissions from financial products, annuities, and insurance products they sell you. Each time you purchase one of those products, their earnings increase.</p>\n<p>This leads to a fundamental conflict of interest. Your advisor wants to earn as much as possible while you want someone to provide honest and trustworthy guidance.</p>\n<p>If one fund offers advisors a significant commission and another one doesn’t but is better for you and your financial goals, how likely is it that the advisor will forego the opportunity to earn the commission by recommending the better fund?</p>\n<p>That is why the legally-binding Fiduciary Rule that Fee-Only Advisors follow is so important: the definition of a fiduciary relationship is one based on trust.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Make Sure Your Advisor is Fee-Only</strong></h2>\n<p>Before selecting an advisor, ask how and what their compensation plan looks like. Ask them to disclose what their compensation fees are in writing and whether or not they accept commissions. By choosing an advisor who provides Fee-Only services, you stand a greater chance of avoiding any conflicts of interests. Remember, Fee-Based advisors are obligated by their brokers or by specific deals to sell certain products. Fee-Only advisors are under no such requirements and have a legal, fiduciary, obligation to work for <em>you</em>, and you only.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/012017/paying-financial-advice-feeonly-vs-feebased/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

As Barry Ritholz noted in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/get-there/what-history-tells-us-about-your-investments-in-2017/2016/12/30/1e4c5714-cc4d-11e6-a87f-b917067331bb_story.html\">excellent piece</a> in the Washington Post last week, during President Grover Cleveland’s first term stocks rose 53 percent while in his second term they fell 2 percent. That wasn’t because President Cleveland forgot how to make stocks go up – it was overall market drivers that made a difference. So for medium and long-term goals – like saving for retirement or your children’s education – taking the long view with your investments is critical.</p>\n<h2>How Much Risk is Too Much?</h2>\n<p>The second point is that everyone has a different level of risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>That is why it’s critical that you have access to a sophisticated risk tolerance tool that really drills down to who <em>you</em> are, instead of only generic questions about age, income and whether or not you call yourself “aggressive” or “cautious.”</p>\n<p>If you’re risk adverse and you’re anxious about a crash or a downward trend that may affect your short term plans, you can always use January to re-balance your portfolio and lock in profits. As a wise investor once said: “no one ever lost money taking a profit.” If your risk tolerance is higher, you can view the volatility as an opportunity to maximize the possible potential for your investments. By continuing to contribute regularly to a savings or investment plan, you take advantage of the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/#sthash.URdSwiaq.dpuf\">dollar-cost averaging and compounded interest</a> to make your money work for you. If you had sold in the sharp downturn last January, for instance, instead of sticking to your plan, you would have lost out on the dramatic returns afterwards.</p>\n<p>Of course every January is a good time to meet with your advisor to rebalance your portfolio based on your own changing circumstances, tax needs, and risk tolerance. But, fundamentally, your plan is still <em>your</em> plan, no matter who wins the presidential election. Your goals are still <em>your</em> goals and compound interest <em>still</em> compounds. If you have worked with a good – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\">fiduciary, fee only &#8211; financial advisor</a> to create a workable plan based on <em>your</em> life goals and <em>your</em> circumstances, then staying the course – with minor adjustments – is very often the smartest plan. Data overwhelmingly shows that it’s “slow and steady” investing &#8211; not playing a guessing game by jumping in and out of investments &#8211; that ultimately wins the race.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Sources:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\">What is a Financial Plan?</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-importance-of-personal-finance-knowledge/\">The Importance of Personal Finance Knowledge</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-for-millennials/\">Financial Planning for Millennials: Overcoming the Fear Factor</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/112116/problem-buy-low-sell-high-advice/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

It’s a time we engage in self-reflection, ideas for self-improvement, and new – or ongoing – resolutions and goals.</p>\n<p>One of the most common resolutions is losing weight, but we all know how that goes: crowded gyms in early January, inevitable drop-off when February rolls around. In fact, a <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/\"><u>study</u></a> done by the University of Scranton shows that only about 8% of people actually achieve their resolutions.</p>\n<p>Financial resolutions often include starting – or finally sticking to &#8211; a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp\">budget</a>. Unfortunately, that resolution is all-too-often hard to stick to as well. (For related reading, see <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/newyear.asp\"><em>Financial New Year&#8217;s Resolutions You Can Keep</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Why do so many people have trouble sticking to their resolutions? One of the main reasons is having unrealistic expectations. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><u>Overconfidence</u></a> doesn’t just affect fitness goals, it affects investors’ behavior as well.</p>\n<p>How can you make this the year you stick to your goals?</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Take Baby Steps</h2>\n<p>Be reasonable in assessing where you are with your finances and don’t try to tackle everything at once. Start by listing all the areas of your financial situation you would like to improve. Then prioritize the individual elements in order of importance to you, and start by taking on one or two at a time. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/102516/achieve-your-financial-goals-financial-plan/\"><em>Achieve Your Financial Goals With a Financial Plan</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>If one of your goals is to start &#8211; and stick to &#8211; budgeting, don’t give yourself super-strict boundaries. Instead, start by creating good habits one at a time. If you want to pay off all of your <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp\">credit card debt</a>, for instance, take a look at how much debt you have and create a <u>realistic</u> weekly or monthly plan to start paying it off. If you want to buy a house in five years, you could decide to spend less now on something that you currently enjoy. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/091916/got-raise-heres-how-avoid-lifestyle-creep/\"><em>Got a Raise? Here’s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Focus on one or two goals at a time, see how it goes, and make progress – and adjustments – to stay on track.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Be Specific</h2>\n<p>Instead of saying “I am going to save more this year,” or “I am going to save $5,000 this year,” try to specify exactly how you plan to do it. Start with something like: “I will take $100 from each paycheck and put it into a savings account.” By giving yourself a tangible – achievable &#8211; steps, you’ll be better able to track how well you are sticking to it.</p>\n<p>In addition, try to think about what it is that you are trying to accomplish. Why do you want to save an extra $100 each paycheck? Are you saving up for a car? Trying to pay off debt? Building up an emergency fund? When you add purpose to your goals, it makes it more compelling and easier to accomplish. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/060816/why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\"><em>Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</em></a>)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Stay Accountable</h2>\n<p>Know yourself: accept who you are and what that means. Are you someone who might let things build up then feel too overwhelmed to jump back on track? Think about sharing your goals with a friend or family member and set times to check in with them and go over your progress. If you want to go to the gym three days a week, think about getting a workout partner. If you want to save an extra $100 from each paycheck, see if there is a friend that has the same goal and you can do it together, comparing how it’s going throughout the journey.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, understand that this is a process. Some weeks will be better than others, but, if you can follow these three steps – set realistic goals, set specific goals, be accountable &#8211; hopefully you will be part of the 8% that gets it done this year.

The basic concept of value investing is to buy investment instruments when they are “on sale.” That means buying when everyone else is selling (and prices are down) and vice versa. A bargain-hunting value investor looks for what they consider to be healthy companies that are – for whatever reason &#8211; severely undervalued. A smart value investor buys low, then patiently waits for the “herd” to catch up. Unfortunately, most investors tend to do the exact opposite. We tend to chase trends and follow the herd. (For more, see: <em><u>Don’t Let Emotions Hinder Your Investing Goals</u></em>.)</p>\n<h2>Sounds Easy. So Why is it Hard?</h2>\n<p>A huge part of smart investing is psychological and this chart illustrates of one of the many psychological roadblocks we have as investors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/the_problem_with_buy/bsherman_chart_timing.png\" /></p>\n<p>We may <em>want</em> to buy low and sell high, but that goes against <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">our instincts and biases</a>. When a stock is falling, we dump it. When a stock is rising, we buy it. We sell a company when the price is falling because we are afraid of losing more money; we buy a stock when it is rising because we have a fear of missing out. To compound the problem, most investors are not experts at realizing when something high or low “enough.”</p>\n<p>At times, investing can feel like quicksand: the more you do and the harder you try, the more you sink. It requires effort to overcome the psychological biases that often prevent us from acting in our own best interest. It is human nature, for instance, to continue to make the same mistake over and over again, or to not let go of stocks when we should through either familiarity bias or disposition effect.</p>\n<h2>Goals and Risk Tolerance</h2>\n<p>So what can you do to avoid to avoid the pitfalls of trying to buy low and sell high?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Understand your goals and risk tolerance: </strong>before you get started investing, it is critically important to understand what it is you are trying to accomplish and how much risk you are comfortable taking. Once you have that figured out, you can create an investment plan that is appropriate for you and comfortable enough to keep you from impulse buying high and panic selling low.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid market timing: </strong>instead of trying to time investments perfectly and squeeze every last cent out of each one, focus on building a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds that give you the greatest chance to succeed over the long term.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage your resources</strong>: having a great financial plan and a diversified portfolio is irrelevant if you don’t follow through and stick to it. Becoming self-aware of the pitfalls is a great first step. Having a good financial advisor is a good step too. Just make sure that they are a fee-only fiduciary, so that they have <em>your</em> best interests in mind at all times.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think about it: if it were easy &#8211; if everyone bought low and sold high &#8211; there would be <em>no</em> high or low because the market prices would be continually correcting. Bargains <em>do</em> exist and sometimes the wisest choice <em>is</em> to lock in earnings. The safest financial plan for the long run, however, is to understand your goals and risk tolerance, then work to create an investment plan that builds on gains over the long term, rather than continually outguess the market.</p>\n<p>(For more, see: <em><u>Which Investor Personality Best Describes You?</u></em>)</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/advisors/54337/brad-sherman/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

I know first hand: my mother was a public school teacher and a single mom. While some teachers may have other assets and savings they can draw on, a great number of teachers will rely on the retirement plans commonly used by teachers, known as 403(b) plans, as a source of income once they retire.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>This Is Money Teachers Will Need</h2>\n<p>In a recent series, The New York Times detailed many issues with the 403(b) plans so critical to a comfortable retirement for teachers. Their first piece, “<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-fees-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Think Your Retirement Plan Is Bad? Talk to a Teacher</a>” makes many of the same points we touched on previously in Teachers: Who is Managing Your 403(b)?</p>\n</div>\n<p>As the Times correctly points out: “Teachers in about a dozen states may not qualify for Social Security. And while public school teachers often are offered decent pensions, many of them do not work for the decades required to qualify for a full payout. And pension formulas are becoming less generous for newer recruits.”</p>\n<p>Unlike 401(k) plans that are overseen and regulated by federal law based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, many 403(b) plans fall outside of ERISA oversight and protection.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Who Can Teachers Trust?</h2>\n<p>Instead of having access to a financial advisor who is a <a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiduciary</a>, someone who exclusively &#8211; and always -must have the client’s best interests in mind, teachers are often presented with salespeople from insurance brokers who earn commissions for recommending certain products. As one teacher recounted in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-teachers-brokers-fees.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">part two</a> of the NYT series: “From the teacher’s standpoint, they really miss out getting quality advice,” said Mr. Bergeron, 27, who sold the plans for Axa Advisors’ retirement benefits group. “People who are in the schools pitching them and positioning themselves as retirement specialists are really there just to sell them one product.” (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/110816/investors-guide-new-fiduciary-rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An Investor&#8217;s Guide to the New Fiduciary Rule</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Fee-only fiduciary advisors are advisors who only recommend investments that are the best for their <em>clients</em>, not ones that reward themselves. Fiduciary financial advisors aren’t trying to hit a quota or working for sales commissions on the products they recommend to you. Fiduciaries are committed to providing the best advice to investors – like teachers &#8211; looking to build a strong foundation. These advisors grow <em>with</em> you, not at your expense by profiting off the products they recommend to you.</p>\n<p>Many of the millions of employees in this country have access to 401(k) plans through their employer that are approved and monitored by the employer in some way, ensuring at least some oversight of the plan itself. Unfortunately, public school teachers as well as some teachers working for nonprofits and religious institutions are easy prey for companies trying to sell high-cost products because their retirement plans often don’t have the same oversight. Given the loosely regulated industry, the insurance salespeople or “advisors” pitching to teachers can recommend investment products that best for their own pockets, not the plan owners’.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>The Costs and Confusion</h2>\n<p>While 401(k) plans are not perfect either, as <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">we have pointed out before</a>, the majority of them offer more traditional investment options, such as mutual funds or stocks and bonds, making it easier to understand how your money is invested. In contrast, 403(b) plans are often held inside annuities, which can be confusing even for the most intelligent individual investors. Discussing Axa Advisors, a broker that often tries to sell annuities, <em>The New York Times</em> writes: “The most popular version of the Equi-Vest annuity has a total annual cost that can range from 1.81 to 2.63%, according to an analysis from Morningstar. In contrast, large 401(k) plans usually charge an annual fee of less than half a percent of assets, according to a May report by BrightScope using 2013 data.”</p>\n<p>Even if teacher realizes that they are paying excessive costs for their retirement investments, they are often locked into these annuities and required to pay a penalty if they want to make changes. If a teacher wants to transfer their assets out of the Axa Equi-Vest annuity into their own IRA, for example, they would have to pay a 5% penalty on the portion of that withdrawal that had been contributed within the last six years.</p>\n<p>One of — if not the biggest — advantage of many retirement plans is tax deferral, which allows these accounts to grow and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">compound</a> over a long time horizon. That ability to grown and earn compound interest is obviously compromised when you are paying excessive fees year over year.</p>\n<p>Teachers are one of our most important assets and deserve to be rewarded for their years of dedication to our country’s children, and therefore our country’s future. All too frequently, however, teachers not given access to solid, low-cost and efficient long-term investment options in their retirement plans. Nor are they given access to a financial advisor they can turn to with questions, knowing that they can trust the answers they are given.</p>\n<p>We encourage teachers to spend some time finding out more about their 403(b) retirement fund managers. It’s vital to find out whether they are a fiduciary, how they make money (fee-based or fee-only), and how personalized their investment strategy is.  (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/111116/403b-plans-flaws-teachers-should-know/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

That way you’ll be comfortable sticking to your investment strategy and plan through peaks and dips.

It could be because the plan stops sending statements, or it could just be that you’re focusing on what’s going on in your life right now. There may even be a few you’ve lost track as the years pass.</p>\n<p>Consider too, that even if you have kept track of your old 401(k) accounts and know exactly what’s in each of them, you many not realize that you have other options besides just leaving the account and investments as is.

Your managers may be prioritizing the profits of their institution by investing your money in their own funds, even if that is not the best investment option for you. As <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\">John Oliver </a>recently demonstrated, these conflicts of interest can cost millions over the course of a single retirement plan’s life. Awareness is key. Make sure you look at old 401(k) statements from past employers to determine if they are being managed properly according to your needs and situation.</p>\n<h2>What Are Your Options?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<p>If you do determine that your 401(k) plan from a previous employer is not being managed properly, or as beneficially to you as it could be, the good news is that you have options. You can roll the funds into a new employer’s 401(k) plan or into an IRA account that you already hold. <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/071715/8-reasons-roll-over-your-401k-ira.asp\">Rolling over a 401(k) </a>into an IRA has potential benefits that could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower management and expense fees</li>\n<li>A wider range of investment options</li>\n<li>Consolidating multiple accounts into one retirement account</li>\n<li>The option to work with a fiduciary financial advisor with whom you are comfortable and whose recommendations are in your your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/change-your-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best interest at all times</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Can’t Find Your 401(k) Statement?</h2>\n<p>If you have lost track of an old 401(k) account, don’t worry, there are ways to search for it.

But once you’ve left a company, take a good look at your plan and decide if it makes sense for you to leave the funds there, move them into a current plan, or move them into an IRA where you, and a Fee-Only fiduciary financial planner, can take advantage of a broader range of investment choices.</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/102116/options-your-401k-when-you-change-jobs/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Whether it’s career progress, a workout plan, or an investment portfolio, it’s exciting to see fast results. And it can be frustrating when progress doesn’t come quickly: when you’re not learning those guitar chords fast enough or your portfolio isn’t shooting ahead of the Dow.</p>\n<p>Achieving real progress and real gains usually takes time in spite of tantalizing offers to get rock-solid abs in seven days, learn to flip houses in two weeks, or a discover sure-fire stock that’s the next Apple.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Wanting to See Quick Results</h2>\n<p>It’s human nature to crave quick results but when it comes to investing, your emotions &#8211; or a desire for quick gratification &#8211; can get in your way of building a solid financial plan. (For more about Behavioral Finance, see: <em><a href=\"http://investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051916/8-common-biases-impact-investment-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 Common Biases That Impact Investment Decisions</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/30/investing-is-a-fascinating-business.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> for The Motley Fool, columnist Morgan Housel made some excellent points about how we limit our chances of seeing real progress by letting our emotions get the best of us.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Frustration</h2>\n<p>“Most investing mistakes and frustrations come from trying to run a marathon in an hour,” Housel writes about the difference between short and long-term investing. “Companies earn profits, and over a long period of time those profits accrue to shareholders. If you leave it at that – and you should – investing is such a basic game that doesn’t require much action.” (For more, see <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/060816/why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy</a></em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>If we stuck to that game plan and utilized a long investment horizon to really take advantage of compound interest, the progress you would see would be impossible to ignore. Compound interest is a great way to look back and see the progress of your investments over a long time horizon. We <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summarize it like this</a>:</p>\n<p><em>Compound interest is often compared to a snowball. If a two-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny circumference. As it keeps rolling, its surface grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution. If you invest $1,000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2,158.93, in 20 years that will be $4,660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. All it takes is patience to turn $1,000 – the price of one ski weekend – into $21,724.52. </em></p>\n<p>A main problem many investors have is they fail to allow for this long time-horizon to play out. Housel&#8217;s next point builds on this when he says…</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Progress Happens Too Slowly to Notice</h2>\n<p>“Progress happens too slowly to notice; setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.” This ties into the idea of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">prospect theory</a> and Housel summarizes this concept well: “Pain hurts more than the same level of gain feels good.” This is similar to the concept of loss aversion where investors make emotional decisions that unfortunately lead to doing the exact opposite that one should do. Take 2008, for example, when the markets lost almost 40% in a short period of time. Those who made emotional decisions and exited the markets quickly not only locked in a significant loss but likely missed out on one of the biggest <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\">bull markets</a> in history as the market tripled over the next six years.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So much of this is human psychology. Having a dollar that stays a dollar doesn’t feel like you’re losing money. And losing a dollar often hurts more than gaining a dollar feels good. It’s like sports — losing a close game generally makes people feel lower than winning a close game makes you feel good. That’s what makes our job so interesting — working with people to park their psychology at the door, not just today, but forever. Not easy, but when done correctly you can really start seeing that elusive “progress” word come into play. (For more, see: <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/080116/why-playing-it-safe-could-hurt-your-retirement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Playing It Safe Could Hurt Your Retirement</a></em>.)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Avoiding Catastrophic Mistakes</h2>\n<p>“Most investing success boils down to avoiding catastrophic mistakes.” You don’t need to be the world&#8217;s greatest stock picker to benefit from investing. Far from it actually. As Housel puts it: “Few good decisions are needed to do well over time.” Instead, what we need to do is avoid making the catastrophic mistakes that typically come from making an emotional decision and not planning properly. Market corrections happen. They will happen again. Without proper planning, it is easy to fall victim to the pitfalls of prospect theory and end up making an emotional, short-term decision that can derail any progress that you have made.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To summarize, all of this boils down to a simple line of thinking. When it comes to investing, leave your emotions at the door. If you are uncomfortable with your investments, that is something you should take immediate action in. You may be invested in a portfolio that is too risky based on your goals, <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/embed/90260b609e67a973f2f0\">risk tolerance</a> and needs. You may just not fully understand how you are invested which makes you nervous. Worst of all, you may have no plan what so ever. Start by reevaluating your goals, short, mid and long term. Create a plan and road map to accomplish those goals, and then stick to it.

Here&#8217;s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep","content":"<p>We work with a lot of young professionals and because of that, we get the pleasure of seeing many of our clients progress up the ladder in their career. With this often comes more responsibility but also more money. A raise is something you should be proud of as it represents the payoff from the sacrifices you have made and the hard work you put in. This calls for a celebration, as it should!</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is crucial to make sure you don’t fall victim to the dreaded lifestyle creep, famously coined by financial planner <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/big-raises-and-lifestyle-creep-why-its-crucial-to-establish-good-spending-habits-early/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael Kitces.</a> The basic concept of lifestyle creep is that as your discretionary income goes up (you get a raise), your standard of living goes up with it. For example, before you stuck to a dining budget where you only ate out on weekends, but now you are doing so two times a week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/antoine-walker/\">We recently wrote about how a former NBA star filed for bankruptcy after earning more than $100 million on the court. </a>Read below on some tips to help you avoid some of these mistakes.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Why Lifestyle Creep Is a Problem</h2>\n<p>Living above your means is a recipe for financial trouble. We constantly preach that it’s not about how much you make, but how <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/savings/\">much you save</a>. By earning more money, you have the opportunity to save more. Take advantage of these opportunities by really thinking about what is a necessity vs. what is a luxury.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Read below on some tips to help you avoid some of these mistakes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Write down and revisit your goals</strong></li>\n<li>Maybe your goals have changed, maybe they haven&#8217;t. By revisiting them, remind yourself what is important to you and you can then make sure that is what you are spending your money on.</li>\n<li>One additional suggestion is to not make any purchases with the money you are receiving from your raise for the first month after receiving it. This gives you time to digest the news and will give you the ability to make more rational purchase decisions. If you still want to buy it after a month, then go for it.</li>\n<li><strong>Create and update your budget</strong></li>\n<li>If you don’t already have a budget, now is the perfect time to create one. If your boss gives you a $10,000 raise, that comes out to about $830 per month before taxes. With your goals in mind from tip No. 1, lay out all of your expenses and determine where the money should go each month. By having a set schedule, you reduce the urge to make impulse purchases because you see a large number in your checking account.

There are numerous banks that we recommend to our clients that give you the ability to create multiple savings accounts to bucket your savings based on your goals. Create accounts for each of your goals and set up automatic transfers to these accounts from each paycheck you receive.</li>\n<li>In addition to your emergency fund account and other savings goals, make sure to give yourself a fun account that can be used to spend on celebrations such as getting a raise!</li>\n<li><strong>Increase or max out your retirement contribution</strong></li>\n<li>As part of your budget, look at how much you are <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/playing-safe-hurt-retirement/\">contributing to your retirement account</a> each month. If you have the opportunity to increase your contribution, that is a great option to consider. If you have an employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">401(k)</a>, not only are you saving more for retirement, but you are also lowering your taxable income that just increased because of your raise. You may even qualify for an employer match, which makes these savings even greater!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After working so hard to get to where you are now, you should give yourself a chance to enjoy that success and celebrate. The important part is keeping an eye on the big picture and not letting your short-term emotions get in the way of achieving your true financial goals. By creating a plan that is realistic and one that you feel you can stick to, you dramatically increase your chances of success.

I know from personal experience, though, that teachers would be wise to use any spare time to investigate their retirement accounts and determine whether their money is being deployed as effectively as possible.</p>\n<p>My mom was a public school teacher and single mother. You can imagine how slim her finances were. Still, she managed to save up some money despite her paltry salary. After a while, however, she found out that the managers of her <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/403bplan.asp\">403(b) plan</a> were not investing her money as effectively as they should have been. A lot of her savings were tied up in a high-cost annuity that could have been invested in much cheaper options. These people, who were employed by the county to help her money grow, were actually eroding her savings.

Those words mean that a fiduciary will never do to clients what my mother’s managers did to her—we are legally obligated to act only in clients&#8217; best interests. Most schools will offer a 403(b) plan for teachers. However, as with the custodians of my mom’s savings, these plans can often be managed by a third party, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/donald-trump-takes-a-stand-on-401k-investments/\">non-fiduciary advisor </a>who may not act in clients&#8217; best interests.

FINRA recently released the results of its 2015 <a href=\"http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/downloads/NFCS_2015_Report_Natl_Findings.pdf\">survey</a>, which includes the fact that only 37% of those who took the survey could answer four of the five questions on a basic financial literacy quiz. Four out of five is FINRA’s baseline for high financial literacy. Back in 2009, 42% of the respondents were considered to meet this level of financial literacy. (If you’re curious, you can take the quiz <a href=\"http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/quiz.php\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>We’ve previously written about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/common-investor-biases/\">biases</a> in financial habits and the desolate state of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\">personal finance education</a> in high school and college, and this study re-confirms our suspicions. Way less than half of the American population has a sufficient understanding of the basic ideas necessary for successful saving and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-test-drive/\">financial planning</a>! That is nearing crisis levels.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake–an ignorance of personal finance, while probably unintentional, has serious consequences. Just over half of respondents said they are worried about running out of money in retirement, only one in five are willing to take risks when investing, and 57% say they set long-term financial goals. But, when taken together with those statistics, the most concerning part is that 76% have a high self-assessment of their financial literacy.</p>\n<p>As finance writer Jeff Sommer points out in his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/your-money/what-you-think-you-know-about-money-but-dont-can-hurt-you.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent column</a>, this means that Americans don’t know very much about personal finance and saving, but think they do. The positive self-perception is also the only figure to have significantly increased since 2009.</p>\n<p>Improving financial conditions can create a false sense of security for many savers who think their current status makes them recession-proof. This is a huge reason why I decided to start my own firm. I recognized the alarming lack of awareness about saving, spending and the markets, and noted many common bad habits that can lead to trouble in an economic downturn.

Traditional wealth management practices often have <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">high account minimums</a> that make their financial advice unreachable for most people. Moreover, even if you can open an account with a wealth manager, they may not be required by law to act in only <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/fiduciary-planner.asp\">your best interest</a>, which can lead to inefficient investments for you that pay them commissions.</p>\n<p>The reality is that many people are scared by the thought of investing. Since many Americans are mostly in the dark, they may not know where to go or how to start. That’s why it’s important to use online resources and educate yourself on all aspects of personal finance.

Full-time offers will be tendered, sighs of relief exhaled and paychecks cashed. Interns who receive offers will be bright-eyed with lofty visions of moonshot careers at their new place of employment. As these interns begin to accept the end of college and pivot towards the start of the rest of their lives, we strongly encourage them to start considering a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\">long-term financial plan.</a></p>\n<p>Sure, it is tempting to put most of your extra cash earned this summer in your checking account for drinks, trips to visit friends or to buy yourself something nice. The decidedly less glamorous option is to put a chunk of that cash into a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp\">Roth</a> or <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp\">Traditional individual retirement account</a> (IRA). But, almost certainly, that is the option for which your future self would pat you on the back. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\"><em>The Conflicts of Interest Around 401(k) Plans.</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Early Planning Is a Tough Sell</h2>\n<p>We know this is a tough sell for most college students. Salaries and long-term financial security aren&#8217;t big concerns for today’s generation as it has been before. Even on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wallstreet.asp\">Wall Street</a>, where compensation is high, interns seek other qualities in a company. For example, interns at investment bank Jefferies <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-interns-write-monthly-memo-000000295.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said they valued </a>relatable leadership, a family atmosphere and inclusion. So we get that saving for retirement may not be where your mind is at—especially if you received an offer and want to celebrate. (Which, by all means, you should.)</p>\n</div>\n<p>We aren’t here to suggest you start living a life of austerity now that college is almost over. But you must consider that right now is the best time in your life to put a bit of money away for retirement. The <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\">power of compound interest</a> means that the earlier you start saving, the greater your returns will be. It doesn’t matter how small the amount—money invested in the stock market can grow exponentially over time because it compounds year over year.</p>\n<p>In our experience, many college-aged people <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">don’t know where to start</a>, even if they are interested in opening an IRA. The choice between, for example, a Roth or Traditional IRA can be opaque and intimidating. And then, once an account has been opened, where do you actually invest the money? How can it be monitored? (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\"><em>6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>To pile on top of that, as you graduate and find a new pad, start work and are presented with options for employer-sponsored retirement plans, you might be forced to consider trade-offs. Should you work on paying off your student loans or invest that money into growing your retirement account? Or, you might ask yourself, why invest at all when I can just keep my earnings in cash?</p>\n<p>All of this “adulting” can be overwhelming, and unfortunately often leads to poor financial decisions. (For some guidance, we highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/4-things-can-learn-john-oliver-retirement-planning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Oliver’s take on saving and financial advice</a>.) But one thing you can be confident of is that starting to save now has almost no downside. If you aren’t totally sure of your ability to open an account and invest on your own, follow John Oliver’s advice and contact a low-cost, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">fiduciary financial advisor</a> who can work with you to grow your investment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that putting a chunk of your income towards retirement at such a young age isn’t sexy. But it has enormous benefit and will set you on a path of financial wellness. It’s the right thing to do.

He has made so many newsworthy remarks that it is hard to keep up. One day last week was <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-gop-trump-go-unraveling-break-glass-mode-n622116\">particularly</a> impressive as he made over 10 news-making assertions in under 24 hours. These included initially refusing to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan, doubling down on his feud with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan and predicting that the election will be rigged. (For more, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/conflicts-interest-around-401ks/\">The Conflicts of Interest Around 401(k)s.</a>)</p>\n<p>Whether you support him or not, simply finding the time in the day to make all those remarks (and more) is impressive. But there was one opinion in particular that caught our eye, via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/760475701317427200\">CBS’s Sopan Deb.</a> Trump made the below statements during an interview with FOX Business Network&#8217;s Stuart Varney:</p>\n<p><strong>Varney:</strong> For the the small investor, the average guy, right now, would you say, yes, put your 401(k) money into stocks?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong> No, I don’t like a lot of things that I see. I don’t like a lot of the signs that I’m seeing. I don’t like what’s happening with immigration policies. I don’t like the fact that we’re moving tremendous numbers of people from Syria are coming into this country and we don’t even know it. Thousands of people, thousands and thousands of people. There’s so many things that I just don’t like what I’m seeing. I don’t like what I’m seeing at all. Look, interest rates are artificially low. If interest rates ever seek a natural level, which obviously would be much higher than they are right now, you have some very scary scenarios out there. The only reason the stock market is where it is—is because you get free money.</p>\n<h3>Trump&#8217;s Approach</h3>\n<p>Even if you are his number one fan, please don’t hire Donald Trump to manage your 401(k). First of all, setting aside the economic truth of what Trump is saying and whether his fears will ultimately influence the market as much as he thinks, every factor that he mentions in his response is short-term. As Trump is 70 years old, focusing on what’s coming immediately down the line is understandable. But most investors have longer to go until retirement and therefore need to be invested in the stock market’s long-term gains, particularly those investors without Trump’s level of wealth. (For more, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/playing-safe-hurt-retirement/\">Why Playing It Safe Could Hurt Your Retirement.</a>)</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-02/donald-trump-your-401-k-adviser\">Bloomberg points out</a>, Trump’s strategy basically amounts to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\">timing the market</a>. We believe that in the long run, due to the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">efficient market hypothesis</a>, you can’t beat the returns of the market through individual stock selection and market timing. Therefore, the safest thing to do is to stick with the market, while of course monitoring constantly and rebalancing.</p>\n<p>Trump’s approach could be a recipe for long-term disaster. Fidelity Investments has compared how investors who pulled out of the market near its bottom in 2008-09 fared versus those who stayed. Those investors who stuck with the market ended 2015 $82,000 richer than those who withdrew, on average. (For related reading, see: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\">Why Investors Can Be Their Own Worst Enemy.</a>)</p>\n<p>So even if Trump is completely correct, it is not a good strategy for a long-term retirement saver, which is the demographic he was asked about. If Donald Trump applied his advice to your 401(k), you’d probably do worse than if you ignored him, even in the case of a market correction.</p>\n<p>Asked about alternatives to the stock market, Trump would likely point to real estate (<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/donald-trump-and-the-benefit-of-financial-foresight/\">we wrote about that here</a>), which is where most of his dealings have been. The answer is somewhere in between a diversified portfolio with investments in real estate (if you can afford it), but also stocks, bonds, the money market, etc. If a market correction really is coming as Trump predicts, then the best hedge against it isn’t to pull all your money out of equities. Rather, for most savers, we think the best protections are a long-term financial plan and a diversified portfolio, both of which account for short-term market volatility.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/080916/donald-trump-takes-stand-401k-investments/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
