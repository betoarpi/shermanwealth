After all, the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/02/26/raising-child-costs-233-610-you-financially-prepared-parent/357243002/\">average cost of raising a child today</a> in middle-class America is nearly $250,000, excluding college tuition expenses. These types of numbers leave many couples in “catch up” mode when it comes to their savings and retirement planning.</p>\n<p>The first step, as we all know, is creating a plan. You can’t make any headway towards debt and savings goals without a clear, executable strategy. Three big keys are: concentrate on building up your investments, boost your credit, and reevaluate your real estate needs. This is a major inflection point in your life, and thus an ideal time to consider all these topics.</p>\n<p>Regarding your savings, your cash flow is (hopefully) growing, or at least turning positive. Because you have a limited amount of time to get things in order, taking action in the areas mentioned above should be done as soon as possible, especially if any emergency funds have been drained. More parents tend to undersave and overspend while their children are still living under their roof. Here are some questions to ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do we have enough cash to make it through the next economic contraction or bear market?</li>\n<li>Is our credit card debt manageable?</li>\n<li>Are the balances in our 401(k) and IRA accounts where they need to be?</li>\n<li>Is our house “too much” for us without the children?</li>\n<li>Do they kids still need insurance?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that some of your larger expenses have come and gone, there must be a mental shift from “paying the bills” to “creating a better future”. You will need to monitor your assets more closely now, and extra money should be going more towards retirement accounts and less towards material things. There is good news for those who may be a little behind, as <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19000-for-2019-ira-limit-increases-to-6000\">the IRS has increased contribution limits in 2019</a> for 401(k) and IRA accounts.</p>\n<p>However, one key to keeping your nest empty is taking the time to educate your children on the importance of personal finance. This is a very important step in creating and maintaining a “moat” around your new-found savings. The more educated your children are on the basics of day-to-day money management, the less likely they are to need your assistance in the immediate future. These are great opportunities to preach to them about not living beyond their means, sticking to a budget, saving a little each month, and the consequences of debt.</p>\n<p>There are a few important things than can be tackled that will allow you to get off on the right foot towards rebuilding your retirement savings. The key is to capitalize on the new-found opportunities to do so. And one of those, in this moment, is a focus on your future, not your child’s future. Of course you should give them the tools to financially fend for themselves, but going forward the main goal is retirement for you and your spouse.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5384615384615385,"src":"/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/da113/empty-nest-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/3f132/empty-nest-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/8850c/empty-nest-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/da113/empty-nest-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/7223d/empty-nest-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/f2cbb/empty-nest-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/414abb631d27d75bc19c3727900a33c2/9352a/empty-nest-1.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c9e14ebb-3ba0-54aa-b18d-faa5a19a25e1","slug":"tips-for-furloughed-workers-during-the-shutdown","title":"Tips for furloughed workers during the shutdown","content":"<p>Before we get started, lets recognize that this isn’t the first time there’s been a shutdown, and it probably won’t be the last. But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that so many workers are now reaching their third week of no pay. There are roughly 800,000 federal employees who are not receiving paychecks right now, many of whom are located right here in the DC Metro area. While some are technically on a &#8220;leave of absence&#8221;, many are being expected to work for no pay. What&#8217;s worse is that federal employees already make, on average, quite a bit less than their private sector peers. On top of this, while most workers are expecting to be paid retroactively once the shutdown is over, it’s not mandatory.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, take a look at your monthly budget and find items you can easily remove.</p>\n<p>Another helpful tip is to contact your bank. In fact, one institution headquartered here in the DC Metro, Navy Federal Credit Union,  is extending a zero-interest loan up to $6,000 with no fees and a grace period. Many banks are willing to make exceptions. Bank of America and Wells Fargo also have outreach programs that assist federal employees. Most institutions have similar processes in place for their employees that allow them to contact creditors and landlords in order to ask for assistance.</p>\n<p>Another step that federal employees can take is to proactively reach out to creditors. Best move? Develop a simple letter that explains your situation: &#8220;I am a government employee who has lost income due to the government shutdown. Due to these events, my income has been drastically reduced for the time being and I am unable to make my payment in full this month.&#8221; On top this, don&#8217;t forget to include account numbers and contact information with the letter.</p>\n<p>While filing for unemployment may seem like the best &#8220;quick fix&#8221;, that isn&#8217;t necessarily true. A large portion of these federal employees can apply for unemployment while on temporary leave of absence. Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t cover everyone. For those who are expected to report to work without pay (as mentioned above), do not qualify for these benefits. In most states (and D.C.), if you collect unemployment benefits, and then receive retroactive your pay, you will indeed be require to repay the government.</p>\n<p>If you are a government worker who participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, you may take loans from their retirement savings if the furlough is expected to last 30 days or less. You may not take the loan if your leave goes beyond that period. However, remember than once you remove money from your retirement account, that money is no long invested in the market. You will also be required to repay the money, so this should be used as a last resort.</p>\n<p>One last note to keep in mind: Be skeptical about picking up work while you are on furlough. Even though the government is shut down, you are still an employee of the federal government. Because of this, certain employment (outside the scope of your federal job)may be restricted.</p>\n<p>While these tips may bring short-term relief, the best course of action is to develop a long-term plan for these types of situations. This will be the first time that a government shutdown has extended past two pay periods, making the financial situation for many households that much tighter. No one knows how long the current shutdown will last, or when the next will arise, and that is exactly the reason to be prepared for these types of scenarios.</p>\n<p>If you are federal employee who has questions about your day-to-day income during the shutdown, and are wanting to talk to a professional, please f<a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">eel free to reach out</a> to us.

Which reminded me that now is a great time to revisit your W-4. Why? Because t’s very, very likely that the W-4 form on file with your employer is off. Last year, the Treasury Department and the IRS released <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/2019-tax-brackets/\">updated withholding tables </a>(below) to reflect the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation resulted in lower individual income tax rates, a doubled standard deduction and the elimination of personal exemptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5057\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1.jpg 649w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-tax-bracket-1-1-300x111.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As we know, taxes can be somewhat finicky: if not enough is withheld, you’ll owe money come tax time. Pay too much, and you end up with a large refund. On top that, while earning a bigger paycheck twice a month sounds awesome, it could come back to hurt you come April. With all this being said, we obviously want to be as close to zero as possible. But how do we accomplish this in a changing tax environment?</p>\n<p>Prior to 2019, it was common to withhold less from your pay if you had deductions that were itemized. However, that may no longer hold true considering the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/taxes/2019/01/08/5-popular-tax-deductions-that-took-big-hits-from-t.aspx\">standard deduction is nearly twice</a> what it previously was. Due of these new tax laws, a high percentage of households who itemized in previous years will no longer be able to do so (another reason to check up your withholding). Previous laws also allowed income earners to withhold less in taxes if you they had dependents. Going forward, these types of exemptions are gone, so those filers should review their pay stub to ensure that they’re not under-withheld.</p>\n<p>Another reason to make sure your refund isn&#8217;t &#8220;too big&#8221; is because you will, more or less, be giving the government an interest-free loan. With cash accounts now paying above 2%, that money is better off working for you in your own account. This would allow you to pay off debt, add to your savings, or a multitude of things that are better than simply giving it to the US government for a year, which <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\">we have covered before</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are retired, one option is to use your Form W-4V to withhold a flat rate from your Social Security earnings. Further, use your Form W-4P to withhold from your pension. Additionally, there are <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tax-deductions-that-are-going-away-4582165\">new limits on deductions for state and local taxes and home mortgage interest</a>, a big item for many in the DC Metro and other locales.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re feeling confused about the upcoming tax season (which is almost upon us), please <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact/\">feel free to reach out</a> to us.

Investors, who are probably over the volatility from 2018, were unfortunately required to sit through a couple more brutal sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its worst start a year since 2000. However, following a reassuring tone from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, large indices will actually finish the week in positive territory.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, President Trump seemingly doubled down on his willingness to let the government shutdown continue.

Year after year we see the same types of studies and the alarming statistics they produce in regards to savings and retirement planning (or lack thereof). </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-big-reason-americans-are-so-stressed-and-unhealthy-2018-10-11?link=sfmw_tw\">Almost half of Americans</a></span><span class=\"s1\"> (44% to be exact) list money as the largest contributor to stress in their lives. To make matters worse, the stress isn’t confined to the household. A <a href=\"http://jhrps.com/Wellness\"><span class=\"s2\">recent John Hancock study</span></a> found that 72% of us take our money worries into the workplace with us, clearly affecting more of our daily lives than we would like. That same study claims that this stress causes physical and psychological problems (anxiety, sleeplessness, etc.) for nearly 60% of us. Many will say that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/why-dont-americans-save-money/478929/\"><span class=\"s2\">American’s simply cannot afford to save money</span></a> anymore. Medical expenses are high. Housing is expensive. Short-term burdens make it hard to plan for long-term goals. Many work at a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Rising number of single-parent households. The list is endless. And trust me, I get it. I totally understand these hurdles can be intimidating.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But at the end of the day, these are all just excuses. Just like they were excuses last year and the year before that. We constantly spend our time fretting over these topics, but ironically never put a plan together to actually get ahead. It’s the same scenario as the person who feels they are overweight, goes to the gym for two weeks each January, and then eventually gives up on their weight loss plan. You need a plan. And better yet, you need someone that is going to hold you accountable to that plan. Without a well-established roadmap, how are you going to reach your final destination? No one ever accomplished anything without executing a plan! And it’s not just about a retirement plan. Having a plan for weekly and monthly expenses will build the mental consistency that is required for longer term goals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don’t let 2019 be another year of day-to-day stress, secretly praying that no unexpected expenses pop up between now and your next paycheck. It’s a vicious cycle that is hard to remove yourself from unless you come up with a concrete plan of action and stick with it. Making more money is not the key to living a financially stress-free life. It can help, sure. But with out a plan you will eventually fall back into the same, undisciplined routine. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are having trouble developing a plan or are unsure where to start, <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\">please feel free to reach out to us</a>.

Coming into the month of December, we were told how, historically, this is a bullish time of year for equities. Unfortunately, “historically” is just another term for “average” and while December may typically be a strong month, that was not the case this year. It’s usually a positive month, rarely negative. But it looks like 2018 will not see a normal December, which would make sense considering how the full year has played out in general.<a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4775\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1.png 624w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-returns-12.14.18-1-300x177.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trade tariffs continue to garner the most attention in headlines. The market tends to have large, upward swings on positive news regarding the US-China debacle, but they are short-lived, as many feel these positive updates simply fall into the “boy who cried wolf” category at this point. We may not see a sustained move in either direction (up or down) until some kind of formal agreement has been reached between the two parties.</p>\n<p>To add to the worries, signs from abroad have not been much better. British Prime Minister Theresa May has fallen on tough times in regards to her Brexit battle, now fighting for her own political life. This week, a right-wing faction in her own party triggered a “no confidence” vote following May’s decision to postpone the debate over a deal that could have finally brought closure to the issue as a whole, which initially arose over two years ago. In China, weak economic data shows that the trade tensions are severely affecting their economy, with weaker than expected industrial output and retail sales numbers. On top of this, the reports out of Europe weren’t any better. In fact, the German and French private sectors (arguably the two most important in the Eurozone) are trending downwards in terms of growth. Further, Italian debt issues keep the country on the brink of recession. Despite the headline worries and weak economic showings in foreign economies, the US data continue to produce strong numbers, although some areas are starting to slow. Retail sales remain high, while manufacturing and service sectors output fell to new lows. We are still in an expansion, albeit at a slower than what we have been accustomed to over the past few years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Where is Bitcoin?</p>\n<p>Last year’s favorite asset, Bitcoin, is now down over 70% on the year, back to the $3300 area we saw last July 2017.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4776\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"845\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1.png 845w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1-300x176.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12.14.18-Bitcoin-YTD-1-768x451.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If your goals for your assets have changed, if you believe your risk tolerance may not be in line with the drawdown you’ve seen in your portfolio recently, or if you just want to talk about your individual situation this is a great opportunity to <a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">let us know</a>.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":2,"src":"/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/9f2d5/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png","srcSet":"/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/91db1/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 100w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/dc47e/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 200w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/9f2d5/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 400w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/fa42c/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 600w,\n/static/76bd6e59b91f58540bc0e1e2063b1020/5ea33/SWM-Weekly-Market-Review-Header-1-1.png 751w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"4b2a7753-fcc2-54d8-b3d3-a710fdcbd155","slug":"weekly-market-review-12-07-2018","title":"Weekly Market Review 12/07/2018","content":"<p>We experienced more of the choppy environment in equities this past week.

First off, crude oil prices have fallen from $76 to $50 per barrel recently, which should cause some relief at the pump for consumers. In fact, national gasoline <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/12/07/gas-prices-reach-new-2018-low/\">prices fell to $2.46/gallon</a>, a new low for 2018. A main cause of the lower prices has been the massive over-production here in the US. On the other hand, natural gas prices have seen a large spike over the last few weeks, in large part due to the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/natural-gas-prices-have-surged-over-the-last-month-heres-why.html\">lowest stockpiles of gas</a> in nearly a decade. So, while you may be saving money when you fill up your car for a long road trip over the holidays, you may see a higher natural gas than usual as we go further into the winter months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4769\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"843\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1.png 843w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1-300x177.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/market-review-12718-4-1-768x452.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you are feeling a little antsy over the recent market volatility, I would like to bring your attention to the chart below. The average intra-year drop on the S&amp;P 500 is roughly 14%. So far this year we have experienced two declines, one of 12.8% (January &#8211; February) and one around 11.3% (October). Both are below the average. These types of swings are experienced on an annual basis. Due to the fact that 2017 was such a low volatility year (as mentioned above), recency bias has kicked in and has many believing that the 2018 environment is seeing above-average fluctuations. It is not.

That time when mutual fund companies report distributions for capital gains taxes. Just in time for the holidays and a total buzzkill on all of that discretionary spending you planned on participating in.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“But I’m in a Buy &amp; Hold portfolio and didn’t sell. How can I have a taxable gain?” Ah, this is where one of the (many) hidden flaws of investing in mutual funds comes into the picture. It’s not about what you, the investor and shareholder, buy and sell. It’s about what happens behind the curtains of the fund you’re invested in. Probably not something your advisor has taken the time to explain to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A capital gains distribution is a payment to shareholders that is prompted by a fund manager&#8217;s liquidation of underlying stocks and securities in a mutual fund or derived from dividend and interest earned by the fund&#8217;s holdings minus the fund&#8217;s operating expenses. Further, </span><span class=\"s2\">these distributions must be made</span><span class=\"s1\"> because tax law dictates that substantial portion of investment income and capital gains must be paid to investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“But my return on the fund is essentially flat (or negative) for the year. Why is the distribution so high?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Again, this is one of the most frustrating things about mutual funds and why they are, for the most part, terribly inefficient from a tax perspective. Regardless of how long the investor owned the fund, the distributions are taxed based on how long the fund itself held the sold holdings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Can you imagine owning a fund that returned 1-2% in 2018 and being told you are going to get hit with a 10% (or even larger in some circumstances) taxable event? It’s not even your choice. Was your “buy and hold” game plan specifically built to be tax-conscious? Well, maybe in theory it was. But reality is different. Even many Vanguard mutual funds are paying massive distributions in 2018. This is a big deal for investors with assets in accounts that aren’t a 401(k) or IRA.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In an <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/890938/more-tax-pain-for-some-mutual-fund-shareholders-in.html\">excellent piece</a> by Christine Benz earlier this month, she points to the fact that “many mutual funds are likely to dish out capital gains distributions that are on par with&#8211;or even higher than&#8211;years past adds insult to injury.” Mutual funds that need to raise cash can sell profitable investments and create capital gains for investors, even if the fund has performed poorly. This means you can lose money on an investment in a mutual fund but still end up owing taxes. As I mentioned above, capital gains in a mutual fund get passed along to its investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> An <a href=\"https://www.etftrends.com/etf-strategist-channel/etfs-tax-time/\"><span class=\"s2\">interesting article</span></a> put out by ETF Trends states that ETFs have tax efficiency built into the structure. The “exchange traded” attribute of the ETF structure allows investors to purchase and sell shares without creating or redeeming small odd-lots. This is very different from mutual funds where every day mismatched buyers and sellers force transactions and tax implication in the underlying fund. The tax implications from these transactions become liabilities to those still holding the mutual fund shares. Furthermore, the creation and redemption process, which allows for in-kind transaction with Authorized Participants (APs) can further reduce the likelihood of creating a distributable capital gain in the ETF structure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With all this said, I again point to the fact that ETFs, particularly from a taxable income standpoint, are much more optimal for investors over the long term. There are plenty of other arguments (closet indexing, high(er) fees, diversification, etc.) of why we continue to promote the use of ETFs over mutual funds, but tax consequences are by far one of the top reasons we advise clients to steer clear. Forget Sharpe Ratios and standard deviation statistics, if you want to talk about risk…it’s simply not worth the risk of getting hit by a major taxable event. Remove those possibilities from your game plan and look to ETFs as the proper vehicle to reach the goals you’ve set for your portfolio.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you would like to have your portfolio analyzed for fees and tax efficiency schedule a time to chat with us <a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">here </a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9230769230769231,"src":"/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/da113/taxhazard-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/3f132/taxhazard-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/8850c/taxhazard-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/da113/taxhazard-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/218cb46f0d338320ee7209ff89b9e78e/082bd/taxhazard-1.jpg 560w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"941fd830-b048-5e68-b2cb-f75e2756f013","slug":"the-2019-contribution-limits-are-here","title":"The 2019 Contribution Limits Are Here!","content":"<p>Great news for savers!

Talking about and managing finances together","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money woes are the leading cause of divorce in American couples. Over ⅓ of people in the United States have stated that financial pressure was the biggest challenge their marriage has faced in the past, and ¼ of Americans have said most of their arguments are money-related. As a financial planner, I work with a lot of couples &#8211; and I’m always surprised by how few of them have actually had an honest conversation about their money. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old saying holds true when it comes to household finances &#8211; communication is key. When you work toward creating a financial plan with your spouse, you need to talk to each other about expectations, frustrations, and any goals or dreams you may have. That being said, money conversations can also be incredibly uncomfortable &#8211; which is probably why so many American couples avoid them altogether. Knowing what you’re walking into, and how to best talk about money with your spouse ahead of time, can help you have a productive conversation. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know Yourself and Know Your Spouse</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to point fingers when it comes to money because it’s frustrating to admit our own faults. We may be harboring some guilt around unhealthy spending habits, or be embarrassed because we don’t know as much as we think we should about saving for retirement. On the other hand, our money mindset may be a direct result of how we were raised &#8211; and it may be different from how our spouse approaches their finances. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding where you fall down when it comes to your personal finances is key in order to talk to your spouse about building a financial plan that’s going to work for your family. When you know your own flaws, you’re able to create a plan of action that helps you to stay on track &#8211; which is something your spouse will appreciate. It’s also important to understand your spouse’s money mindset, as well as their financial strengths and weaknesses. Having a clear understanding of how each of you approach financial decisions, or value your money will help you to align your vision for the future (and avoid arguments down the road).</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approach Financial Opinions With No Judgement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal finance is always emotionally charged. Everyone has opinions on how money should be handled, and often they differ dramatically &#8211; even between an otherwise compatible couple. Money conversations between two spouses who have different opinions </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">money can evolve into arguments quickly. The key is to approach all financial opinions your spouse may hold without judgement. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, this sounds easy &#8211; it’s not. For example, if you firmly believe in paying down debt and living a debt free lifestyle, but your spouse sees the benefit in carrying some debt and would prefer to prioritize saving before debt repayment &#8211; you may find yourself falling into the trap of judging them for their opinion because you strongly believe that yours is “right.” The truth is, when it comes to money, there are no “right” opinions. Opinions are just that &#8211; opinions. They’re based on a value set and history that someone has with their personal finances. They aren’t fact, and they aren’t “wrong.” Knowing that your spouse’s financial opinions aren’t right or wrong (and neither are yours) can help you move through conversations without assigning emotional value to their ideas.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also important to avoid judgement of each other’s financial past. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/27/1-in-8-divorces-are-caused-by-student-loans.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 in 8 divorces</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are directly caused by student loan debt. The pressure that hefty debt, a lack of savings, or other financial missteps you bring to the table can potentially alienate your spouse. Working together to be on the same “team” when it comes to addressing these money woes is key.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set Goals Together</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you’re discussing your family’s finances, you’re going to come to a point where you need to set goals that you’re working toward. It’s tempting to set individual goals and work independently toward them, but that’s a recipe for financial dissonance in your household. Talking through your money goals, and working to align them with the values you share as a couple, can help you lay a foundation of financial peace in your home. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you set financial goals together as a married couple, you’re actively working to approach your money situation as a team. You’re building a safety net that protects both of you, planning for the lifestyle you want as a unit, and staying honest with one another. Once you’ve set goals as a team, you can move forward with creating a game plan that puts you on the path to reach those goals. This might mean creating a household budget, setting up automatic payments to knock out your debt or build up your savings, or building in “rewards” like a date night once you hit smaller milestones on your way to your long-term goals. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re struggling to find common ground when it comes to your  money, </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talking to a fiduciary, fee-only financial advisor can help</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

And of the people who are using their HSA, only a few of them are contributing the maximum amount each year. This gap is largely because not everyone knows about HSAs or their many benefits. As is usually the case with personal finance, the more you know, the better decisions you’re able to make. So let’s take a minute to break down what, exactly, an HSA is and how you can use it to your benefit.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is an An HSA?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An HSA, or Health Savings Account, is attached to High Deductible Health Plan insurance coverage (HDHP). In order to open an HSA, you have to be enrolled in HDHP insurance. The HSA is intended to offset the high medical costs often associated with HDHP insurance coverage &#8211; which has a high deductible (hence the name), and puts group members in a position where they have to pay out of pocket for most non-essential care services until their deductible is met. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your HSA is funded with pre-tax money, and it grows tax free.. More importantly, it rolls over from year to year, so you’re continually growing your funds without feeling pressured to use them immediately. Keep in mind that your HSA funds can only be used for qualifying medical expenses. This can include everything from doctor copays to hospital bills to a box of bandaids from your local grocery store. Putting money aside into an HSA helps to lower your taxable income while still preparing for a medical emergency, or even just offsetting smaller medical expenses &#8211; like taking your kids to the doctor. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know What You Can Contribute</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because contributions to your HSA lower your taxable income, it’s a good idea to contribute as much as you can. The current contribution limits are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$3450 if you’re single</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$6900 for a family</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add an extra $1000 to either of those figures if you’re over 55 years old</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people use their HSA to save for larger medical procedures &#8211; like having a baby, or intensive surgery. Others use it to put money aside for rising medical costs during retirement. Knowing what you can contribute is the first step to understanding what the best way to use your HSA might be. Some employers even offer a program where they assist in contributing to your HSA &#8211; which increases the total amount you’re able to save for future medical costs. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HSAs and HDHP insurance plans were originally created in hopes that if an insured individual was forced to spend their own funds on health related costs, they’d spend wisely. While this logic might work for some, others have figured out how to work the system to their advantage and use their HSA for several different financial planning purposes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To save for upcoming medical costs like cold medicine, doctor visit copays, or medical procedures</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To save for future medical costs during retirement</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To lower their taxable income</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an investment vehicle</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember: You Own Your HSA</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you create a plan for your HSA funds, it’s important to remember that you own them, not your employer. Even if you set up the account through your employer originally, you get to take that account with you wherever you choose to work in the future (or into your retirement). That’s why researching your HSA provider to ensure you’re getting the benefits </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> want is critical. It’s also important to remember that you won your HSA &#8211; and get to decide what happens to the funds in the account. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means you can decide whether you want your HSA funds to remain all-cash, or if you want to invest all or a portion of them. Additionally, you get to decide who the beneficiary is on your account, and if you want to proceed with a one-time roll over or transfer of funds from your IRA to your HSA. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think Smart &#8211; Protect Yourself</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like to view an HSA as an added layer of protection for clients. Putting money aside in an HSA has clear tax benefits, and it’s handy to have when you hit retirement. More than that, though, clients who contribute to an HSA because they’re enrolled in a high-deductible insurance plan are protecting themselves against the unknown. As a financial planner, I talk a lot about building an emergency savings and thinking about your future. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially true for </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/entrepreneurs-separate-biz-and-personal-finances/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entrepreneurs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or young families who are working to pay down debt, grow their retirement savings, and reach other financial goals &#8211; like purchasing a home. Your HSA is an added layer of insulation against the inevitable. Eventually, something will go wrong with your health (or a family member’s health).  In our case it has helped with medical bills for the kids and recently my cardiologist appointments (dont worry everything is fine). </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not uncommon for people to go into massive amounts of debt trying to pay off thousands of dollars of hospital bills after a car accident, or when their kid breaks their arm, or because they’ve been hit particularly hard by flu season. Don’t let the unexpected force you to sideline your big-picture financial goals. Regularly contributing to an HSA, or finding another way to set money aside for medical expenses, can help keep you on track.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7092198581560284,"src":"/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/9f2d5/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png","srcSet":"/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/91db1/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 100w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/dc47e/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 200w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/9f2d5/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 400w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/fa42c/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 600w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/90823/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 800w,\n/static/8305104fb05d2d3b4c5190342573fab4/d0237/Blue-and-Red-Health-Icons-Medical-Conference-Poster-1-1.png 1588w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"5d0c5742-2c45-5295-9c02-4f096b352e83","slug":"good-judge-ment-means-good-planning","title":"Good Judge-ment Means Good Planning","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Were you surprised to learn that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court justice nominee with an annual income of $247,000, could have racked up debt and saved so little for retirement?  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/brett-kavanaugh-explanation-for-crippling-credit-card-debt-is-pure-maga\">A recent article in Vanity Fair</a> reports that the Washington native accrued between $60,000 and $200,000 on three credit cards and a loan for Washington Nationals tickets as well as home improvement loans. While it’s not hard to imagine going into debt living in the DC metropolitan area, it is surprising to think that we may be investing our money more wisely than someone appointed to the highest judicial bench in the land.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brett Kavanaugh’s story unfortunately is not unique. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/heres-how-many-americans-have-nothing-at-all-in-savings.html\">According to a CNBC</a> article 35% of all adults in the U.S. have only several hundred dollars in their savings accounts and 34% of Americans have NO savings at all.  Even 40% of Baby Boomers are not ready for retirement. This shouldn’t be shocking when you look at the savings accounts (or lack thereof) for the vast majority of Americans. According to the EPI, nearly half of families have no retirement account savings at all, including IRAs and 401(k)s. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The median retirement account for U.S. families is just $5,000. Even older workers who can see retirement on the horizon aren&#8217;t prepared for it. The median savings for families whose wage earners are between 50 and 55 is only $8,000. For those who are between 56 and 61, it&#8217;s $17,000.  That’s not anywhere near enough money to get you through your golden years. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The good news is that this crisis can easily be rectified with self-discipline.  If you can commit to saving only 6% of your salary, or 3% with a match by your employer, you will be able to see the money add up over time. Using a $76,000 annual salary as a basis for our calculations, if you begin saving 6% of this at age 25 (about $760 a month), you will amass nearly $600,000 when you are ready to retire. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It isn’t too late for our potential Supreme Court justice to begin either. With a simple savings plan and some smart budgeting, Judge Kavanaugh will be able to contribute more towards his retirement account, while still managing to keep his kids at <a href=\"https://www.bsstoday.org/\">Blessed Sacrament School</a> and cheering on his beloved Washington Nationals (a passion those who know me know I share.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">  </span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Sherman Wealth | What We Can Learn From Brett Kavanaugh\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kE8rkQuOck?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/da113/IMG_7816-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/3f132/IMG_7816-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/8850c/IMG_7816-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/da113/IMG_7816-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/7223d/IMG_7816-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/f2cbb/IMG_7816-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/51087f515bcbb3f4af8e843baae0ff6c/d2f4e/IMG_7816-1.jpg 2048w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"298f32ea-fdad-5b80-907f-5c8a9df4146b","slug":"financial-literacy-beers-with-brad","title":"Introducing Beers with Brad","content":"<p>We have hosted two very successful <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/beers-with-brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Beers with Brad</strong></a> financial literacy seminars in Gaithersburg, Maryland at Launch Workplaces.  We’ve had terrific beer from great local breweries around Maryland.

Behavior is inborn, varies by person, is hard to measure, changes over time, and people are prone to deny its existence, especially when describing themselves. &#8211;<em><a href=\"http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morgan Housel</a></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Young families have so much going on in their lives that they don’t have the time to discuss personal finances and one of the greatest stresses in a marriage is finance.  We created this video to show exactly what <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/beers-with-brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Beers with Brad</strong> </a>is, how relaxed it is and how engaging the conversations are.</p>\n<h3>Plus, who doesn’t like a good local craft beer?</h3>\n<p><iframe title=\"Join Us for Beers With Brad\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/msM_rkQYkpc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about the event contact us at info@shermanwealth.com we hope to see you there!</p>\n<p>If you are unable to join this month, please let us know if you want to be added to the email list for the future events below:</p>\n<p>[contact-form-7 id=&#8221;4411&#8243; title=&#8221;Beers With Brad Updates&#8221;]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/eb188fe70f819ee6a3c33d9e5dc1709b/da113/bwb-web-1024x576-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/eb188fe70f819ee6a3c33d9e5dc1709b/3f132/bwb-web-1024x576-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/eb188fe70f819ee6a3c33d9e5dc1709b/8850c/bwb-web-1024x576-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/eb188fe70f819ee6a3c33d9e5dc1709b/da113/bwb-web-1024x576-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/eb188fe70f819ee6a3c33d9e5dc1709b/7223d/bwb-web-1024x576-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/eb188fe70f819ee6a3c33d9e5dc1709b/f2cbb/bwb-web-1024x576-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/eb188fe70f819ee6a3c33d9e5dc1709b/a2a79/bwb-web-1024x576-1.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"cb5418ce-2746-58af-9164-2cd4a7efe849","slug":"how-much-money-do-you-actually-need-in-america","title":"How Much Money Do You Actually Need in America?","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my line of business, we talk a lot about wealth management. The idea, of course, is that financial planners and wealth managers assist you in creating a road map for your money that helps you grow savings for lifestyle goals like retirement, purchasing a home, or sending your kids to the college of their dreams. The term “wealth management” often begs the question: What does “being wealthy” mean? And when do you need a financial planner to help you manage your wealth?</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Do People View Wealth?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-05-15/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-be-wealthy-in-america?__twitter_impression=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has shown that the definition of being wealthy rises as people age. Bloomberg states that Boomers tend to view $2.4 million as a requirement to be “wealthy” whereas millennial&#8217;s view wealth as a $2 million requirement. That’s a fairly large discrepancy &#8211; and it’s pretty clear what’s causing it. The younger we are, the more likely we are to view our financial future with a sense of optimism. We also tend to be more short-sighted in our financial planning, and believe that a smaller amount of wealth will last longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we age, we become more realistic about our finances. We start to see the big picture, and that honest truth is that we often need a lot more money than we realize. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Does Wealth Mean to You?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the discrepancy in what quantifies “wealth” among generations, one thing stays the same: people view wealth as several consistent things. They believe that wealth is:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freedom</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to stop worrying</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A secure future</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caring for yourself and your loved ones</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people also say that being wealthy equates to taking time for themselves in their daily life. According to the same survey, the majority of millennial&#8217;s believe that they will be wealthy in the future. However, the same optimism doesn’t translate to Boomers and other generations. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Importance of Saving</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to building wealth is saving a lot, and saving early. The sooner you can start to prioritize saving in your budget, the sooner you can begin to take advantage of compound interest. I’ve discussed this in <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/compound-interest-can-help-build-wealth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous blog posts</a>, but to review:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compound interest is essentially a snowball effect. As a snowball rolls down a hill, it grows in size. Even if you start with a small amount of money invested, it picks up more and more snow with each revolution. By the time you reach the bottom of the hill, the snowball has grown significantly, and will continue to grow faster the more you have invested. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This demonstrates the importance of saving early on in your financial life. Although many millennial&#8217;s feel positively about their opportunity for wealth, they won’t be able to capitalize on these goals if they don’t prepare now. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Importance of a Financial Plan</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This wealth study by Bloomberg also indicated that most people, unsurprisingly, felt more secure in their finances when they worked with a financial advisor on constructing their financial plan. Many millennials have yet to employ their own financial advisor, and it’s time to rethink that trend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth, many of my clients are millennial&#8217;s. I enjoy working with families and young professionals to both clearly define their goals and help them build a plan that moves them in the right direction. When advisers have the opportunity to work with millennial&#8217;s to grow their wealth, they have a leg up on pre-retirees who focus on financial planning as they near retirement: time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you implement a financial plan early in life, you have time on your side. With time, your wealth can grow significantly, and working with a financial adviser can help you make the right money moves early on to set yourself up for success in the long run.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are You Ready?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my recent video reviewing </span><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/money-milestones-this-is-how-your-finances-should-look-in-your-30s-2017-05-18\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MarketWatch’s article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on what you need saved for retirement by the time you’re 35 years old, I stressed the importance of saving early. It’s critical to start growing your wealth, even as a millennial who has many years until retirement, through targeted savings and a smart investing strategy. The critical thing to remember is you’re not just saving for retirement &#8211; you’re saving for all future goals like buying a house, sending your kids to college, or living well throughout your life. Saving is truly the only way to ensure wealth in your future, which means that saving is the only way to ensure options, freedom, and a lack of worrying about money as you age.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’d like to discuss your saving strategy, </span><a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">schedule a consultation today</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The article states that “Short-term-oriented capital markets have discouraged companies with a longer term view from going public at all, depriving the economy of innovation and opportunity. Fewer public companies has also meant fewer opportunities for retail investors to create wealth through their 401ks and individual retirement accounts.”</p>\n<p>What does your endgame look like?  Can you envision kids’ college tuition paid for, a beach house, summers off or traveling the globe?  It is never too late to change your mindset and your daily habits to achieve your dreams.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAgGBgcGBQgHBwcJCQgKDBQNDAsLDBkSEw8UHRofHh0aHBwgJC4nICIsIxwcKDcpLDAxNDQ0Hyc5PTgyPC4zNDL/2wBDAQkJCQwLDBgNDRgyIRwhMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjL/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAQX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB564MJ3k5Cf/EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQABRIh/9oACAEBAAEFAo9gXEmyL4tyVlbyzXHUhULn/8QAGBEBAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACETH/2gAIAQMBAT8BMBhNcv/EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAiH/2gAIAQIBAT8BmzH/xAAcEAACAwADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQACAyExUWH/2gAIAQEABj8CzoaVVfk4wzB9UCKl15MgeinOJ//EABsQAQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESFRMWGx/9oACAEBAAE/IaYh4NNkMoKGErlAKqaZckTtR2zEKFGfZ//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQTO//xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABGh/9oACAEDAQE/ECxSEN6v/8QAGBEBAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITH/2gAIAQIBAT8QYyzty//EAB4QAQEAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQVFhgcHw/9oACAEBAAE/EG0ZZWAa93XfIZx3iIqLsnbw7mtZACxriH5+cV8urDmpcj8KGo9zLTMqC+R9Z//Z","aspectRatio":1.8867924528301887,"src":"/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/da113/caps-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/3f132/caps-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/8850c/caps-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/da113/caps-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/7223d/caps-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/f2cbb/caps-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/e71a3f5edbec5b85e4cb8a1fc40c306e/a7c38/caps-1.jpg 2016w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"49ecaf36-8024-5ed1-b747-33faa7f72b87","slug":"patient-investors","title":"Patient Investors Come Out on Top","content":"<p>Many feel they don’t have the money they need to invest, so they forego savings altogether. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>If this is you, the time has come for you to stop shooting yourself in the foot, and start saving today. Consistency while saving is key, and can make all the difference over time. Each dollar that you contribute to your portfolio adds up. In the long run, your investments early on can make a real impact, and when the time comes to withdraw your hard earned savings, the interest you’ve earned on your investments will help to provide a comfortable retirement or any long term goal you might be saving towards.</p>\n<p><strong>Start Saving Now</strong></p>\n<p>Consider the difference of waiting to begin saving. At age 27 you will need to put away $214 a month to reach a goal of $1 million. When you start at age 37, you will need to put away $541 a month to reach your goal. If you wait until age 47, that number rises to $1,491 a month and if you wait until age 57, you’ll need to put away a hefty $5,168 a month. Waiting until the last minute (age 62) would mean having to stash $13,258 a month to reach $1 million by the age 67 &#8211; ouch!</p>\n<p>When you factor in things like compound interest, the negative impact of delaying your retirement savings becomes increasingly obvious. <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compound interest is often compared to a snowball.</a> If a 2-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny surface.</p>\n<p>As it keeps rolling, the snowball grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution. If you invest $1,000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2,158.93, in 20 years that will be $4,660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. It takes patience, but with time you can turn $1,000 into $21,724.52. That sounds like a lot of money, but if we’re being realistic, $1,000 is often spent on:</p>\n<p>• A weekend skiing with friends<br />\n• A few months of dining out with friends or your spouse<br />\n• A new piece of furniture, or tech that you may/may not need</p>\n<p>By hitting “pause” on these non-essential goals, you can easily start saving today and take advantage of compound interest.</p>\n<p>No matter where you are right now, the crucial point is to begin putting money aside immediately to achieve your long-term financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your future goals?</strong></p>\n<p>Travel? Education for your kids? Paying off your mortgage?</p>\n<p>Even when you contribute a minimal amount annually, if you’re consistent with that contribution over many years, the growth your investment will make can maximize your wealth in the long ron.</p>\n<p>The idea that you don’t have enough money right now to make your investment worthwhile is hurting you and your future. Resist the urge to overthink how much you are investing, and just act by giving what you can to your future savings today.

A far better investment plan is to focus on the big picture, and less on a perfect portfolio &#8211; where every decision is made at the exact right time.</p>\n<p>Timing the market is less important than time in the market, and getting caught up in getting that “perfect timing” is almost certain to cost you money. Aiming toward a good, solid return on your investment is a smarter strategy than worrying about every detail affecting your portfolio. All too often, people panic as soon as things start to go south (pulling out when the market has already hit bottom and putting in more when at the top). As a result, they often don’t experience this stated return in full. By resisting this urge to make a rash decision, investors showing behavioral restraint may actually wind up saving 1-2 percentage points a year.</p>\n<p>Starting early is a critical component to a successful portfolio. It is never too late (or too early) to start, so the sooner the better. Beginning in 2011, studies were conducted where participants were shown a computer generated rendering of what they might look like at their age of retirement. They were then asked to make financial decisions about whether to spend their money today or save that money for the future.</p>\n<p>In each study, those individuals who were shown pictures of their future selves allocated more than twice as much money towards their retirement accounts than those who did not see the age-progressed images. Seeing the images gave the participants a connection with their future selves that they did not possess before. As a result, their saving behavior changed dramatically because, “saving is like a choice between spending money today or giving it to a stranger years from now.”</p>\n<p><strong>Picture Your Retirement</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of viewing your future self as a stranger, think of how you actually might look. Then think of the financial decisions you are making today and how they will affect you in the future.</p>\n<p>Are your spending and saving habits today matching up with how well that future self is able to live tomorrow? Every delay you make toward saving for retirement, or investing wisely means a further burden you will place on yourself later on. In fact, starting your retirement saving early is actually more important than earning higher returns at a later date.</p>\n<p>The importance of starting now can’t be stressed enough. Luckily, fee-only, fiduciary advisors exist to help everyday people in making wise choices and to lessen the anxiety associated with what can seem like an overwhelming task.</p>\n<p>The good news is you don’t even have to be a millionaire to get this customized service. Working with a professional will enable you to maximize your return on investment and tailor a savings plan just for you. Don’t delay getting started. The benefits of starting early and often far outweigh how much you actually save.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/da113/patient-investors-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/3f132/patient-investors-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/8850c/patient-investors-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/da113/patient-investors-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/7223d/patient-investors-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/f2cbb/patient-investors-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/41077185e847cfeaff75cf20aa63fc90/a9c4a/patient-investors-1.jpg 864w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"e337a4e5-d7e2-5a1b-b65e-4a9dfc2d50fb","slug":"entrepreneurs-separate-biz-and-personal-finances","title":"Entrepreneurs: Separate Biz and Personal Finances","content":"<h5>This article appeared on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com\"><em>Investopedia.com</em></a> on May 17, 2018</h5>\n<p>As an entrepreneur, you would likely do anything to ensure your business is successful. For some, this means pouring a large portion of their money into their business. However, investing all of your time and money into your business can create an unhealthy financial balance in your life because in this situation, the success of your business will fully decide the success and growth of your personal wealth.</p>\n<p>Separating your business finances from your personal finances is hard and sometimes it’s impossible to keep the two fully isolated. The key is finding a way to grow your wealth independently of your business’s success, to reduce the risk you’re taking on. (For more, see: <em><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011816/financial-literacy-tools-small-business-owners.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Literacy Tools for Small Business Owners</a></em>.)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Build Your Personal Savings</h2>\n<p>Go into every business venture with your eyes open. Even if you have an airtight plan for profit, there’s a chance your business will experience some rough patches. To prevent this from negatively impacting your personal finances, start building your savings as soon as you can. If you haven’t started your business yet, you have some time to grow a cash savings that’s accessible to keep your personal finances in check in case of a emergency. Giving yourself several months worth of expenses is non-negotiable, and having a year or more is ideal.</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you’ve already launched your business, don’t panic. You can still prioritize saving in your current budget. To get started, set an attainable savings goal and design your budget to help reach it. Cut back on personal expenses to free up some cash flow to reach those goals.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Keep Business and Personal Expenses Low</h2>\n<p>If you’re just getting started, you’re probably already working to keep your business expenses as low as possible. This becomes harder to do as you start hitting your stride. As the money rolls in, you probably see an increase in a few things: your personal share of the profits, the amount of personal spending you do, the amount of business expenses you’re willing to take on, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<p>If your business is continuously successful, this might not seem like an issue. You’ve worked for the money, found success, and reinvested a large portion of that back into your business. However, if you keep increasing business expenses, you’ll have less wiggle room to protect your personal finances if things go south. (For more, see: <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/03/100803.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>401(k) Plans for the Small Business Owner</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>As you grow, your expenses will inevitably increase. Instead of trying to fight that, refocus to try and carefully evaluate every expense you take on. Shop around for less expensive options, or ask other business owners whether they have a similar expense, and how they’re handling it. You might find a creative solution that you hadn’t thought of before.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Avoid Distractions</h2>\n<p>We live in a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gig-economy.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gig economy</a> where “side hustles” are the latest and greatest financial pursuit. There’s nothing wrong with having a side hustle, but as an entrepreneur it doesn’t always make sense. Your business should be your number one priority. Rather than picking a lucrative side hustle that will take time away from your business, refocus that energy into finding other streams of revenue for your number one priority.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Find new ways to add value to the customers you already serve, get involved in a collaborative project with another professional that will direct business your way, and think outside of the box when growing your revenue, rather than finding a less-focused method of growing your income.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Get Smart About Investing</h2>\n<p>It’s tempting to have your business be your sole investment. Don’t fall into that trap. By having a diverse investment portfolio, you’re helping to ensure that your wealth is growing independent of your business. If you continually invest exclusively in your business, you’re increasing the amount of risk you take on.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a worst-case-scenario situation, your business goes under and you lose all of your money. To avoid that outcome, invest wisely, and in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversifiedfund.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diversified funds</a>.</p>\n<p>You may look at other professionals like doctors or lawyers who own their own practices and think, “Wow, they’re well educated, smart and successful.” We see them and assume they have it all together, and that their finances are in a better spot than ours. The truth is, they’re business owners just like you. Their businesses are equally at risk. There are no financial literacy courses at medical school.</p>\n<p>The good news is that you have the ability to take charge of your business and personal finances starting now. You can work to build savings, lower expenses and reduce the amount of risk you take on. If you make living a financially smart life a priority, you can make it happen.

Where does this disconnect come from?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few states offer personal finance or economics courses and even fewer states test students on the financial knowledge they have acquired.

How is it affecting the economy?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are graduating with loans they can’t afford to pay back and with minimal financial knowledge in planning for their futures. According to <a href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/\">Student Loan Hero</a>, Americans have over $1.48 trillion in student loan debt, which is more </span><a href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">than double</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the total U.S. credit card debt of $620 billion.

A lack of sound financial knowledge will affect the economy as these millennials enter the labor force burdened with student loans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As parents, we play a vital role in educating our children about the importance of personal finances.  In the Sherman household, we are teaching our children the importance of finances on a daily basis. Our 4 year old son is learning about savings by doing chores in return for an allowance, which he saves in his piggy bank. He is learning to save and spend his money wisely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents can begin educating their children at home in order to increase the financial literacy of their kids. By demonstrating wise financial habits, parents can serve as role models for their kids. Talking in an age appropriate way to your children about the dangers of debt and the importance of saving a portion of any money they earn instills financial values and lessons your child can use throughout life.  You may find that using an allowance is a way that you can teach your kids about saving and spending appropriately. Since it has been shown that kids who manage their own money have been found to demonstrate better financial habits in the future, giving your kids the opportunity to spend and save their own allowance or money earned is a good way to prepare them for later on. Even a simple trip to the store can be used as an opportunity to start the conversation about the danger of credit cards and how they should only be used in an emergency.  Educating your kids at an early age will enable them to better learn and practice sound financial habits while under your watchful eye and cause them to be less likely to make irrational decisions once they are out on their own. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4265 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-300x225.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-768x576.png 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1.png 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This issue is not only affecting students and young adults.  Many professionals with advanced degrees have spent countless hours studying and researching information in their particular field.  Despite all of the hours spent earning their degrees, many of these people have never taken a single course in financial education and are surprisingly not prepared to deal with the important financial decisions affecting their futures.  As a result, many extremely smart and successful people are making critical financial errors which can negatively impact the amount of money they have saved upon retirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in 2011, studies were conducted where participants were shown a computer generated rendering of what they might look like at their age of retirement.  They were then asked to make financial decisions about whether to spend their money today or save that money for the future.

As a result, their spending/saving behavior changed dramatically because “saving is like a choice between spending money today or giving it to a stranger years from now.”</span></p>\n<p>The benefits of educating your children about the importance of personal finances are undeniable, and you&#8217;ll be able to set them up for a promising future and help them prepare for retirement. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com\">Visit us online</a> for more information about how we can help improve your financial life.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.6666666666666667,"src":"/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/da113/piggy-bank-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/3f132/piggy-bank-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/8850c/piggy-bank-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/da113/piggy-bank-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/a09ef/piggy-bank-1.jpg 550w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"28ef3241-db01-5518-800a-6adef2200738","slug":"best-interest-rates-cash","title":"Money in Cash?

Put simply, people like having “money in the bank.”</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no reason for that &#8220;money in the bank&#8221; to be earning zero though, particularly when there are many FDIC-insured, highly-rated, savings account options that may be yielding a higher interest rate on your savings than your current bank or investment firm&#8217;s savings options.</p>\n<p>Short terms saving rates generally follow moves by the Federal Reserve and, as indicated by the chart to the right, short term interest rates, as reflected in short term Treasury yields, are rising. But is your bank raising your interest rates too or are they pocketing the difference and profiting? While the percentages seem small, there is actually a significant difference between earning .05% and 1.5%: the difference between earning $5 and $150 on a $10,000 savings account.</p>\n<p>Put simply, if your cash is in a zero percent interest account, it&#8217;s no better than putting it under your mattress. You’re losing money, both in lost interest and because inflation can reduce the value of your savings.</p>\n<p>Do you know if  your own savings account’s interest is keeping pace with rising interest rates? If not, check with your advisor to make sure you are maximizing your money’s earning power. If you&#8217;re not, consider shopping for a higher rate. Cash should be an asset class, but it shouldn’t earn zero.</p>\n<p>If you’re not sure, we’re always available for a free consultation to see if you’re getting the best rates and you’re maximizing the earning power of your cash reserves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4705882352941178,"src":"/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/da113/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/3f132/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/8850c/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/da113/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/7223d/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/f2cbb/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/167454f394d66e58979a0dbb52944355/356ef/money-2724241_1280-1.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"b8d2fb43-111e-5726-8608-a8a14b755aa0","slug":"fiduciary-financialplanning","title":"Paying Hidden Costs Because your Broker&#8217;s not a Fiduciary?","content":"<div>\n<div>\n<p>Investors often choose big banks and investment firms over smaller financial advisors because they think the brand name and size makes the service and product offerings better.

Lately it’s hit home for me, though, because two of my high school friends were diagnosed with cancer over the last year. Both are in remission now, thankfully, but it brings home the fact that it never hurts to be prepared.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is: if you&#8217;re old enough to be filing your taxes this month, you&#8217;re old enough to take basic steps to create basic estate documents. And yes, things will evolve and there will be adjustments to make over your &#8211; hopefully &#8211; long and prosperous life. But it&#8217;s never too early to get started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The single most important thing we all need is a <b>will</b> and/or <b>account beneficiaries</b>, so that it&#8217;s clear where you want your assets to go. Statistics show that not only do most young people not have a will, but that most young parents who do have wills haven’t updated them when they had a second or third child. At the very least make sure you&#8217;ve named beneficiaries for all your bank and investment accounts (also known as TOD or  &#8220;transfer on death&#8221; provisions), to prevent having the courts probate and decide how to transfer your assets. If you need help we can connect you with our excellent network of Washington area professionals who can advise you about making the best choices for you and your loved ones.</li>\n<li>If you have kids, naming <strong>guardians</strong> for them is critical, to protect them should the unthinkable happen.</li>\n<li>And don&#8217;t forget yourself! My mother just had knee replacement surgery about two weeks ago and, just before she did, she handed me her <strong>advanced medical directive</strong>. I was grateful she did (she&#8217;s fine!) and your loved ones will be grateful to know what your preferences are if they ever need to make decisions for you. In addition to a life insurance policy, don&#8217;t forget <strong>disability insurance</strong> in case for some reason you can&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ve never had to use the policy I took out in my 20s but I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s there.</li>\n<li>And finally, why not create a <strong>notebook or file </strong>where all your important documents are handy? It&#8217;s a great habit to get into when you’re young. Or you could gather your documents in a tool like the <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/client-portal/\">online document vault</a> our clients have access to. So take a moment and get organized &#8211; most likely you wont need it for a long time but you&#8217;ll have created a great habit for yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>April is a great time for an overall financial check-up: you have all your tax documents organized, which means it will be that much easier to get these important personal documents organized as well. April is also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Literacy_Month\">Financial Literacy Month</a> so, as always, call us if you have questions or for a free consultation and financial check-up.</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/9f2d5/Age-based-1.png","srcSet":"/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/91db1/Age-based-1.png 100w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/dc47e/Age-based-1.png 200w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/9f2d5/Age-based-1.png 400w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/fa42c/Age-based-1.png 600w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/90823/Age-based-1.png 800w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/67331/Age-based-1.png 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"640c5213-4c9c-50af-bee9-c7d888882a64","slug":"fiduciary-rule-courts","title":"The Imperfect Fiduciary Rule just got Worse","content":"<p>Last Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule, stating that it was &#8220;unreasonable&#8217; that brokers handling investors’ retirement savings should be required to only act in clients’ best interest.</p>\n<p>Unreasonable for advisors to only act in their clients&#8217; best interests? Let that sink in for a moment&#8230;</p>\n<p>In a nutshell: it&#8217;s still considered acceptable in the financial industry for advisors to give clients advice that is <em>less than the best for the clients</em> when it yields a higher commission for the broker.</p>\n<p>In case you were wondering, the plaintiffs challenging the DOL&#8217;s Fiduciary Rule were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Financial Services Institute, Financial Services Roundtable, and Insured Retirement Institute. None of whom, clearly, are friends to the individual investor.</p>\n<p>Because different Courts&#8217; decisions have not been consistent about this Obama Administration effort to protect individual advisors, there is speculation the question will climb at some point to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiduciary-rule-fight-drags-on-for-financial-firms-1521230901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supreme Court</a>, so this isn&#8217;t over. And while the Fiduciary Rule was not perfect, this is clearly worse.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, what can you as an individual investor do to make sure your interests are not being sacrificed for the benefit of your advisor? Very simple: make sure your advisor is ALREADY a Fiduciary. And if they&#8217;re not, switch. Why leave your money in a big brokerage house where conflicts of interest and commissions potentially eat into your gains and your future? Or where &#8211; instead of being given the full picture &#8211; you&#8217;re being steered toward a product that isn&#8217;t the best possible choice for you because of brokers&#8217; sales goals or &#8220;contests&#8221;?</p>\n<p>Individual investors have the power to tell the industry that this is unacceptable by voting with their feet (or computers.) Choose an advisor who has sworn to uphold the Fiduciary Standard and ONLY recommend choices that are in your best interest.</p>\n<p>Just because the 5th Circuit is willing to settle for less doesn&#8217;t mean you should.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re concerned you&#8217;re not getting the fullest picture about what&#8217;s right for you and the best, un-conflicted advice, give us a call for a free portfolio review or learn more about our fee-only, Fiduciary approach.</em></p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/9f2d5/Age-based-1.png","srcSet":"/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/91db1/Age-based-1.png 100w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/dc47e/Age-based-1.png 200w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/9f2d5/Age-based-1.png 400w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/fa42c/Age-based-1.png 600w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/90823/Age-based-1.png 800w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/67331/Age-based-1.png 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"3be45763-7d3a-599e-b829-4ad386417bbc","slug":"want-get-financially-fit-2018-set-savings-goals-now","title":"Want to Get More &#8220;Financially Fit&#8221; in 2018?

The solution is to make sure your goals are SMART goals: goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and linked to a Timetable.</p>\n<p>It is important to set<strong> S</strong>pecific and <strong>R</strong>elevant immediate, short, and long-term savings goals that you can visualize &#8211; like a beach vacation, a bigger home, or a child’s graduation ceremony. Tying savings goals to images that align with your life and your values can make them more emotionally compelling and easier to keep in mind.</p>\n<p>Equally critical is to make your goals <strong>M</strong>easurable and set a <strong>T</strong>imetable: how much you are planning to save each month, or by a certain date. Don’t set figures or dates that are impossible; make sure they are <strong>A</strong>ttainable as well.</p>\n<p>Just like physical fitness, financial fitness is best achieved by setting specific, achievable, and measurable goals. A defined goal, whether it’s “save 5% of each paycheck” or “add extra hours to save for a vacation,” gives you a much better shot at success rather than a simple “I should be saving more.”</p>\n<p>A huge part of good financial planning is goal setting. A good financial planner can help you calculate the long-term benefits of saving more and on a regular sustainable basis. It’s particularly important that your financial planner is a <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\">fee-only Fiduciary</a>: that means there will be no “additional charges” or investment recommendations with commissions for the broker that could throw off your savings calculations.</p>\n<p>And if you’d like help defining financial goals and evaluating whether you are saving enough to achieve them, please feel free to<a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"> contact me</a> for a free introductory call.

Gone are the days of the easy mortgages, the no-income-verification loans, and The Big Short. In fact, qualifying for a mortgage may rank as one of the biggest challenges you face as someone who is self-employed.</p>\n<p>And if that weren’t stressful enough, with recent signals from the Fed that mortgage rates may be rising in 2018, you probably want to act quickly to pre-qualify if you’re considering a move.</p>\n<p>As a self-employed business owner who just bought a new home for our growing family, I can testify that the mortgage process is not for the faint-hearted. Every time I completed a lender’s checklist they come back to me for more information. This was not my first mortgage but the time and energy it took this time around was beyond what I expected &#8211; and I’m a credit-worthy borrower and financial pro with a background in the mortgage world.</p>\n<p>So what’s the best way to prepare? To understand the issues, think like a bank. In deciding to lend you hundreds of thousands of dollars, the bank wants to know, first and foremost, that you will be able to pay them back &#8211; steadily, regularly, over time.</p>\n<p>Here are 3 of the biggest hurdles you may have to overcome:</p>\n<p><strong>SHOW YOU MEET THE INCOME REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing a potential lender asks to see is your W-2 form, the document that shows salaried workers’ annual wages and withheld taxes. Business owners and independent contractors are unlikely to have W2s, and instead need to present their full tax returns, including profit &amp; loss and deductions &amp; depreciation, as well as their own income.</p>\n<p>Not only are lenders not likely to be expert at understanding your business and your cash flow, but the salary you show on paper may be deceptively low. That’s because most business owners invest a sizable chunk “back into the business” when they’re getting started as well as taking deductions for travel, leased vehicles, and purchases of computers, office supplies, and even their phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> If you’re thinking about buying a house, consult a financial planner, your accountant, or a trusted mortgage professional (we’ve suggested a few below) about how much to accurately deduct – or not &#8211; this year to show sufficient income and an acceptable debt-to-income ratio.</p>\n<p><strong>HAVE ALL THE PAPERWORK</strong></p>\n<p>Having paperwork that tells the full story can make all the difference, so now is the perfect time to prepare a file with the documents you’ve already collected for the IRS. Remember, though, that this year’s tax returns and records may not be enough to show your business has been steadily growing. Be prepared with records from previous years, and bonus points for data about how your sector has been doing as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready</strong>: Keeping good records is key so if you haven’t already started, get started now, and see what you can put together for previous years.</p>\n<p><strong>MAKE SENSE OF COMPLEXITY </strong></p>\n<p>Every company and every consultant is unique and it may be hard to reconcile your business’ specific challenges and trajectory with the solid predictability a mortgage lender is looking for. You may want to bring a trusted accountant or financial or business advisor to the meeting with the lender – someone who knows your business well and can explain its structure, operations, and cash flow in context. If your advisor can’t be there, ask them to write a brief document explaining your data. Consider also requesting profit-and-loss statements prepared without personal expenses to show the difference between reported income and actual income.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> be prepared to explain what your numbers mean in context and turn to a trusted advisor, if possible, who can translate your numbers for the lender and help them understand you’re a good candidate.</p>\n<p><strong>AVOID CREDIT SCORE SURPRISES</strong></p>\n<p>You wouldn’t be the first, or last, person to find discrepancies in your <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\">credit score</a>. Correct any discrepancies and make sure it’s correctly updated <em>before</em> applying for a mortgage. And – obviously – pay off any outstanding debt.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> get credit reports from the major agencies and make sure that they are accurate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you’re in the market for a new home, let us help you and guide you through the process.

The good news is that benefit has now been expanded: you’ll be able to withdraw up to $10,000 per year per student for <strong>elementary, middle, and high school tuition</strong> if your child attends or will attend a private or religious school. And, if you’ve already been saving for K-12 with a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/saving-for-college-529-plans/\">Coverdell ESA</a>, you can also rollover that account to a 529 plan without tax consequences.</p>\n<h4><strong>Saving by Off-Setting State Taxes </strong></h4>\n<p>The new 2018 tax law limits deductions for your state income and property taxes to $10,000, so you might find yourself paying more state tax this year. But if you live in one of the 34 states that offers a <strong>state tax deduction for contributions to a 529 plan</strong>, you can lower your state taxes by contributing more to your 529. In most states you have to be enrolled in one of that state’s own plans to take the deduction, but several allow you to deduct contributions from <em>any</em> state plan. And, if you live in one of the several states whose 529 plans include state tax credits, you could also find yourself paying considerably less.</p>\n<h4><strong>Turbo Charging the Benefits for Younger Children</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>529 plans allow “front-loading</strong>,” a term for making up to five years of contributions at once. This not only allows you to “catch up” for a child already in elementary or secondary school, it also allows you to maximize state tax deductions or credits. And anyone can make contributions to your child’s 529 plan. Friends and relatives can each contribute up to $15,000 per recipient, they can also “front-load” up to five years of contributions as well, maximizing their own tax savings. Additionally, if they make direct payments to services provided for beneficiaries’ tuition or medical expenses, these expenses would be tax-free, even though the costs surpass the annual gift tax exclusion.</p>\n<h4><strong>New Benefits for Special Needs Students</strong></h4>\n<p>The new tax law allows <strong>assets in 529 accounts to be transferred to ABLE accounts</strong> without any penalties as long as they are transferred by 2025. ABLE plans &#8211; named for the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act &#8211; are designed to provide tax-favored savings for people with disabilities without limiting their access to benefits such as Medicaid, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The annual contribution cap for ABLE plans is $15,000 and an account can reach $100,000 without affecting SSI benefits. You can also make tax-free withdrawals when paying for expenses such as housing, legal fees and employment trainings.</p>\n<h4><strong>Plans Can Be Transferred to Another Child</strong></h4>\n<p>If you no longer need the account for the child it was created for, <strong>you can change the plan’s beneficiary to another family member</strong>, saving you the income tax on 529 earnings and 10% federal penalty you pay if you withdraw money for non-educational purposes.</p>\n<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>\n<p>Every parent – and grandparent &#8211; should consider opening one or more 529 accounts for their children’s education. There is no limit to the number of plans you can contribute to, or the number of accounts that can be opened for any child, so study up to determine which plans make the most sense for you. But remember: each state’s rules are different so – like your kids – you’ll want to do your homework.</p>\n<p>Then, as with all smart savings plans, contribute on a regular basis over time, through market ups and downs, to benefit from dollar cost averaging and watch your interest compound – and your child’s educational opportunities grow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>For how the new tax law affects the &#8220;Kiddie Tax&#8221; for Uniform Gifts and Transfers to Minors (UGMAs and UTMAs) <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/kiddie-tax-education/\">please click here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>At Sherman Wealth Management we’re passionate about children’s education so please give us a call if you have any questions about your state’s 529 options.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article initially appeared on <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/changes-529-plans-offer-tax-advantages/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\"/>\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/9f2d5/Age-based-1.png","srcSet":"/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/91db1/Age-based-1.png 100w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/dc47e/Age-based-1.png 200w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/9f2d5/Age-based-1.png 400w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/fa42c/Age-based-1.png 600w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/90823/Age-based-1.png 800w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/67331/Age-based-1.png 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c574f867-a6eb-50d6-a711-bbf17a8395e2","slug":"kiddie-tax-education","title":"The &#8220;Kiddie Tax&#8221; is Changing: What You Need to Know Now","content":"<p>Saving on taxes, while saving for your child or grandchild’s college education, just got a little trickier thanks to important changes in the “Kiddie Tax”.</p>\n<p>The tax bill that was signed into law in December made some significant changes to how Uniform Gifts to Minors Accounts (UGMAs) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Accounts (UTMAs) are taxed.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is the “Kiddie Tax”?</strong></h3>\n<p>“The “Kiddie Tax” was first established in 1986 to keep parents from shielding income by placing investment accounts in the names of their children, who typically are in lower income tax brackets,” explains CPA Joshua Harris of <a href=\"http://www.santospostal.com/\">Santos, Postal &amp; Company</a>. “The initial Kiddie Tax rules expired when a child turned 14. In 2008, this threshold increased to cover children through age 18 and full time students through age 23.”</p>\n<h3><strong>How were Uniform Gifts and Transfers Taxed?</strong></h3>\n<p>UGMAs and UTMAs have been a popular way to save money in a child&#8217;s or grandchild’s name precisely because of their significant tax advantages. A portion of the money earned &#8211; the first $1,050 of the child’s investment income (including interest, dividends and capital gains distributions) has been tax-free; the next $1,050 has taxed at the child’s rate; and investment income above $2,100 was taxed at the parent’s or grandparent’s “marginal” tax rate, ie the highest rate applied to the last dollar earned.</p>\n<h3><strong>How is it Changing?</strong></h3>\n<p>The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made an important change to this graduated “Kiddie Tax.”</p>\n<p>Instead of a child’s investment income above $2,100 being taxed at the parent or grandparent’s individual tax rate, it will be taxed at the 2018 trust and estate tax rates:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 269px;\" width=\"831\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Investment Income</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Trust &amp; Estate Tax Rate</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Up to $2,550</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$2,551-$9,150</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$9,151-$12,500</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Over $12,500</td>\n<td>37%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>Will You Pay More or Less?</strong></h3>\n<p>How much you will pay depends on the amount of investment income and your own marginal tax bracket. As a rule of thumb, the more you have the more you may be taxed this year.</p>\n<p>While the Tax Code changed with this law, it unfortunately did not get simpler. And one alternative, if your rates are going up, may be to consider rolling the UTMA or UGMA into a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/saving-for-college-529-plans/\">529 plan</a>. Because of the complexity, it’s a good idea to speak with your Financial Planner about how the new law affects you, and what your best alternatives are now among the wide array of educational savings plans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\">give us a call</a> if you’d like to schedule a free consultation.</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/0a0e5f6f831e5c7122d2b6b3f2d6bb24/da113/planning-tips-new-parents-1280x720-1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0a0e5f6f831e5c7122d2b6b3f2d6bb24/3f132/planning-tips-new-parents-1280x720-1-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/0a0e5f6f831e5c7122d2b6b3f2d6bb24/8850c/planning-tips-new-parents-1280x720-1-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/0a0e5f6f831e5c7122d2b6b3f2d6bb24/da113/planning-tips-new-parents-1280x720-1-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/0a0e5f6f831e5c7122d2b6b3f2d6bb24/7223d/planning-tips-new-parents-1280x720-1-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/0a0e5f6f831e5c7122d2b6b3f2d6bb24/f2cbb/planning-tips-new-parents-1280x720-1-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/0a0e5f6f831e5c7122d2b6b3f2d6bb24/356ef/planning-tips-new-parents-1280x720-1-1.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"8993eb8a-f085-5a73-9d97-ac4d44bddbcc","slug":"shocked-markets-drop-chalk-recency-bias","title":"Shocked by the Market’s Drop?

It’s hard not to panic if your oldest child is in college and her 529 just took a hit or if you’re a year away from retirement and your IRA just lost 15% of it’s paper value.</p>\n<p>Although you no doubt know that impulsive trading is one of the least efficient ways to reach your true long-term investment potential, emotions are powerful drivers. In fact, in Robert Shiller&#8217;s book “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsz9d9vjLzY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m16s\">Irrational Exuberance,&#8221;</a> he states that the emotional state of investors “is no doubt one of the most important factors causing the bull market” we just recently experienced.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows that investor sentiment dropped 30% in the beginning of the year, suggesting that investors’ overall attitude may have been veering from bullish to bearish, although it did bounce back this week.  What it also suggests is that Recency Bias caused investors’ to react more strongly to typical market volatility because it was a-typical during the long period of calm we just experienced.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-4143 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-300x134.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-300x134.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-768x343.png 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1.png 1002w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The key in times of volatility is to keep your eye on your long-term goals rather than reacting impulsively to temporary trends. In <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/learn-loss.asp#ixzz56deq33Dq\">Taking The Sting Out Of Investment Loss</a><u>,</u> Brian Boch advises: “The golden rule is to differentiate between [decisions] based on rational and prudent trading strategies on the one hand and emotionally-based, panicky decisions on the other. The former generally leads to success over time, while the latter tends to lead to failure.”</p>\n<p>Here at Sherman Wealth Management we believe there is productivity and security in planning for the unknown by defining what it is you already <u>do</u> know. Knowing yourself, your emotions, and the risk you are willing to take is the first step. The second is creating a long-term financial plan with a conflict-free, Fiduciary advisor.</p>\n<p>In a recent post, <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2018/02/the-drawbacks-of-behavioral-finance-during-a-market-correction/\"><u>Ben Carlson</u></a> wrote:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The prep time for a market correction or crash comes well before it actually happens by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting realistic expectations.</li>\n<li>Mapping out a course of attack for when losses occur.</li>\n<li>Making decisions ahead of time about what moves (if any) to make and when depending on what happens.</li>\n<li>Deciding on the correct level of risk to be taken.</li>\n<li>Building behaviorally-aware portfolios.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best solution to financial <em>and</em> emotional volatility is to work with a financial planner on a plan that will make you feel comfortable through the market’s natural ups <u>and</u> downs.

Things might look a little different though, if your child’s 529 plan funds just shrank, or if you’re nearing retirement and are counting on an IRA and a 401K, or if you were just about to take some earnings to finance an important project.</p>\n<p>Notice how you felt on Monday as the market dropped again: it’s a good insight into your current risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>Market values have increased dramatically in the last few years and in 2017 in particular. This current market volatility comes after the longest period in history without a correction and with remarkably <em>low</em> volatility. As a result, Friday’s sell off and Monday’s drop may have been a bit of a shock, even though a 5% drop was not unusual as recently as 2016. That makes it particularly difficult to anticipate what will happen next, in the direct short term, since investors may react unpredictably, including too many people who are driven by how they guess <em>others</em> will react.</p>\n<p>There are two important things to remember when the market is volatile. The first is that volatility and risk are not the same thing: volatility is a normal variation in value, risk is the possibility that an investment will fail. The second is that it&#8217;s important to look at trends over time, not just yesterday&#8217;s news.

It may sound like a foreign concept to some, but for many simply having their own emotions attached to their personal finances, make it too close for comfort. They say anytime emotions are involved logic can go out the window. Let us help remind you of the logic of needs vs. wants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is a need? Human basic needs are as simple as food, water, and shelter, therefore, your monthly mortgage or rent payment, monthly food and beverage expenses, and we can also add transportation i.e. car payment, insurance, and gas all go into this category. What may seem shocking to some is that everything else is a want. In the complicated consumer driven world we live in it may be hard to fathom, but if it isn’t necessary for your survival it is a desire, not a necessity. And furthermore, if it’s a materialistic good rather than an intangible experience, experts say you probably won’t even miss it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ok now that we’ve defined a want and a need, lets practice an exercise. According to David Bach, author of “The Automatic Millionaire” “Becoming rich requires nothing more than committing and sticking to a systematic savings and investment plan” <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/self-made-millionaire-got-life-changing-money-advice-at-age-7.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/self-made-millionaire-got-life-changing-money-advice-at-age-7.html</a> Ready to get started now? Take out a piece of paper and pen. Create two categories; wants and needs. Start listing everything you spend money on in a month. Determine whether it is a want or need. Create another list. Write your future goals. Picture yourself taking the vacation you’ve dreamed of for years, or retiring early. Whatever your goals are, visualize yourself completing them. Now return to your list of wants and needs. How can you “trim the fat” on your daily spending habits so you really can save more for the things that will fulfill you later. For example : One easy fat trimmer is to shop around for things you already are paying for. Items such as your cell phone, cable, internet, and insurance can easily be shopped around for a lower price. Visualizing yourself completing your long term goals can help motivate you to sacrifice temporary gratification for something that may lead to a happier you in the long run. Now you can put more towards your retirement, so you can vacation permanently, sooner!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, what tools will you need to implement to further achieve your goals? Personally, my wife and I are big fans of technology that track our spending, keep us honest and transparent by categorizing each purchase through linking our credit card spending and automatically deducting the budget category the purchase must be subtracted from. Theres nothing to hide when you make a budget, add all of your credit cards, and promise to stick to it. We’ve also found that being realistic and making achievable goals ensures we are more successful, but you know what makes us the most successful? Having a financial plan! Sherman Wealth Management uses tools that will link users accounts so we have access to your budget and balances and can help you come up with a financial plan right for you. Also by hiring a fee only fiduciary financial advisor whose emotions aren’t involved in our spending habits we’ve no longer clouded our logic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Still have your reservations? A study at Princeton found that every 10% rise in annual income moves people up the life satisfaction ladder the same amount, whether they’re making $25,000. Or $100,000. “High incomes don’t bring you happiness, but they do bring you a life you think is better.” That being said; What if we all gave ourselves a 10% rise in income by trimming the fat in our expenses and adding the profit to our bottom line further assisting us in accomplishing our goals.  What if we found that we possess the power and control to increase our actual happiness by simply living with less, saving more, and reaching our goals by following through with them? And what if by living with less we are more fulfilled.  Studies have proven that having less and living more simply does lead to greater overall life satisfaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feeling like you could use some help?

Sadly, it’s not just one person’s perspective. It’s a sentiment that is shared by the 40-50% of Americans who believe that winning the lottery is the only way they can get what they need for retirement.</p>\n<p>The odds of winning a Powerball have recently been calculated to be 1 in 292,000,000. As a financial advisor, I am frustrated by an investment strategy that is based on a verifiably unrealistic longshot. That frustration is only compounded by the fact that there is a simple solution! The real winning ticket to ensure you can live comfortably in retirement is not a lottery ticket, but rather a concept you likely have heard of but brushed aside: compound interest.</p>\n<p>It’s Been Said That Albert Einstein Called Compound Interest the Eighth Wonder of the World</p>\n<p>And even if he didn’t, it’s still a brilliant investing tool. Simply put, compounding is a process which generates additional return on an asset’s reinvested earnings. To be effective, it requires two simple things: the reinvestment of earnings, and time. If properly managed, compound interest can help your initial investment grow exponentially. For those of you who enjoy math, here’s the formula:</p>\n<p>Ending $$ = Beginning $$ * (1 + return) ^ total time frame of compounding</p>\n<p>While this is a useful strategy for all investors, for young investors in particular, it is the greatest investing tool for long-term growth, and the #1 argument in support of starting as early as possible. Just look at the graph below, which represents the growth of $100 over 30 years:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can see that without reinvestment, the return potential is significantly reduced no matter what the rate of return is. This is important to understand because many investors are tempted to capitalize on their gains too early. The results reflected in this graph make it clear that choosing to instead reinvest those gains is going to make a significant difference in the long run.</p>\n<p>The best advice for how to implement this strategy and maximize your long-run returns is to (1) postpone gains, and (2) rebalance efficiently. When tempted to take a short-term gain, always ask yourself: do you really need to sell? If not, don’t. Committing to a long-range investment strategy will make a world of difference in your returns. And when rebalancing, instead of creating a tax event by taking gains, consider allocating future proceeds into holdings that have underperformed.</p>\n<p>Compounding interest becomes more complicated when the effect of taxes is factored in. Investors are often not able to reinvest all of the money that has been paid out because the government takes its cut. In order to get around this, you should try to minimize the effects of taxes by putting money into tax efficient accounts; ensuring that tax inefficient assets/strategies are in kept in retirement accounts; allocating assets to tax efficient areas of the market such as municipal bonds and real estate; and utilizing ETFs to delay tax events for stock holdings.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be Einstein to understand the power of compounding interest. Instead of putting your fate in the hands of the lottery, take control of your retirement plan through smart, well-thought-out investment decisions.

similar growth trend in the chart below.  We can see that while asset levels for actively managed mutual funds are still eight times higher than ETF asset levels, there is a staggering difference in their annualized growth rates.  While mutual funds are barely growing at .8%, ETF assets are growing at a pace of 21.4%.  </span></p>\n<p><a

400;\">The conclusion is clear: ETFs took in more than three times the net inflows in the first half of 2017 because </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the world is changing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Millennials are seeking out the funds as an alternative to traditional mutual funds in response to the changing environment around them, the preference for low-fees, and the flexibility of being able to trade in and out of the funds as frequently and as quickly as they desire.  The faster that advisors start to recognize and adapt to that changing world, the better they are able to meet the needs and desires of their clients.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we understand that our clients are seeking low-cost, diversified portfolios and as a fiduciary, we feel it is our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities posed by ETFs.  We were one of the early adopters of these diversified funds because we saw the value of having a low-cost, tax-efficient portfolio that, if done wisely, can be combined to meet target allocations that have diversification benefits creating worthwhile risk-adjusted returns.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see ETFs as an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">opportunity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of competition.  Instead of individual stock picking, ETFs give us the ability to spend our time focusing on a top-down approach to asset allocation.  This means assessing where the opportunities lie within different asset classes and combining attractive ETFs in these</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> high-probability sandboxes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a way that we feel will maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Instead of the cookie-cutter allocation achieved by working with robo-advisors, we have real people putting together your portfolio and looking under the hood of these funds to ensure that they are the best pick for you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we want to be ahead of the times &#8211; not stuck lamenting the past.  </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So… just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times.  </span></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:

Orrin Hatch, Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady) might not have learned as much as they could have from the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which arguably was defeated due to a lack of clear details and shortage of bipartisan support.  In a repeat tactic, the push for passing the bill under “budget reconciliation” would require only a simple majority in the Senate to pass the law.  But it should be noted that this can only happen if projections show that the total revenue differential over the next 10 years is $1.5 trillion or less.  Right now, </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2017/09/27/release-of-gops-long-awaited-tax-plan-reveals-exactly-why-tax-reform-is-so-hard/#35ce89314597\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projections</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> place it at $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.  That means the GOP will either need bipartisan Senate support with 60 votes or find $1 million in reduced projections.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the highlights of the proposed plan and how they could impact your personal income taxes if they should be passed:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fewer Tax Brackets</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Instead of the seven tax brackets we face today ranging from 10% to 39.6%, the new plan proposes only three: 12%, 25%, and 35%.  Because the plan does not specify where these cut-offs will be, though, we can only speculate on how these will impact individuals positively or negatively.  If speculation is correct, those currently facing 28% and 33% tax rates would see a tax cut to the new 25% rate, which would be beneficial.  The idea of adding a fourth bracket for the wealthiest Americans has also been floated.\n<p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Doubles the Standard Deduction, but Eliminates Personal Exemptions <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; The marketing tactic for the bill is that it is a huge break to middle-class Americans by doubling the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for single filers and from $12,000 to $24,000 for joint filers.\n<p></span></b><b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a catch, though</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  These increases are being offset by the elimination of personal exemptions. The result is what seems like a 50% increase to most taxpayers, in reality, is closer to 15%.</p>\n<p></span></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Reduction of Elimination of Itemized Deductions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; If in the past you have chosen to itemize your deductions, you could be getting the short end of the stick here.  The plan calls for reductions or elimination of many itemized deductions, without providing specifics on which ones.  It has only been stated that they will keep the deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions.  It also mentions benefits that encourage work, higher education and retirement savings, but provides no details on these.\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The largest red flag for many is concerning the elimination of state and local tax deductions.  Currently, you can deduct what you pay in state and local taxes from your federal income bill.  If this is eliminated, it could disproportionately affect those who live in high-tax states such as Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California, and Maryland.  Only two days after the plan was released, objections from Blue-state Republicans have caused them to reconsider eliminating these deductions.<br />\n</span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\nAdditionally, homeowners or anyone paying real estate taxes will see that their property taxes are no longer deductible under the new plan.  Again, this will have a disproportionately large impact for those living in states with high real estate taxes.<br />\n</span></b>Below is a breakdown of what the new and old tax brackets could look like for single filers:<i><span><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4073 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"814\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1.png 1251w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-300x125.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-1024x427.png 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-768x320.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px\" /></a></span></i><i><span>Source</span></i><span>: </span><span><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tax-plan-details-corporate-rate-individual-brackets-deductions-cuts-2017-9?nr_email_referer=1&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=PoliticsSelect&amp;pt=385758&amp;ct=Sailthru_BI_Newsletters&amp;mt=8&amp;utm_campaign=BI%20Politics%202017-09-28&amp;utm_term=Politics%20Select%20-%20Engaged%2C%20Active%2C%20Passive%2C%20Disengaged\">Business Insider</a></p>\n<p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Changes for Families</b><span>&#8211; There may be some significant changes to the tax code surrounding families as well, including single parents and households with two or more children.\n<p></span>Currently, single parents fall into a favorable tax bracket somewhere in between single and married-filing-joint rates as well as a 50% boost to their standard deduction.  The new plan would likely eliminate this, meaning single parents could face higher rates.</p>\n<p>That being said, these cuts could potentially be offset by an unspecified “significant increase” to the Child Tax Credit.  Depending on the size of this Child Tax Credit, households with a two or more children could also see increased rates because of the elimination of the exemption based on the number of children.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Eliminates the Death Tax and Alternative Minimum Tax</b><span> &#8211; The estate (“death”) tax only currently applies to 0.14% of Americans, whose assets exceeded $10.9 million and did not hire a competent estate planner.  So this likely does not affect you, but it would be eliminated under this plan.\n<p></span>The alternative minimum tax forces those who have an outsized number of deductions to pay an alternative tax rate instead.  The truth is, very few people understand it anyway.  This is likely a good thing, especially if the goal is simplicity.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Small Businesses, including ours!<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; In terms of small-business owners, there is a whole separate set of changes to be considered.  For ‘pass-through’ businesses like ours, the plan wants to lower the maximum rate from 39.6% to 25%, which is particularly appealing to making smaller firms more competitive.\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Questions still surround this due, though, to Steve Mnuchin’s </span><a href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/09/12/mnuchin-some-services-companies-wont-get-pass-through-tax-rate-update.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vague statements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding limitations on what types of businesses will get this lowered rate as well as how they will distinguish between personal income and business income.  Additionally, many have pointed out that nine in 10 businesses that pass through their income already pay at the 25% rate or less, meaning this change could be ultimately inconsequential.</p>\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For larger corporations, the plan proposes lowering the tax rate from 35% to 20% and a one-time repatriation of overseas assets at an unspecified lower rate.   </span></b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions related to your specific situation, don’t hesitate to contact us </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  We will keep you updated as more developments are made and the plan evolves.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.  They are for information purposes only.
