While college enrollment and the number of college graduates has continued to increase, financial literacy lags among these young people at record lows. Where does this disconnect come from?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few states offer personal finance or economics courses and even fewer states test students on the financial knowledge they have acquired. It therefore comes as no surprise that American students (and we can infer American adults) have one of the lowest levels of financial literacy when compared to other countries.  While the number of student loans has increased,</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>44% of Americans don’t have enough cash to cover a $400 emergency</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>43% of student loan borrowers are not making payments</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>38% of U.S. households have credit card debt</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>33% of American adults have $0 saved for retirement</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why does it matter? How is it affecting the economy?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are graduating with loans they can’t afford to pay back and with minimal financial knowledge in planning for their futures. According to <a href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/\">Student Loan Hero</a>, Americans have over $1.48 trillion in student loan debt, which is more </span><a href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">than double</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the total U.S. credit card debt of $620 billion. This debt is becoming a major barrier to home ownership. 43% of student loan borrowers are not making payments and most of these individuals do not have any </span><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nearly-half-dont-have-the-cash-to-pay-for-a-400-emergency-fed-survey-finds-2017-05-19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">savings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A lack of sound financial knowledge will affect the economy as these millennials enter the labor force burdened with student loans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As parents, we play a vital role in educating our children about the importance of personal finances.  In the Sherman household, we are teaching our children the importance of finances on a daily basis. Our 4 year old son is learning about savings by doing chores in return for an allowance, which he saves in his piggy bank. He is learning to save and spend his money wisely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents can begin educating their children at home in order to increase the financial literacy of their kids. By demonstrating wise financial habits, parents can serve as role models for their kids. Talking in an age appropriate way to your children about the dangers of debt and the importance of saving a portion of any money they earn instills financial values and lessons your child can use throughout life.  You may find that using an allowance is a way that you can teach your kids about saving and spending appropriately. Since it has been shown that kids who manage their own money have been found to demonstrate better financial habits in the future, giving your kids the opportunity to spend and save their own allowance or money earned is a good way to prepare them for later on. Even a simple trip to the store can be used as an opportunity to start the conversation about the danger of credit cards and how they should only be used in an emergency.  Educating your kids at an early age will enable them to better learn and practice sound financial habits while under your watchful eye and cause them to be less likely to make irrational decisions once they are out on their own. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4265 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-300x225.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1-768x576.png 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/managing-money-1.png 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This issue is not only affecting students and young adults.  Many professionals with advanced degrees have spent countless hours studying and researching information in their particular field.  Despite all of the hours spent earning their degrees, many of these people have never taken a single course in financial education and are surprisingly not prepared to deal with the important financial decisions affecting their futures.  As a result, many extremely smart and successful people are making critical financial errors which can negatively impact the amount of money they have saved upon retirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in 2011, studies were conducted where participants were shown a computer generated rendering of what they might look like at their age of retirement.  They were then asked to make financial decisions about whether to spend their money today or save that money for the future. In each study, those individuals who were shown pictures of their future selves allocated more than twice as much money towards their retirement accounts than those who did not see the age-progressed images.  Seeing the images gave the participants a connection with their future selves that they did not possess before. As a result, their spending/saving behavior changed dramatically because “saving is like a choice between spending money today or giving it to a stranger years from now.”</span></p>\n<p>The benefits of educating your children about the importance of personal finances are undeniable, and you&#8217;ll be able to set them up for a promising future and help them prepare for retirement. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com\">Visit us online</a> for more information about how we can help improve your financial life.</p>\n<div>\n<p><!-- [if mso]>\n\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\n<w:anchorlock/>\n\n<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\n</v:roundrect>\n\n<![endif]--><a style=\"background-color: #34cc09; background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif'); border: 1px solid #1e3650; border-radius: 4px; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 200px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; mso-hide: all;\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.6666666666666667,"src":"/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/26a4d/piggy-bank-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/4e5cc/piggy-bank-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/5398f/piggy-bank-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/26a4d/piggy-bank-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/bc1d2a313cb210eda90c05c6fff5dba1/03203/piggy-bank-1.jpg 550w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"28ef3241-db01-5518-800a-6adef2200738","slug":"best-interest-rates-cash","title":"Money in Cash?

But is your bank raising your interest rates too or are they pocketing the difference and profiting?

You’re losing money, both in lost interest and because inflation can reduce the value of your savings.</p>\n<p>Do you know if  your own savings account’s interest is keeping pace with rising interest rates? If not, check with your advisor to make sure you are maximizing your money’s earning power. If you&#8217;re not, consider shopping for a higher rate.

Most broker-dealers in large wire houses have only agreed to uphold the &#8220;suitability&#8221; standard, which means they are allowed to recommend investments that are &#8220;suitable&#8221; &#8211; not best &#8211; for you but potentially yield a markup for their company or bonus or commission for them.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re unclear about what fees you are paying, share classes you own, or how much your funds are costing you in annual expenses, <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\">contact us</a> for a free analysis of your currents investments and the costs associated with them.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Particularly during Financial Literacy Month, make sure your Financial Advisor is working for <em><u>you</u></em>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.77,"src":"/static/e4fa6997b303ae2acfa179a757d0191e/cad89/Age-based1-1.png","srcSet":"/static/e4fa6997b303ae2acfa179a757d0191e/1d716/Age-based1-1.png 100w,\n/static/e4fa6997b303ae2acfa179a757d0191e/f0031/Age-based1-1.png 200w,\n/static/e4fa6997b303ae2acfa179a757d0191e/cad89/Age-based1-1.png 400w,\n/static/e4fa6997b303ae2acfa179a757d0191e/d4196/Age-based1-1.png 600w,\n/static/e4fa6997b303ae2acfa179a757d0191e/3995d/Age-based1-1.png 800w,\n/static/e4fa6997b303ae2acfa179a757d0191e/649fb/Age-based1-1.png 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"1e87de41-972b-5cd3-b029-f126598a86d5","slug":"estate-planning-when-young","title":"Your Next-to-the-Last Will and Testament: Estate Planning When You&#8217;re Young","content":"<p>There was an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-prepare-just-in-case-you-die-young-1520220099\">excellent article</a> in the WSJ last week about a topic most of us don’t really want to think about (but really need to:) how to prepare in case you die young.</p>\n<p>No one likes to think about dying and absolutely no one likes to think about the possibility of dying young. Lately it’s hit home for me, though, because two of my high school friends were diagnosed with cancer over the last year. Both are in remission now, thankfully, but it brings home the fact that it never hurts to be prepared.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is: if you&#8217;re old enough to be filing your taxes this month, you&#8217;re old enough to take basic steps to create basic estate documents. And yes, things will evolve and there will be adjustments to make over your &#8211; hopefully &#8211; long and prosperous life. But it&#8217;s never too early to get started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The single most important thing we all need is a <b>will</b> and/or <b>account beneficiaries</b>, so that it&#8217;s clear where you want your assets to go. Statistics show that not only do most young people not have a will, but that most young parents who do have wills haven’t updated them when they had a second or third child. At the very least make sure you&#8217;ve named beneficiaries for all your bank and investment accounts (also known as TOD or  &#8220;transfer on death&#8221; provisions), to prevent having the courts probate and decide how to transfer your assets. If you need help we can connect you with our excellent network of Washington area professionals who can advise you about making the best choices for you and your loved ones.</li>\n<li>If you have kids, naming <strong>guardians</strong> for them is critical, to protect them should the unthinkable happen.</li>\n<li>And don&#8217;t forget yourself! My mother just had knee replacement surgery about two weeks ago and, just before she did, she handed me her <strong>advanced medical directive</strong>. I was grateful she did (she&#8217;s fine!) and your loved ones will be grateful to know what your preferences are if they ever need to make decisions for you. In addition to a life insurance policy, don&#8217;t forget <strong>disability insurance</strong> in case for some reason you can&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ve never had to use the policy I took out in my 20s but I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s there.</li>\n<li>And finally, why not create a <strong>notebook or file </strong>where all your important documents are handy? It&#8217;s a great habit to get into when you’re young. Or you could gather your documents in a tool like the <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/client-portal/\">online document vault</a> our clients have access to. So take a moment and get organized &#8211; most likely you wont need it for a long time but you&#8217;ll have created a great habit for yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>April is a great time for an overall financial check-up: you have all your tax documents organized, which means it will be that much easier to get these important personal documents organized as well. April is also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Literacy_Month\">Financial Literacy Month</a> so, as always, call us if you have questions or for a free consultation and financial check-up.</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.77,"src":"/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/cad89/Age-based-1.png","srcSet":"/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/1d716/Age-based-1.png 100w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/f0031/Age-based-1.png 200w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/cad89/Age-based-1.png 400w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/d4196/Age-based-1.png 600w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/3995d/Age-based-1.png 800w,\n/static/6fbe4cd5de9b80120affcf53eaa1d610/649fb/Age-based-1.png 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"640c5213-4c9c-50af-bee9-c7d888882a64","slug":"fiduciary-rule-courts","title":"The Imperfect Fiduciary Rule just got Worse","content":"<p>Last Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule, stating that it was &#8220;unreasonable&#8217; that brokers handling investors’ retirement savings should be required to only act in clients’ best interest.</p>\n<p>Unreasonable for advisors to only act in their clients&#8217; best interests? Let that sink in for a moment&#8230;</p>\n<p>In a nutshell: it&#8217;s still considered acceptable in the financial industry for advisors to give clients advice that is <em>less than the best for the clients</em> when it yields a higher commission for the broker.</p>\n<p>In case you were wondering, the plaintiffs challenging the DOL&#8217;s Fiduciary Rule were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Financial Services Institute, Financial Services Roundtable, and Insured Retirement Institute. None of whom, clearly, are friends to the individual investor.</p>\n<p>Because different Courts&#8217; decisions have not been consistent about this Obama Administration effort to protect individual advisors, there is speculation the question will climb at some point to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiduciary-rule-fight-drags-on-for-financial-firms-1521230901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supreme Court</a>, so this isn&#8217;t over. And while the Fiduciary Rule was not perfect, this is clearly worse.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, what can you as an individual investor do to make sure your interests are not being sacrificed for the benefit of your advisor? Very simple: make sure your advisor is ALREADY a Fiduciary. And if they&#8217;re not, switch. Why leave your money in a big brokerage house where conflicts of interest and commissions potentially eat into your gains and your future? Or where &#8211; instead of being given the full picture &#8211; you&#8217;re being steered toward a product that isn&#8217;t the best possible choice for you because of brokers&#8217; sales goals or &#8220;contests&#8221;?</p>\n<p>Individual investors have the power to tell the industry that this is unacceptable by voting with their feet (or computers.) Choose an advisor who has sworn to uphold the Fiduciary Standard and ONLY recommend choices that are in your best interest.</p>\n<p>Just because the 5th Circuit is willing to settle for less doesn&#8217;t mean you should.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re concerned you&#8217;re not getting the fullest picture about what&#8217;s right for you and the best, un-conflicted advice, give us a call for a free portfolio review or learn more about our fee-only, Fiduciary approach.</em></p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAABxElEQVQoz61RW0/iUBDmh6//wU1MfPPFTdTEh1UTdU1WiReUXTRSKFoFjtCW3ugFWqil0G/nHCSVNbtPTjI907l8M/NNAZ8sBf7JsuyD/sv/PxWAcyNb6pJhOWkptgD4u+bNX3hDwHQ6w2w21/ey8M31I8j7V0yYEpDheBiEIwyjMcLRGLrliiR/EMINhhjFCeLXRNgB5fHmTDPheAM4/lC8i5pCmk6hvGiI4hhjKkrSVPzzRprZR9ewqEksVLf6ojCZpLipN9E2+mj1HDzrNuotLV+5dNeA7fqYkSOZTFCh5CmtaLsB9ooV3D938fuB4azyAM3yMOGAchseTR4mKTq2D7ndy6+8tX+KsqQQGJ9Wx+7RpQgajo+9SwmvZI+Iv2KNwfZDETu4qKIXREjIrnVM/JJZDnhcLOPL6iY2vhex8vUbtvd/iqBHnK3v/MAVJV83GNa2jhDR6lx2T0o4LEloENjOyTVu5WYOaNJqdaZBpYnuFIZHpoog50pqdqGoFp40G+e3sqCES4uOUm2pYKaLMlHU0a0csD+IILEennQHVeJCdwIR5IdRCOiRVCHiZZqGX5iLSjn8v0mHqb0Y8MOx8P8BFjVDkEv4TpgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","aspectRatio":1.77,"src":"/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/cad89/Age-based-1.png","srcSet":"/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/1d716/Age-based-1.png 100w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/f0031/Age-based-1.png 200w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/cad89/Age-based-1.png 400w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/d4196/Age-based-1.png 600w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/3995d/Age-based-1.png 800w,\n/static/73139b0fea116ad231524bbc135e5db4/649fb/Age-based-1.png 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"3be45763-7d3a-599e-b829-4ad386417bbc","slug":"want-get-financially-fit-2018-set-savings-goals-now","title":"Want to Get More &#8220;Financially Fit&#8221; in 2018?

The solution is to make sure your goals are SMART goals: goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and linked to a Timetable.</p>\n<p>It is important to set<strong> S</strong>pecific and <strong>R</strong>elevant immediate, short, and long-term savings goals that you can visualize &#8211; like a beach vacation, a bigger home, or a child’s graduation ceremony. Tying savings goals to images that align with your life and your values can make them more emotionally compelling and easier to keep in mind.</p>\n<p>Equally critical is to make your goals <strong>M</strong>easurable and set a <strong>T</strong>imetable: how much you are planning to save each month, or by a certain date. Don’t set figures or dates that are impossible; make sure they are <strong>A</strong>ttainable as well.</p>\n<p>Just like physical fitness, financial fitness is best achieved by setting specific, achievable, and measurable goals. A defined goal, whether it’s “save 5% of each paycheck” or “add extra hours to save for a vacation,” gives you a much better shot at success rather than a simple “I should be saving more.”</p>\n<p>A huge part of good financial planning is goal setting. A good financial planner can help you calculate the long-term benefits of saving more and on a regular sustainable basis. It’s particularly important that your financial planner is a <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\">fee-only Fiduciary</a>: that means there will be no “additional charges” or investment recommendations with commissions for the broker that could throw off your savings calculations.</p>\n<p>And if you’d like help defining financial goals and evaluating whether you are saving enough to achieve them, please feel free to<a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-sherman/\"> contact me</a> for a free introductory call.

The tool is designed to help taxpayers make sure they are not wildly underpaying or overpaying what they will owe.</p>\n<p>The new law is highly complex and made changes that included increasing the standard deduction, removing personal exemptions, increasing the child tax credit, limiting or discontinuing certain deductions, and changing the tax rates and brackets.</p>\n<p>The online calculator should go a long way to help employed taxpayers plan ahead, particularly those in middle-income and upper middle-income brackets.</p>\n<p>This is important because you don’t want to be <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\">withholding too much</a> –in effect giving the government a free loan of money you could be investing in your home, the market, educational savings funds, or just your day-to-day needs.

That’s most of us.</p>\n<p>The changes do not affect 2017 tax returns due this April. Your completed 2017 tax return can, however, help you input data to the Withholding Calculator to determine what you should be withholding for 2018 to avoid issues when you file next year.

Gone are the days of the easy mortgages, the no-income-verification loans, and The Big Short. In fact, qualifying for a mortgage may rank as one of the biggest challenges you face as someone who is self-employed.</p>\n<p>And if that weren’t stressful enough, with recent signals from the Fed that mortgage rates may be rising in 2018, you probably want to act quickly to pre-qualify if you’re considering a move.</p>\n<p>As a self-employed business owner who just bought a new home for our growing family, I can testify that the mortgage process is not for the faint-hearted. Every time I completed a lender’s checklist they come back to me for more information. This was not my first mortgage but the time and energy it took this time around was beyond what I expected &#8211; and I’m a credit-worthy borrower and financial pro with a background in the mortgage world.</p>\n<p>So what’s the best way to prepare? To understand the issues, think like a bank. In deciding to lend you hundreds of thousands of dollars, the bank wants to know, first and foremost, that you will be able to pay them back &#8211; steadily, regularly, over time.</p>\n<p>Here are 3 of the biggest hurdles you may have to overcome:</p>\n<p><strong>SHOW YOU MEET THE INCOME REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing a potential lender asks to see is your W-2 form, the document that shows salaried workers’ annual wages and withheld taxes. Business owners and independent contractors are unlikely to have W2s, and instead need to present their full tax returns, including profit &amp; loss and deductions &amp; depreciation, as well as their own income.</p>\n<p>Not only are lenders not likely to be expert at understanding your business and your cash flow, but the salary you show on paper may be deceptively low. That’s because most business owners invest a sizable chunk “back into the business” when they’re getting started as well as taking deductions for travel, leased vehicles, and purchases of computers, office supplies, and even their phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> If you’re thinking about buying a house, consult a financial planner, your accountant, or a trusted mortgage professional (we’ve suggested a few below) about how much to accurately deduct – or not &#8211; this year to show sufficient income and an acceptable debt-to-income ratio.</p>\n<p><strong>HAVE ALL THE PAPERWORK</strong></p>\n<p>Having paperwork that tells the full story can make all the difference, so now is the perfect time to prepare a file with the documents you’ve already collected for the IRS. Remember, though, that this year’s tax returns and records may not be enough to show your business has been steadily growing. Be prepared with records from previous years, and bonus points for data about how your sector has been doing as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready</strong>: Keeping good records is key so if you haven’t already started, get started now, and see what you can put together for previous years.</p>\n<p><strong>MAKE SENSE OF COMPLEXITY </strong></p>\n<p>Every company and every consultant is unique and it may be hard to reconcile your business’ specific challenges and trajectory with the solid predictability a mortgage lender is looking for. You may want to bring a trusted accountant or financial or business advisor to the meeting with the lender – someone who knows your business well and can explain its structure, operations, and cash flow in context. If your advisor can’t be there, ask them to write a brief document explaining your data. Consider also requesting profit-and-loss statements prepared without personal expenses to show the difference between reported income and actual income.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> be prepared to explain what your numbers mean in context and turn to a trusted advisor, if possible, who can translate your numbers for the lender and help them understand you’re a good candidate.</p>\n<p><strong>AVOID CREDIT SCORE SURPRISES</strong></p>\n<p>You wouldn’t be the first, or last, person to find discrepancies in your <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\">credit score</a>. Correct any discrepancies and make sure it’s correctly updated <em>before</em> applying for a mortgage. And – obviously – pay off any outstanding debt.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready:</strong> get credit reports from the major agencies and make sure that they are accurate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you’re in the market for a new home, let us help you and guide you through the process.

The good news is that benefit has now been expanded: you’ll be able to withdraw up to $10,000 per year per student for <strong>elementary, middle, and high school tuition</strong> if your child attends or will attend a private or religious school. And, if you’ve already been saving for K-12 with a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/saving-for-college-529-plans/\">Coverdell ESA</a>, you can also rollover that account to a 529 plan without tax consequences.</p>\n<h4><strong>Saving by Off-Setting State Taxes </strong></h4>\n<p>The new 2018 tax law limits deductions for your state income and property taxes to $10,000, so you might find yourself paying more state tax this year. But if you live in one of the 34 states that offers a <strong>state tax deduction for contributions to a 529 plan</strong>, you can lower your state taxes by contributing more to your 529. In most states you have to be enrolled in one of that state’s own plans to take the deduction, but several allow you to deduct contributions from <em>any</em> state plan. And, if you live in one of the several states whose 529 plans include state tax credits, you could also find yourself paying considerably less.</p>\n<h4><strong>Turbo Charging the Benefits for Younger Children</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>529 plans allow “front-loading</strong>,” a term for making up to five years of contributions at once. This not only allows you to “catch up” for a child already in elementary or secondary school, it also allows you to maximize state tax deductions or credits. And anyone can make contributions to your child’s 529 plan. Friends and relatives can each contribute up to $15,000 per recipient, they can also “front-load” up to five years of contributions as well, maximizing their own tax savings. Additionally, if they make direct payments to services provided for beneficiaries’ tuition or medical expenses, these expenses would be tax-free, even though the costs surpass the annual gift tax exclusion.</p>\n<h4><strong>New Benefits for Special Needs Students</strong></h4>\n<p>The new tax law allows <strong>assets in 529 accounts to be transferred to ABLE accounts</strong> without any penalties as long as they are transferred by 2025. ABLE plans &#8211; named for the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act &#8211; are designed to provide tax-favored savings for people with disabilities without limiting their access to benefits such as Medicaid, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The annual contribution cap for ABLE plans is $15,000 and an account can reach $100,000 without affecting SSI benefits. You can also make tax-free withdrawals when paying for expenses such as housing, legal fees and employment trainings.</p>\n<h4><strong>Plans Can Be Transferred to Another Child</strong></h4>\n<p>If you no longer need the account for the child it was created for, <strong>you can change the plan’s beneficiary to another family member</strong>, saving you the income tax on 529 earnings and 10% federal penalty you pay if you withdraw money for non-educational purposes.</p>\n<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>\n<p>Every parent – and grandparent &#8211; should consider opening one or more 529 accounts for their children’s education. There is no limit to the number of plans you can contribute to, or the number of accounts that can be opened for any child, so study up to determine which plans make the most sense for you. But remember: each state’s rules are different so – like your kids – you’ll want to do your homework.</p>\n<p>Then, as with all smart savings plans, contribute on a regular basis over time, through market ups and downs, to benefit from dollar cost averaging and watch your interest compound – and your child’s educational opportunities grow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>For how the new tax law affects the &#8220;Kiddie Tax&#8221; for Uniform Gifts and Transfers to Minors (UGMAs and UTMAs) <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/kiddie-tax-education/\">please click here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>At Sherman Wealth Management we’re passionate about children’s education so please give us a call if you have any questions about your state’s 529 options.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article initially appeared on <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/changes-529-plans-offer-tax-advantages/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\"/>\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.77,"src":"/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/cad89/Age-based-1.png","srcSet":"/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/1d716/Age-based-1.png 100w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/f0031/Age-based-1.png 200w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/cad89/Age-based-1.png 400w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/d4196/Age-based-1.png 600w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/3995d/Age-based-1.png 800w,\n/static/f47c53537ce3886154080cfda1fb9cd2/649fb/Age-based-1.png 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c574f867-a6eb-50d6-a711-bbf17a8395e2","slug":"kiddie-tax-education","title":"The &#8220;Kiddie Tax&#8221; is Changing: What You Need to Know Now","content":"<p>Saving on taxes, while saving for your child or grandchild’s college education, just got a little trickier thanks to important changes in the “Kiddie Tax”.</p>\n<p>The tax bill that was signed into law in December made some significant changes to how Uniform Gifts to Minors Accounts (UGMAs) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Accounts (UTMAs) are taxed.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is the “Kiddie Tax”?</strong></h3>\n<p>“The “Kiddie Tax” was first established in 1986 to keep parents from shielding income by placing investment accounts in the names of their children, who typically are in lower income tax brackets,” explains CPA Joshua Harris of <a href=\"http://www.santospostal.com/\">Santos, Postal &amp; Company</a>. “The initial Kiddie Tax rules expired when a child turned 14. In 2008, this threshold increased to cover children through age 18 and full time students through age 23.”</p>\n<h3><strong>How were Uniform Gifts and Transfers Taxed?</strong></h3>\n<p>UGMAs and UTMAs have been a popular way to save money in a child&#8217;s or grandchild’s name precisely because of their significant tax advantages. A portion of the money earned &#8211; the first $1,050 of the child’s investment income (including interest, dividends and capital gains distributions) has been tax-free; the next $1,050 has taxed at the child’s rate; and investment income above $2,100 was taxed at the parent’s or grandparent’s “marginal” tax rate, ie the highest rate applied to the last dollar earned.</p>\n<h3><strong>How is it Changing?</strong></h3>\n<p>The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made an important change to this graduated “Kiddie Tax.”</p>\n<p>Instead of a child’s investment income above $2,100 being taxed at the parent or grandparent’s individual tax rate, it will be taxed at the 2018 trust and estate tax rates:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 269px;\" width=\"831\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Investment Income</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Trust &amp; Estate Tax Rate</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Up to $2,550</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$2,551-$9,150</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$9,151-$12,500</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Over $12,500</td>\n<td>37%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>Will You Pay More or Less?</strong></h3>\n<p>How much you will pay depends on the amount of investment income and your own marginal tax bracket. As a rule of thumb, the more you have the more you may be taxed this year.</p>\n<p>While the Tax Code changed with this law, it unfortunately did not get simpler. And one alternative, if your rates are going up, may be to consider rolling the UTMA or UGMA into a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/saving-for-college-529-plans/\">529 plan</a>.

The last 18 months of smooth sailing without market volatility got many investors lulled into thinking that that trend would continue indefinitely.</p>\n<p>The result is that a dramatic shift has occurred in investor emotions in just a month, as shown in this chart from CNN Money:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-15-at-4.45.11-PM-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4142\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-15-at-4.45.11-PM-1-300x154.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-15-at-4.45.11-PM-1-300x154.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-15-at-4.45.11-PM-1-1024x526.png 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-15-at-4.45.11-PM-1-768x395.png 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-15-at-4.45.11-PM-1.png 1097w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>We all know that markets experience volatility and, until 18 months ago, it was considered reasonably normal, but no one likes the thought of taking a loss. It’s hard not to panic if your oldest child is in college and her 529 just took a hit or if you’re a year away from retirement and your IRA just lost 15% of it’s paper value.</p>\n<p>Although you no doubt know that impulsive trading is one of the least efficient ways to reach your true long-term investment potential, emotions are powerful drivers. In fact, in Robert Shiller&#8217;s book “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsz9d9vjLzY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m16s\">Irrational Exuberance,&#8221;</a> he states that the emotional state of investors “is no doubt one of the most important factors causing the bull market” we just recently experienced.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows that investor sentiment dropped 30% in the beginning of the year, suggesting that investors’ overall attitude may have been veering from bullish to bearish, although it did bounce back this week.  What it also suggests is that Recency Bias caused investors’ to react more strongly to typical market volatility because it was a-typical during the long period of calm we just experienced.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-4143 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-300x134.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-300x134.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1-768x343.png 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bull-bear-1.png 1002w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The key in times of volatility is to keep your eye on your long-term goals rather than reacting impulsively to temporary trends. In <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/learn-loss.asp#ixzz56deq33Dq\">Taking The Sting Out Of Investment Loss</a><u>,</u> Brian Boch advises: “The golden rule is to differentiate between [decisions] based on rational and prudent trading strategies on the one hand and emotionally-based, panicky decisions on the other. The former generally leads to success over time, while the latter tends to lead to failure.”</p>\n<p>Here at Sherman Wealth Management we believe there is productivity and security in planning for the unknown by defining what it is you already <u>do</u> know. Knowing yourself, your emotions, and the risk you are willing to take is the first step. The second is creating a long-term financial plan with a conflict-free, Fiduciary advisor.</p>\n<p>In a recent post, <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2018/02/the-drawbacks-of-behavioral-finance-during-a-market-correction/\"><u>Ben Carlson</u></a> wrote:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The prep time for a market correction or crash comes well before it actually happens by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting realistic expectations.</li>\n<li>Mapping out a course of attack for when losses occur.</li>\n<li>Making decisions ahead of time about what moves (if any) to make and when depending on what happens.</li>\n<li>Deciding on the correct level of risk to be taken.</li>\n<li>Building behaviorally-aware portfolios.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best solution to financial <em>and</em> emotional volatility is to work with a financial planner on a plan that will make you feel comfortable through the market’s natural ups <u>and</u> downs. You may not be able to control outside factors but you can control your reactions by recognizing how bias works and by preparing both emotionally <em>and</em> financially to reach the long-term goals that matter to you.</p>\n<p>And, as always, if you&#8217;d like to review your plan and how your allocations conform to your own risk tolerance and response to volatility, please <a href=\"https://meetme.so/BradSherman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://meetme.so/BradSherman\">let me know</a> and we’ll schedule a call.</p>\n<div><!--[if mso]>\n\t<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" strokecolor=\"#1e3650\" fill=\"t\">\n<v:fill type=\"tile\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif\" color=\"#34cc09\" />\n\t<w:anchorlock/>\n\t<center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</center>\n\t</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https://meetme.so/PortfolioReview\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#34cc09;background-image:url(https://i.imgur.com/0xPEf.gif);border:1px solid #1e3650;border-radius:4px;color:#ffffff;display:inline-block;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;mso-hide:all;\">Book a Free Call with Brad</a></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.77,"src":"/static/68d08b28267ad7f96ea19ee01d74eec8/cad89/recencybias-1.png","srcSet":"/static/68d08b28267ad7f96ea19ee01d74eec8/1d716/recencybias-1.png 100w,\n/static/68d08b28267ad7f96ea19ee01d74eec8/f0031/recencybias-1.png 200w,\n/static/68d08b28267ad7f96ea19ee01d74eec8/cad89/recencybias-1.png 400w,\n/static/68d08b28267ad7f96ea19ee01d74eec8/d4196/recencybias-1.png 600w,\n/static/68d08b28267ad7f96ea19ee01d74eec8/3995d/recencybias-1.png 800w,\n/static/68d08b28267ad7f96ea19ee01d74eec8/649fb/recencybias-1.png 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"392f1771-e616-5fe9-95ed-6511f7f4aff6","slug":"end-low-volatility","title":"The End of Low Volatility?","content":"<p>Whether you view Friday&#8217;s stock market sell-off as an adjustment to permit the markets to climb higher on a more solid base, or were nervous about the sharp short term “loss” of unrealized gains, it’s clear that the stock market’s meteoric, historically-long winning streak hit a bump in the road this week.</p>\n<p>Draw downs and sell-offs are normal, but they are still painful when they occur. The market calls it a “correction” but, to the individual investor seeing their net worth drop, it never feels “correct,” particularly since it’s impossible to accurately predict when the volatility and the draw down in prices will end.</p>\n<p>It’s hard for anyone to really anticipate what their own risk tolerance will be until it’s put to the test. In moments of calm, we all want to think we’ll have the presence of mind to remember that the market is cyclical and that downturns and corrections are often an opportunity. Things might look a little different though, if your child’s 529 plan funds just shrank, or if you’re nearing retirement and are counting on an IRA and a 401K, or if you were just about to take some earnings to finance an important project.</p>\n<p>Notice how you felt on Monday as the market dropped again: it’s a good insight into your current risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>Market values have increased dramatically in the last few years and in 2017 in particular. This current market volatility comes after the longest period in history without a correction and with remarkably <em>low</em> volatility. As a result, Friday’s sell off and Monday’s drop may have been a bit of a shock, even though a 5% drop was not unusual as recently as 2016. That makes it particularly difficult to anticipate what will happen next, in the direct short term, since investors may react unpredictably, including too many people who are driven by how they guess <em>others</em> will react.</p>\n<p>There are two important things to remember when the market is volatile. The first is that volatility and risk are not the same thing: volatility is a normal variation in value, risk is the possibility that an investment will fail. The second is that it&#8217;s important to look at trends over time, not just yesterday&#8217;s news.

It may sound like a foreign concept to some, but for many simply having their own emotions attached to their personal finances, make it too close for comfort. They say anytime emotions are involved logic can go out the window. Let us help remind you of the logic of needs vs. wants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is a need? Human basic needs are as simple as food, water, and shelter, therefore, your monthly mortgage or rent payment, monthly food and beverage expenses, and we can also add transportation i.e. car payment, insurance, and gas all go into this category. What may seem shocking to some is that everything else is a want. In the complicated consumer driven world we live in it may be hard to fathom, but if it isn’t necessary for your survival it is a desire, not a necessity. And furthermore, if it’s a materialistic good rather than an intangible experience, experts say you probably won’t even miss it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ok now that we’ve defined a want and a need, lets practice an exercise. According to David Bach, author of “The Automatic Millionaire” “Becoming rich requires nothing more than committing and sticking to a systematic savings and investment plan” <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/self-made-millionaire-got-life-changing-money-advice-at-age-7.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/self-made-millionaire-got-life-changing-money-advice-at-age-7.html</a> Ready to get started now? Take out a piece of paper and pen. Create two categories; wants and needs. Start listing everything you spend money on in a month. Determine whether it is a want or need. Create another list. Write your future goals. Picture yourself taking the vacation you’ve dreamed of for years, or retiring early. Whatever your goals are, visualize yourself completing them. Now return to your list of wants and needs. How can you “trim the fat” on your daily spending habits so you really can save more for the things that will fulfill you later. For example : One easy fat trimmer is to shop around for things you already are paying for. Items such as your cell phone, cable, internet, and insurance can easily be shopped around for a lower price. Visualizing yourself completing your long term goals can help motivate you to sacrifice temporary gratification for something that may lead to a happier you in the long run. Now you can put more towards your retirement, so you can vacation permanently, sooner!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, what tools will you need to implement to further achieve your goals? Personally, my wife and I are big fans of technology that track our spending, keep us honest and transparent by categorizing each purchase through linking our credit card spending and automatically deducting the budget category the purchase must be subtracted from. Theres nothing to hide when you make a budget, add all of your credit cards, and promise to stick to it. We’ve also found that being realistic and making achievable goals ensures we are more successful, but you know what makes us the most successful? Having a financial plan! Sherman Wealth Management uses tools that will link users accounts so we have access to your budget and balances and can help you come up with a financial plan right for you. Also by hiring a fee only fiduciary financial advisor whose emotions aren’t involved in our spending habits we’ve no longer clouded our logic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Still have your reservations? A study at Princeton found that every 10% rise in annual income moves people up the life satisfaction ladder the same amount, whether they’re making $25,000. Or $100,000. “High incomes don’t bring you happiness, but they do bring you a life you think is better.” That being said; What if we all gave ourselves a 10% rise in income by trimming the fat in our expenses and adding the profit to our bottom line further assisting us in accomplishing our goals.  What if we found that we possess the power and control to increase our actual happiness by simply living with less, saving more, and reaching our goals by following through with them? And what if by living with less we are more fulfilled.  Studies have proven that having less and living more simply does lead to greater overall life satisfaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feeling like you could use some help?

Sadly, it’s not just one person’s perspective. It’s a sentiment that is shared by the 40-50% of Americans who believe that winning the lottery is the only way they can get what they need for retirement.</p>\n<p>The odds of winning a Powerball have recently been calculated to be 1 in 292,000,000. As a financial advisor, I am frustrated by an investment strategy that is based on a verifiably unrealistic longshot. That frustration is only compounded by the fact that there is a simple solution! The real winning ticket to ensure you can live comfortably in retirement is not a lottery ticket, but rather a concept you likely have heard of but brushed aside: compound interest.</p>\n<p>It’s Been Said That Albert Einstein Called Compound Interest the Eighth Wonder of the World</p>\n<p>And even if he didn’t, it’s still a brilliant investing tool. Simply put, compounding is a process which generates additional return on an asset’s reinvested earnings. To be effective, it requires two simple things: the reinvestment of earnings, and time. If properly managed, compound interest can help your initial investment grow exponentially. For those of you who enjoy math, here’s the formula:</p>\n<p>Ending $$ = Beginning $$ * (1 + return) ^ total time frame of compounding</p>\n<p>While this is a useful strategy for all investors, for young investors in particular, it is the greatest investing tool for long-term growth, and the #1 argument in support of starting as early as possible. Just look at the graph below, which represents the growth of $100 over 30 years:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can see that without reinvestment, the return potential is significantly reduced no matter what the rate of return is. This is important to understand because many investors are tempted to capitalize on their gains too early. The results reflected in this graph make it clear that choosing to instead reinvest those gains is going to make a significant difference in the long run.</p>\n<p>The best advice for how to implement this strategy and maximize your long-run returns is to (1) postpone gains, and (2) rebalance efficiently. When tempted to take a short-term gain, always ask yourself: do you really need to sell? If not, don’t. Committing to a long-range investment strategy will make a world of difference in your returns. And when rebalancing, instead of creating a tax event by taking gains, consider allocating future proceeds into holdings that have underperformed.</p>\n<p>Compounding interest becomes more complicated when the effect of taxes is factored in. Investors are often not able to reinvest all of the money that has been paid out because the government takes its cut. In order to get around this, you should try to minimize the effects of taxes by putting money into tax efficient accounts; ensuring that tax inefficient assets/strategies are in kept in retirement accounts; allocating assets to tax efficient areas of the market such as municipal bonds and real estate; and utilizing ETFs to delay tax events for stock holdings.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be Einstein to understand the power of compounding interest. Instead of putting your fate in the hands of the lottery, take control of your retirement plan through smart, well-thought-out investment decisions.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign of the Times</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t too long ago that every teenager was fawning over the boy-band One Direction.  Now, only a few years later, the band members are all pursuing their own solo careers.  In his 2017 solo debut album, the former One Direction member Harry Styles sings the hook “Just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times.”  While there are numerous interpretations of what the line is about, when I hear it my mind wanders immediately to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe that makes me a finance nerd, but I connect these two because the world of investing is changing so rapidly, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  It used to be that mutual funds were the be-all and end-all of getting exposure to diversified equity and fixed income returns.  Modern trends, though, show that millennial investors are increasingly enamored by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and are pouring more money in these diversified low-cost, passively managed index funds than ever before.  A recent </span><a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-millennials-love-etfs-2016-09-21?mg=prod/accounts-mw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that 66% of millennials say they expect to boost their holdings of ETFs over the next year, up from 61% in last year’s survey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see a similar growth trend in the chart below.  We can see that while asset levels for actively managed mutual funds are still eight times higher than ETF asset levels, there is a staggering difference in their annualized growth rates.  While mutual funds are barely growing at .8%, ETF assets are growing at a pace of 21.4%.  </span></p>\n<p><a

400;\">The conclusion is clear: ETFs took in more than three times the net inflows in the first half of 2017 because </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the world is changing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Millennials are seeking out the funds as an alternative to traditional mutual funds in response to the changing environment around them, the preference for low-fees, and the flexibility of being able to trade in and out of the funds as frequently and as quickly as they desire.  The faster that advisors start to recognize and adapt to that changing world, the better they are able to meet the needs and desires of their clients.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we understand that our clients are seeking low-cost, diversified portfolios and as a fiduciary, we feel it is our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities posed by ETFs.  We were one of the early adopters of these diversified funds because we saw the value of having a low-cost, tax-efficient portfolio that, if done wisely, can be combined to meet target allocations that have diversification benefits creating worthwhile risk-adjusted returns.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see ETFs as an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">opportunity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of competition.  Instead of individual stock picking, ETFs give us the ability to spend our time focusing on a top-down approach to asset allocation.  This means assessing where the opportunities lie within different asset classes and combining attractive ETFs in these</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> high-probability sandboxes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a way that we feel will maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Instead of the cookie-cutter allocation achieved by working with robo-advisors, we have real people putting together your portfolio and looking under the hood of these funds to ensure that they are the best pick for you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we want to be ahead of the times &#8211; not stuck lamenting the past.  </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So… just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times.  </span></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:

Orrin Hatch, Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady) might not have learned as much as they could have from the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which arguably was defeated due to a lack of clear details and shortage of bipartisan support.  In a repeat tactic, the push for passing the bill under “budget reconciliation” would require only a simple majority in the Senate to pass the law.  But it should be noted that this can only happen if projections show that the total revenue differential over the next 10 years is $1.5 trillion or less.  Right now, </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2017/09/27/release-of-gops-long-awaited-tax-plan-reveals-exactly-why-tax-reform-is-so-hard/#35ce89314597\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projections</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> place it at $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.  That means the GOP will either need bipartisan Senate support with 60 votes or find $1 million in reduced projections.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the highlights of the proposed plan and how they could impact your personal income taxes if they should be passed:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fewer Tax Brackets</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Instead of the seven tax brackets we face today ranging from 10% to 39.6%, the new plan proposes only three: 12%, 25%, and 35%.  Because the plan does not specify where these cut-offs will be, though, we can only speculate on how these will impact individuals positively or negatively.  If speculation is correct, those currently facing 28% and 33% tax rates would see a tax cut to the new 25% rate, which would be beneficial.  The idea of adding a fourth bracket for the wealthiest Americans has also been floated.\n<p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Doubles the Standard Deduction, but Eliminates Personal Exemptions <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; The marketing tactic for the bill is that it is a huge break to middle-class Americans by doubling the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for single filers and from $12,000 to $24,000 for joint filers.\n<p></span></b><b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a catch, though</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  These increases are being offset by the elimination of personal exemptions. The result is what seems like a 50% increase to most taxpayers, in reality, is closer to 15%.</p>\n<p></span></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Reduction of Elimination of Itemized Deductions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; If in the past you have chosen to itemize your deductions, you could be getting the short end of the stick here.  The plan calls for reductions or elimination of many itemized deductions, without providing specifics on which ones.  It has only been stated that they will keep the deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions.  It also mentions benefits that encourage work, higher education and retirement savings, but provides no details on these.\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The largest red flag for many is concerning the elimination of state and local tax deductions.  Currently, you can deduct what you pay in state and local taxes from your federal income bill.  If this is eliminated, it could disproportionately affect those who live in high-tax states such as Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California, and Maryland.  Only two days after the plan was released, objections from Blue-state Republicans have caused them to reconsider eliminating these deductions.<br />\n</span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\nAdditionally, homeowners or anyone paying real estate taxes will see that their property taxes are no longer deductible under the new plan.  Again, this will have a disproportionately large impact for those living in states with high real estate taxes.<br />\n</span></b>Below is a breakdown of what the new and old tax brackets could look like for single filers:<i><span><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4073 aligncenter\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"814\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1.png 1251w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-300x125.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-1024x427.png 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-2.35.45-PM-e1506710781983-1-768x320.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px\" /></a></span></i><i><span>Source</span></i><span>: </span><span><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tax-plan-details-corporate-rate-individual-brackets-deductions-cuts-2017-9?nr_email_referer=1&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=PoliticsSelect&amp;pt=385758&amp;ct=Sailthru_BI_Newsletters&amp;mt=8&amp;utm_campaign=BI%20Politics%202017-09-28&amp;utm_term=Politics%20Select%20-%20Engaged%2C%20Active%2C%20Passive%2C%20Disengaged\">Business Insider</a></p>\n<p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Changes for Families</b><span>&#8211; There may be some significant changes to the tax code surrounding families as well, including single parents and households with two or more children.\n<p></span>Currently, single parents fall into a favorable tax bracket somewhere in between single and married-filing-joint rates as well as a 50% boost to their standard deduction.  The new plan would likely eliminate this, meaning single parents could face higher rates.</p>\n<p>That being said, these cuts could potentially be offset by an unspecified “significant increase” to the Child Tax Credit.  Depending on the size of this Child Tax Credit, households with a two or more children could also see increased rates because of the elimination of the exemption based on the number of children.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Eliminates the Death Tax and Alternative Minimum Tax</b><span> &#8211; The estate (“death”) tax only currently applies to 0.14% of Americans, whose assets exceeded $10.9 million and did not hire a competent estate planner.  So this likely does not affect you, but it would be eliminated under this plan.\n<p></span>The alternative minimum tax forces those who have an outsized number of deductions to pay an alternative tax rate instead.  The truth is, very few people understand it anyway.  This is likely a good thing, especially if the goal is simplicity.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Small Businesses, including ours!<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; In terms of small-business owners, there is a whole separate set of changes to be considered.  For ‘pass-through’ businesses like ours, the plan wants to lower the maximum rate from 39.6% to 25%, which is particularly appealing to making smaller firms more competitive.\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Questions still surround this due, though, to Steve Mnuchin’s </span><a href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/09/12/mnuchin-some-services-companies-wont-get-pass-through-tax-rate-update.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vague statements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding limitations on what types of businesses will get this lowered rate as well as how they will distinguish between personal income and business income.  Additionally, many have pointed out that nine in 10 businesses that pass through their income already pay at the 25% rate or less, meaning this change could be ultimately inconsequential.</p>\n<p></span></b><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For larger corporations, the plan proposes lowering the tax rate from 35% to 20% and a one-time repatriation of overseas assets at an unspecified lower rate.   </span></b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions related to your specific situation, don’t hesitate to contact us </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  We will keep you updated as more developments are made and the plan evolves.  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">***</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.  They are for information purposes only.

 Are you using unreasonable future growth assumptions to accomplish your goals?  If you are honest with yourself and realize you are taking on more risk than you are comfortable with, you should adjust your risk level and financial plan as soon as possible, not as a reactionary measure to a market downturn.  Additionally, regardless of your risk tolerance, everyone should have an emergency fund that is invested conservatively as a fallback.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel that you are taking a level of risk that you are comfortable with, but are still worried about your own panic getting in the way of your plans &#8211; draft a plan now for how you will deal with it.  If you can’t handle seeing the color red, logging into your portfolio every day is probably not recommended. Ask yourself where there is wiggle room in your financial plan.  Prioritizing your goals and figuring out what you would do differently if the need arose is a good way to feel more secure if things are not going well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think making changes to your portfolio is the right move, make sure get a second opinion from someone with a level-head.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we are committed to answering all of your questions, addressing your concerns and helping you to avoid common behavioral mistakes.  When you imagine yourself in a sinking car, rest assured that we are right there to coach you through it.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**</span></i></p>\n<h6><b><i>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

associate </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan McKenna </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote a great piece about his experience being new to the biz that I thought was worth sharing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">___________________________________________________</span></p>\n<h1><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m new here.  </span></i></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best word I can think of for explaining the experience of being a freshly-graduated analyst entering this market is… </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baffling</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Every week I read the news that markets are hitting new all time highs, that we have shaken off the effects of the global financial crisis and that excellent Q2 earnings reports are the catalyst that will push stocks higher.  There is almost a weekly reminder that markets do not die from old age.  Yesterday, the Dow climbed back above 22000 as investor fears retreated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, every week I also read articles from investors screaming that the end is near, markets cannot possibly keep up with their current pace, P/E ratios are outlandish and we need to be paring back risk.  For example, a month ago, the co-founder and chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital LP, Jeffrey Gundlach, </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/gundlach-wary-of-pricey-market-sets-cap-on-doubleline-s-growth\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that risky assets are overvalued and that investors should be “moving toward the exits.”  Since then, markets have pushed even higher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No wonder the average client is looking to their advisor with a look of complete confusion and truthfully, a fair amount of fear.  In times like these, the words of my graduate-school mentor (one of the most brilliant finance professionals I know) often ring in my ears.  He always reminded me of a piece of wisdom I want to share with you: </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody knows anything in this field.</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By that he means… nobody </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">knows</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for certain what is going to happen.  If we truly did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">know</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the future, we’d never have to work again.  We could all leverage up, pick the winners, and make so much money our eyes would glaze over.  But we </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> know the future.  That’s why we spend so much time crafting diversified portfolios and picking the right amount of risk for each individual’s unique tolerance.  Face it: you’re probably not going to achieve your daydream of being the protagonist of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Short </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who calls the financial crisis before it happens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have to understand that the difference of opinion is what makes a market exist.  Don’t forget that there is an incremental seller for each and every buyer in the market.  Right when you’re convinced to buy a security, someone else is convinced to sell.  That is just how it works.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplest thing to do is to remain calm and stick to your plan.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we use broad-based financial planning that is designed around your unique risk tolerance and your goals.  Unless it directly affects your financial plan, ignore the noise in the markets and that nagging voice in the back of your mind that screams sell every time you read a negative piece of news.  </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I might be new here, but I can predict the future just as well as the next guy.

Journal </span><a href=\"http://on.wsj.com/2ePYDpa\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that hackers had gained access to some of the systems of Equifax Inc., one of the largest three credit reporting companies, potentially compromising the personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers.  The systems they gained access to contained customers’ names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and addresses.  These four pieces of information are generally needed for consumers to apply for many forms of consumer credit, including credit cards and personal loans.  This raises the risk of fraud, as it means the hackers could have an easier time getting approved for credit under someone else’s name.  In addition to this information, credit card numbers, driver&#8217;s licenses, and dispute documents with sensitive information could have been compromised for some users.  Because Equifax gets its data from credit card companies, banks, retailers and lenders,</span><b> you could be affected regardless of whether or not you have ever knowingly provided them information</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is being called one of the largest and most threatening data breaches of recent years.  We encourage everyone to make sure they are protected and to closely monitor their credit for identity theft.  Equifax has set up a </span><a href=\"http://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help consumers determine if their information has been compromised.  One also can call their dedicated call center for consumers at 1-866-447-7559.  The company offers credit-monitoring and identity-theft protection products to guard consumers’ personal information.  Consumers can also protect themselves by immediately placing </span><a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fraud alerts on their credit reports</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  This means that a lender must contact you to verify your identity before it issues credit in your name for the next 90 days.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions, don’t

move into a new home, which needless to say, has been a chaotic process.  It really got me thinking, though, about real estate/home ownership and how it fits into client portfolios and their financial plans.</p>\n<h2>The mantra of the middle class is <em>buy a home</em>.  But is it always the best decision for your money?</h2>\n<p>Buying residential real estate certainly poses some undeniable advantages.  For many people, there is a certain pride in homeownership.  After all, it is the epitome of the American Dream.  Additionally, the interest and property tax portion of your mortgage is tax-deductible, and not unimportantly, homes tend to increase in value, build equity and provide a nest egg for the future.</p>\n<p>But what is very often overlooked by the average American is the opportunity cost of their money and how their mortgages play a role in that.  A recent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/is-money-in-the-bank-always-the-smarter-bet-1503662401\">Wall Street Journal article</a> highlights the important decision individuals face when they have excess cash.  It recommends taking a close look at what interest rates you pay on a mortgage and how those compare to the savings amount on your bank account as well as the rate of return on investments in equity and bonds.</p>\n<p>When homeowners do this, they often are struck with a revelation: they are likely not getting as high of a return on their investment as they would have if they were invested more heavily in equity.  Ultimately, the opportunity cost of having your money tied up in your mortgage could actually hurt your long-term wealth.  Even worse, the tax breaks you are receiving do not cover the amount of loss incurred from your interest rate!  A recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-28/how-the-top-1-keeps-getting-richer\">Bloomberg article</a> went so far to say that this simple understanding is one of the distinctions that separates the world’s wealthiest individuals from the middle class and one of the major contributing factors to income inequality.  Basically, it argues that a major difference between the middle class and the top 1% is that the middle class have too much of their portfolios tied in up residential real estate that is not providing adequate returns.</p>\n<p>There is a theory out there that wealthy individuals are simply more skilled investors.  A <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2706207\">recent study</a> explains that this is not true. (In fact, they might be worse!)  Wealthy people just tend to own most of the equity in the economy, meaning that when business does well, they reap disproportionately large benefits.  Generally speaking, rich individuals own the upside of the economy in the form of stock, while the middle class’s gains are limited by the slow growth of housing wealth.  It is no surprise that the collapse of the housing bubble has exacerbated wealth inequality because stocks recovered more strongly than real estate did.  Maybe the difference between you and the 1% is just your perception of the options available to you.</p>\n<p>Surely, shelter is one of the basic necessities of life.  Everyone has to live somewhere &#8211; but taking the time to consider all of your options before making any large financial decisions is something that every person should do.  At the very least, you should consider the opportunity costs of your cash and look into advantages of a less expensive housing option, renting, or investing more in equity to ensure that you are getting the most out of your money in the long run.</p>\n<h2>At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe that real life decisions call for real life financial planning.</h2>\n<p>These are the kinds of decisions we want to help you make, so don’t hesitate to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">contact us</a> today to get started.</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

That strikes us as a conflict that is unmanageable and ultimately, comes at the cost of the client.</p>\n<p>In the fallout of the financial crisis, regulators have tried to step in over the last decade to ensure that the world of retirement advice acts without conflicts of interest, specifically by holding all financial advisors to a status of “fiduciary.”  It means that these advisors who have potential conflicts of interest will have to increase their disclosures and explain what they do for clients as it relates to advice on retirement assets.  These advisors are upset!  While they might not admit it, they are concerned that this new rule will affect their income.  The increased pressure these advisors are putting on the administration has resulted in the <a href=\"https://t.co/aOnA0Rwdda\">Labor Department seeking an 18-month delay in its implementation</a>.  While the rule is designed to protect the retirement savings of clients, the pushback could ultimately cause the rule to never get implemented.</p>\n<p>So again, where do you as a client fall in this equation?  Just how valuable is your “trusted” relationship?</p>\n<p>That is where we come in.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we have always been a fee-only fiduciary.  That means while competitors are off arguing about fees, disclosures and conflicts of interest, we already subscribe to the status of “fiduciary” and will remain unaffected by the changes.  We provide uncompromised advice and our compensation is not based on commissions or any salesmanship of a product.  The only thing we are “selling” is our best customized advice for your unique financial situation.  We believe that working with an advisor who is already committed to functioning in your best interest will give you peace of mind about your retirement savings.</p>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">reach out</a> to us anytime with questions or comments.  Unlike Matilda’s Mrs. Trunchbull, you won’t have to hunt us down.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

underestimate the adjective.</h3>\n<p>In today’s world, the rise of “robo advisors” have led some to (incorrectly) conclude that managing investment portfolios is simple.  As far as they are concerned, as long as you have a software program, you’re set.  Within minutes, a computer system can analyze your risk tolerance, determine the best investments for your unique situation and be setup to adjust it every three months if it falls out of line.  These programs provide low cost access to data-driven algorithms for trading.  We’ve discussed some of the pros and cons in our recent <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<h3>But there is something missing if that is where the finance conversation stopped.</h3>\n<p>A glance at the <a href=\"https://www.behaviorgap.com/\">Behavior Gap</a> chart below points out the simple but incredibly valuable missing link: your lifetime returns are driven much more substantially by your own behavior than by the portfolio you have set up.  This is where the financial advisor steps in, because managing <em><u>you</u></em> and crafting plans around your individual needs, behaviors, and ideas is something a computer program cannot do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/behavior-gap-1.jpg\"><img

behavioral finance seeks to identify common biases that humans make when investing, including but not limited to: herd mentality, loss aversion, confirmation bias, availability bias, the disposition effect, familiarity bias and self attribution bias.  These are just some of the many important behavioral issues that the human connection you have with an advisor can help you avoid.</p>\n<p>A computer program cannot tell you that you are overreacting to a report you read on the news, or explain that chasing returns is likely not going to provide a benefit.  A computer program can’t coach you through identifying personal goals or customize budgets that will grow and change as unexpected life events pop-up.  A computer program isn’t going to give you a call when they see a red-flag in your budget or spending habits.  A computer program can’t push you to think beyond a limited scope to identify all of your goals and priorities or be there to answer the phone when you have a question.  For example: Do you want to send your kids to private school?  Do you want to be there to support your parents as they age?</p>\n<p>Don’t get us wrong: that hardly means you should shun technology.  At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe that a good financial advisor knows how to take the power that technology has to offer and add in all of the benefits that only a personal human connection can provide.  We believe that a good financial advisor is someone that you know and trust, who takes your financial plan as seriously as they would their own.  Here, we utilize a user-tech interface that allows our clients to manage all of the pieces of their financial plan, from cash flow to 401Ks, while allowing an experienced advisor to monitor it for new opportunities and to ensure clients are on the path to meet their goals.  That means you get access to all of their knowledge and expertise in combination with the power of technology to enhance returns, increase efficiency and provide you with flexibility and control.   As a fee-only fiduciary, we take that responsibility very seriously, and that includes taking advantage of all of the tools at our disposal.</p>\n<p>Do you feel that you are getting what you need out of your advisory relationship?  If not, we encourage you to reach out to us at anytime <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/contact-financial-advisor-in-maryland/\">here</a>. Sherman Wealth Management’s approach is based on the understanding that personal finance should be just that&#8230; <em><u>personal</u></em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Unconscious biases that can wreck havoc with financial well being include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The tendency for investors to react more strongly to negative news than to positive news</li>\n<li>Placing more weight – positive or negative &#8211; on current news than on the big picture</li>\n<li>A “herd mentality” that leads investors to follow the crowd, buying securities at their peak prices as a result</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What’s the first step in achieving financial well being?</h2>\n<p>A good first step towards achieving financial well being is becoming aware of the role that our emotions and biases may be playing in our financial decisions, choices, and habits. Think about your financial choices and some of the last few big financial decisions you made: were there emotions involved, however subtly, that may have influence your choices? A good Financial Advisor, particularly one well versed in Behavioral Finance, can be enormously helpful. “By identifying specific patterns of thought that may sabotage a client’s overall financial health,’” writes Sarah Newcomb, Ph.D., a behavioral scientist for Morningstar, “an advisor can help guide clients into making better financial decisions and increase their satisfaction and peace of mind.”</p>\n<p>An added benefit of identifying some of the emotions or biases that may be driving financial decisions: some of my clients have told me that discovering a bias that has affected their financial decisions has lead them to understand other ways that same bias has been affecting their life as well!</p>\n<p>Nothing beats a sense of well being, and feeling more secure financially definitely contributes to a greater overall sense of well being and peace of mind. And emotional wellbeing – along with a good financial advisor &#8211; can keep you from sabotaging your own progress, and put you back in control and on your way to achieving your financial goals.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

According to a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/podcasts/how-much-do-you-really-pay-your-financial-adviser/D6E453D8-C530-4029-B99B-7821F499F3B2.html\">recent podcast</a> from the Wall Street Journal, it’s not only <em>how much</em> you pay – but also what you are paying <em>for</em> – that’s a source of communication breakdown between those clients and their advisors.</p>\n<p>While the Department of Labor is pushing to get advisors and brokers to make it easier for clients to understand their fee structures, so far it doesn’t look like many of the bigger firms are taking them up on it.</p>\n<p>Since any firm or advisor can <em>claim</em> to be client-driven, transparent, and “fee-based,” how can you be completely sure about what you’re getting and how much you’re paying? If your advisor is fee-based, rather than strictly fee-only, they may be earning commissions when they recommend certain investment products. Obviously, that creates a potential conflict of interest: those advisors have incentives to trade more frequently, and to recommend specific products in order to generate higher commissions for themselves and their firm, whether or not they’re best for you.</p>\n<p>One way to avoid uncertainty – and the potential headaches it brings – is to work with a <em>fee-only</em> registered investment advisory firm (RIA). Fee-only RIAs and advisors do not earn commissions so they are <em>not</em> motivated by the frequency of trades, so they are less likely to encourage buying and selling unless it’s the best choice for you. Because RIAs are held to a fiduciary standard, they are legally bound to always – and only &#8211; act in your best interest.</p>\n<h2>Do your advisor&#8217;s feed include additional services?</h2>\n<p>Even if you are working with a fee-only RIA, however, you may be still not getting your full money’s worth. Many clients neglect to take advantage of untapped services that are included in their advisor’s fees, such as tax and estate planning, insurance advice, and financial coaching, among other services. If you’re not sure what additional services your advisor – or the advisors you are considering – provide, ask them. It’s the best way to ensure that there’s an open path of communication and that you are getting the most value out of your wealth management experience.</p>\n<p>Only you can decide what kind of fee structure is best for you, what you feel is the appropriate amount to spend on investment management and financial planning, and what additional services are important to you to help you grow your wealth.</p>\n<p>If you’re concerned you’re not getting your money’s worth, though, or that you’re paying too much, here are some good questions to ask yourself: How adequately served do you think you are? Are you confused with what services you are getting and what you are paying for? Do you feel valued? Are your goals being met and are you being listened to?</p>\n<p>If you’re not satisfied with the answers to any of these questions, remember that you have options. Sherman Wealth Management is proud to be a fee-only independent RIA firm, because we feel it is the best way to meet our ethical standards and guarantee that all potential clients have a simple and cost-effective way to access investment management and financial planning.</p>\n<p>Knowing what those options are, and getting clarity in your fee structures – whatever kind of advisor you ultimately choose &#8211; will allow you to feel more confident about the decisions you make, now and for your future.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/are-you-getting-you-moneys-worth-financial-advice/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Sound like a hard idea to sell to kids in vacation mode? Not if you make it a rewarding part of summer fun. Here are some tips to incorporate smart money lessons for kids from K-12 that will add to their summer fun and set a great foundation for making smart money choices later on.</p>\n<h3>SAVING</h3>\n<p>Ask your kids to set aside part their allowance for a special summer savings goal then sweeten the pot by telling them you’ll match whatever they save. For the little ones it could be as simple as setting up 2 jars, one for their summer goal (like a super-soaker, hula hoop, or the ingredients for s’mores) and one for the rest of their allowance. They’ll love seeing the jars fill up with coins and counting and re-counting their money. For older kids who are saving for a concert ticket or a tattoo (just kidding!), an app or a website that keeps track of their savings and your matching funds is a great way of getting them interested.</p>\n<h3>EARNING</h3>\n<p>Nothing like learning the satisfaction of having your “own” money! Even if your older children have an actual summer job, consider “hiring” them for extra chores like organizing your photo files, digitizing old cassettes and CDs, or washing the windows. For the little ones, watering plants, pulling up 20 weeds (counting skills!) or helping you rinse the car can help add their allowance jars.</p>\n<h3>INVESTING</h3>\n<p>There are fun games to teach kids of all ages about the stock market, investing, and the power of compound interest (like <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media/game-0007-invest-quest\">InvestQuest</a> from the FTC.) The best way of course, though, is to follow the real stock market. Why not have every family member invest a virtual $1000 in 2 companies whose products they know at the beginning of the summer (Lego and Disney for the younger kids, for instance) and see who ends up with the most virtual profit by the end of the summer. Or, if you have the resources, open accounts for the kids with real investments, however small, so they can watch them go up and down, while earning interest, over the months and years ahead. The SEC&#8217;s site <a href=\"https://investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator\">Investor.gov</a> has a great compound interest generator to show kids how their money could grow.</p>\n<h3>SPENDING</h3>\n<p>Summer is also a great time to teach kids about comparison shopping, supply and demand, and the power of buying things when they are on sale. Keeping track of what you save each time you buy a sale-priced item this summer can be an eye-opening for your kids. As you enjoy vacation trips, or even day trips to waterparks, let your kids know about the <em>value</em> you are getting (rather than complaining about high prices.) Give the kids a choice when possible, telling them how much you have to spend for the day and ask their input about how to spend it. When they know that buying cotton candy means they are giving up two rides they learn a valuable lesson about resource allocation!</p>\n<h3>READING</h3>\n<p>Find great books to read or listen to in the car about entrepreneurs’ success stories. Young children will enjoy books about Thomas Edison, for instance, or Alexander Who Used to Be Rich Last Sunday. Try a biography of Steve Jobs for the teens, or check out finance videos from Khan Academy.</p>\n<h3>PAYING</h3>\n<p>Take a moment to explain what you’re paying for when you’re paying bills: show your kids how the electric bills soar in the summer if you’re use air conditioning or your water bill if you’re watering the lawn. Calculate – or Google &#8211; how much it costs when they leave lights on. Not exactly entertaining but an empowering eye-opener for kids.</p>\n<h3>PLAYING</h3>\n<p>Nothing like a great game of Monopoly to while away summer nights while teaching kids about saving up for those houses and hotels (including our favorite trick: hiding money under the board so no one sees how much you are accumulating!)</p>\n<p>In short, if you treat money matter-of-factly &#8211; and build in some challenges, competition, and entertainment &#8211; summer can be a great time to sneak in a little fun “schooling” that will help prepare kids for an empowered future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * * * *</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

For parents of younger children, however, those happy announcements may make them wonder if they are being savvy about starting to save for college.</p>\n<p>One thing any parent will tell you is that time flies. Before you know it, your toddler will be taking the SATs. And one thing any financial advisor will tell you is that the earlier you start <em>any</em> savings plan, the better off you’ll be (although any time is better than no time.)</p>\n<h2><strong>Not all college savings plans are created equal</strong></h2>\n<p>The good news is that more parents than ever are already saving, including an impressive 65% of young millennial parents, according to Sallie Mae’s 2016 report <em>How America Saves for College</em>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, 61% of the parents surveyed said they are putting their savings in regular savings accounts, and a whopping 44% of all money saved is held in savings &amp; checking accounts, CDs, savings bonds and other low-yielding instruments. And too many of the non-savers are hoping that earnings from their own investments or savings will cover college.</p>\n<p>So what are the best ways to save for your child’s education?</p>\n<h2><strong>Better Ways to Save &#8211; 529s, ESAs, and UTMAs</strong></h2>\n<p>With the availability of excellent plans with significant tax benefits and the potential for compound interest gains, why are so few parents taking advantage of them? One reason may be that the various plans, while excellent, are not always easy to understand. Even the alphabet soup of names is daunting when you’re also worried about packing lunches, soccer practice, and missing work for parent teacher conferences.</p>\n<p>Here’s a simplified look at the top plans:</p>\n<h2><strong>529 Plans</strong></h2>\n<p>While 529 plans have been around since 1996, they still seem to be a well-kept secret, with only 22% of college savings invested in these portfolios of investment funds (here too, savvy Millennials are leading the charge with 44% planning to take advantage of 529 plans, while Gen X and Baby Boomer parents trail at 36% and 23%.)</p>\n<p>529 plans are offered by each of the 50 states and allow you deposit post-tax money that grows and compounds tax-free. While you can invest in any state’s plan, investing in your own state’s plan may offer state income tax deductions in addition to the federal tax break for earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Anyone can create a 529 account (including the future student) and anyone can add up to $14,000 per year to the account (or $28,000 if married) without paying a federal gift tax. Up to a total of $400,000 can be invested in a 529 plan account per beneficiary (each state sets its own limits) and for most plans there is no age restriction for the beneficiary. <span id=\"UXUtVblr\" class=\"zgmOJOUauG\">They also allow withdrawals to pay for educational supplies such as computers and books, and the account owner can change the beneficiary to another eligible family member if the funds aren’t used.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks</strong>: when you invest in a state plan, you do not control the financial decisions. Instead, you invest in the portfolio of funds offered by the plan. So shop around for the state plan you feel most comfortable with and that best matches your risk tolerance (a good Fiduciary Financial Advisor can help you evaluate the choices.)</p>\n<h2><strong>Coverdell Educational Savings Accounts (ESAs)</strong></h2>\n<p>ESA accounts are similar to a 529 plan in that you contribute post-tax money then growth in value is tax-free. Unlike 529 plans, however, you are free to invest the money as you please.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> You control the investments in the account and, like 529 plans, can use the funds to pay for educational supplies such as computers and books. You can also use ESA funds to pay for K-12 costs if your child goes to a private school. Any funds not used, may be rolled, tax-free, into the ESA of another family member.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks:</strong> Contributions are capped at $2000 per year per beneficiary and must come from contributors whose adjusted gross income for that year is less than $110,000 (or $220,000 for individuals filing joint returns) so this option is not available to higher income contributors. The beneficiary must be under 18 when it the ESA is created and funded, and the funds must be used by age 30 or be subject to federal tax and a 10% penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong>UGMA/UTMA Custodial Accounts</strong></h2>\n<p>The UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Act) and UTMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) allow larger gifts to be made to minors, while still qualifying for gift tax exclusion. They allow a parent or grandparent to reduce their estate for tax purposes with greater flexibility in how the money is invested than a 529 offers.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Custodial accounts have the greatest flexibility. You can contribute as much as you want, invest it as you please, and &#8211; while 529 accounts and ESAs are exclusively intended for education expenses &#8211; funds in a custodial accounts can be used for any purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks:</strong> Unlike 529 plans and ESAs, the earnings are not tax-free. And, while custodian controls how the funds are used while the student is a minor, after the student turns 21 (or 18 in some states,) control is transferred to the student. Another important consideration for both taxes and financial aid applications is that custodial accounts are considered the child’s assets and the income they produce (over $1,050 and up to $2,100) will be taxed as income to the child, then any earnings beyond that are taxed at your rate.</p>\n<h2><strong>Prepaid tuition plans</strong></h2>\n<p>If you live in a state with excellent state schools, prepaid tuition plans may be a smart solution for you. Administered by the individual states, these investment accounts allow you to pay for – or contribute to &#8211; your child&#8217;s future state school tuition at today&#8217;s rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Paying now is a great hedge against rising college costs and the increase in value is not taxed.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential drawbacks</strong>: The funds can only be used at state schools and do not cover room and board.</p>\n<h2><strong>Get a head start on your child’s financial education too</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve chose the plan – or combination &#8211; that makes the most sense for you, it’s a smart idea to share your investment plan with your child, as soon as they&#8217;re old enough to understand. If you get them started early understanding the power of planning, saving, and compound interest, they’ll already have an A+ in financial literacy when they get into the college of their dreams.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\"><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/advisors/54337/brad-sherman/\">Investopedia</a>.</em></div>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This was clearly good news for investors. Adoption has now been delayed, however, and the future of this consumer protection is not clear.</p>\n<h2>Fiduciary means “Trust”</h2>\n<p>The word “Fiduciary” (from a the Latin word for “something inspiring trust”) describes a category of registered independent investment advisors who – like Sherman Wealth &#8211; are required to act <em>solely</em> and <em>exclusively</em> in the best interest of their clients. Our decisions are not colored by any expectation of additional income from the products we recommend.</p>\n<h2>Don’t all advisors work in their clients best interests?</h2>\n<p>Not necessarily. While it seems obvious that giving you the best advice is what you expect your advisor to do – it’s what you <u>pay</u> them for after all &#8211; broker-dealers are not required to operate as fiduciaries.</p>\n<p>Broker-dealers have only been required to recommend products that are deemed a “suitable” choice for a client, not necessarily the <em>best</em> choice. Broker dealers can therefore recommend investments they receive commissions for selling or that their firm has an interest in, <em>whether or not they are the best choice for you.</em></p>\n<p>Let’s put it this way: as long as their recommendations are <em>in </em>the ballpark, they don’t have to aim for hitting it <em>out of</em> the park for you.</p>\n<h2>The new fiduciary rule should be a win-win, right?</h2>\n<p>Again, not necessarily. The new rule, which was passed under the previous administration, was set to go into effect this week and would have required the widespread adoption of the fiduciary rule for investment accounts and assets.</p>\n<p>That would have given investors greater protection and greater confidence in the advice they are getting from their advisors.</p>\n<p>The DOL has delayed the date of adoption until June 9, however, as the result of an executive order by the new administration. The current administration says it needs time to examine and review it, given, among other things, the Financial Industry’s concerns about costs to them, including the money they are earning on commissions from clients like you.</p>\n<h2>How does this affect your Financial Future?</h2>\n<p>If you are already working with a fiduciary, not at all. You are already covered, for <em>all</em> aspects of your investments, not just retirement funds.</p>\n<p>If you are <em>not</em> already with a fiduciary advisor, even if the new rule is adopted in some form or another, it only applies to retirement investments and potentially not the full spectrum of your investing strategy, so you are still not getting the most transparent, trustworthy advice you can.</p>\n<h2>What should you do to insure you’re getting conflict-free advice?</h2>\n<p>Find out if your investor is a fee-only Fiduciary. Ask them. They are required to tell you. And don’t be fooled by “fee-based.” A true fiduciary does not take commissions and is conflict-of-interest free.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the DOL will act in the best interest of consumers and investors. Even if the future of the new ruling is unclear, you can protect yourself by working with one of the many advisories that has – like Sherman Wealth &#8211; <em>already</em> adopted the Fiduciary Standard for all investment categories.</p>\n<p>At Sherman Wealth we are proud to operate as fee-only fiduciaries, which means that our decisions are based on <em>your</em> goals, <em>your</em> risk tolerance, and <em>your</em> plan. Nothing more and nothing less. We couldn’t imagine bringing anything but our best advice to our clients’ financial futures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********</p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Don’t start to build from the roof down, though: make sure that you’re laying a strong financial foundation.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/8-financial-mistakes-avoid-20s-30s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our last post</a> we talked about 8 Financial Mistakes to Avoid in Your 20s and 30s. Here are five more money mistakes to watch out for:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Going on a Financial Blind Date With Your Significant Other: Not Having the Money Talk First</strong></h4>\n<p>Talking about money isn’t romantic and can be downright uncomfortable. That’s why many couples go into marriage—a financial partnership—without knowing exactly who they are partnering with. Discussing personal finances, debt, goals, spending patterns and how you make financial decisions with your partner before marriage, or soon thereafter, is critical to your short- and long-term financial health. (For related reading, see: Don&#8217;t Let Financial Differences Lead to Divorce.)</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Living la Vida Loca: Splurging on the Wedding or a Baby</strong></h4>\n<p>Important milestones like a wedding, a first child or even your first house are exciting and make precious memories that last a lifetime. But be careful not to let them put you in debt or divert you from a financial plan that allows you to make other great memories down the road. Know what you can afford, get creative within your budget, and make sure you’re investing in your partner’s and children’s future as well. The kids won’t mind—or even remember—that you didn’t buy them that top-of-the-line stroller. What they’ll remember is your smile and their favorite red ball. #Priceless</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Not Buckling Your Seat Belt: Neglecting Insurance</strong></h4>\n<p>It’s tempting to skimp on insurance once you’ve covered your basic health and homeowner’s policies, but that’s a big mistake many young adults make. Insurance is an uncomfortable topic—and the options can be very confusing—so covering yourself with health, life, car, home, disability and long-term disability insurance often gets put on the back burner. Cover yourself adequately now so that when the unexpected happens, it’s not a financial disaster. (For related reading, see: Introduction to Insurance.)</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Going for the Gold: Taking a Job for the Pay</strong></h4>\n<p>While a great offer is always tempting, make sure that any job you take is something that will advance you in the direction you want to go. Don&#8217;t take a job just because the money is great, although that’s important too. If you do, you could get stuck in a job you don’t love with nowhere to go. Take a job that is going to move you closer to the job you want—and the even-higher salary you want—in a couple of years.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Putting Too Many Eggs in the Wrong Basket: Not Prioritizing Savings</strong></h4>\n<p>Maxing out your 401(k) or IRA is smart, but don’t forget to save for other major purchases that may be coming up sooner than you think, like buying a new home, having children, or continuing your education. Multiple savings accounts can be a great way to keep your eye on multiple baskets! Be careful, too, not to prioritize your children’s education over saving for your own retirement. Student loans are less expensive than the kind of loans your kids would have to take out to support you if you haven’t set enough savings aside to support your own retirement.</p>\n<p>Enjoy this special time, living your life to the fullest. If you make sure you&#8217;re also making smart financial choices, you&#8217;ll <em>really</em> enjoy your 20s and 30s, knowing that you&#8217;re building a solid future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You’re starting to build the life you envision for yourself, or perhaps you’re still seeking out new experiences to learn more about yourself and your goals.</p>\n<p>These are years when we expect to learn and grow by exploring jobs and careers, cultural experiences, social experiences and other educational opportunities. But too many of us forget to explore and master one of the most critical parts of building the future we want: financial literacy and financial planning.</p>\n<p>The result is that many people enjoy their 20s and make important life changes in their 30s (or vice versa) without understanding how best to support their career and personal goals with a rock-solid financial plan. You could end up flying high, but forget to build a safety net!</p>\n<p>Here are some key mistakes to avoid as you’re getting started:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. </strong><strong>Letting the Chips Fall Where They May: No Budget</strong></h4>\n<p>A first job—or second, or third—is a great feeling. You’re earning money and it’s yours to spend. And too often, we spend it until it’s gone. While a budget may sound restrictive, it actually gives you more freedom because it keeps you from overspending in areas you don’t care about so you have the money you need for what’s important. <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/120816/3-ways-make-budgeting-success-new-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A budget helps you understand where to splurge</a>—on quality that lasts longer, for instance—and where it’s best to economize, such as buying a used car instead of a new one.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Keeping Too Low of a Profile: No Credit Rating</strong></h4>\n<p>Many people just starting out have low credit ratings, or worse, no credit rating at all (if you’ve always used your parents credit cards, for instance). With a low credit score, your costs will be higher for things like insurance, car financing and mortgage rates. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building good credit now</a>, by getting your own credit card and paying it diligently, or even getting a credit-building loan, will establish a good rating that will help you down the road.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Putting It off Until Tomorrow: Living on Credit Cards</strong></h4>\n<p>Credit cards can be a godsend, particularly the ones with loyalty points. But those points pale in value beside the damage that finance charges can do. Do treat your credit cards like a smart way to keep track of your spending, but don’t spend more than you actually have. Paying credit cards off in full each month not only keeps you within your budget and keeps you from accruing finance charges, it also helps you build a great credit rating for when you do need to borrow money. (For related reading, see: 10 Reasons to Use Your Credit Card.)</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Living on Perks Instead of Salary: Not Paying Yourself First</strong></h4>\n<p>We’ve all been to that job interview where they say that the salary is low but they have a great exercise room, volleyball team and popcorn machine. That popcorn won’t pay the rent and it won’t pay a down payment when you find that great condo. Create a savings plan and pay yourself first before you splurge on lifestyle perks like vacations and expensive shoes. That plan should include saving for short-term goals, saving for an emergency fund, and starting to save for retirement. While retirement may seem a long way off, the earlier you start, the more you harness the power of compound interest. Make sure your budget includes saving and contributing, on a regular basis no matter how small the amount, to an IRA or 401(k) before you start spending.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Living on the Edge: No Emergency Fund</strong></h4>\n<p>While it’s hard to imagine needing emergency funds when you’re young and just starting out, you never know what the future can bring. Crises like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 crash left a lot of people struggling without a safety net, but even something as simple as a pet’s sudden illness can present a huge challenge when you’re on a tight budget. Try to start contributing to an emergency fund that you keep in highly liquid funds for when the unexpected happens. (For related reading, see: Building an Emergency Fund.)</p>\n<h4><strong>6. Playing the Odds: No Health Insurance</strong></h4>\n<p>Many young people who are in peak health think that they can skip—or skimp—on health insurance. While you may indeed be fit and healthy, that doesn’t protect you from potential sports injuries, appendicitis, bouts with the flu or—perish the thought—a car accident. High medical bills are the biggest cause of personal bankruptcy. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/back-basics-insurance-cheat-sheet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get the best coverage you can afford</a>: you’ll be amazed how quickly it pays for itself.</p>\n<h4><strong>7. Going With the Flow: Not Setting Financial Goals</strong></h4>\n<p>“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you’re heading,” goes the famous quote attributed to Lao Tzu. That means it’s a good idea to think about where you’d like to be—in a year, in five years, in 20 years—and make sure that’s the path you’re on. Simple goals like “I want to save $20.00 a week,” or more elaborate ones, like “I’d like to work for myself from a house on the beach,” all begin with awareness and taking the first small steps. <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/100616/dont-let-emotions-hinder-your-investing-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Set a few goals</a>; you can always change them later, but if you don’t, you’re drifting without being mindful of where the currents are taking you.</p>\n<h4><strong>8. Taking Your Eye off the Ball: Using a Non-Fiduciary Advisor or Commission-Based Investment Site</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/age_vs_risk_tolerance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">It’s never too late</a> to become financially literate. The internet is full of great tips (like these) and sites that can help you organize your finances, and it provides access to a range of advisories. Having a financial advisor guide you is an excellent idea but blindly trusting just anyone can be dangerous. Many non-fiduciary advisors are compensated by the financial products they recommend, products that may not be the best ones for you. Make sure the advisor you consult is a fiduciary, i.e. someone who is legally obligated to only recommend options that are in your best interest.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our next post: <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-more-financial-mistakes/\">5 More Financial Mistakes to Avoid</a>.

The increase in the banks’ rate is then passed on to <em>their</em> borrowers, through climbing interest rates on things like credit-card debt, car loans, home equity loans and mortgages.</p>\n<p>This means borrowers may already be feeling a small, but still noteworthy pinch, when it comes to interest on their loans.</p>\n<p>No need to panic though: it doesn&#8217;t need to mean turbulent waters ahead. Taking a look at whether your own financial goals and strategies need to be adjusted will help you stay on track for your own future.</p>\n<h3>How will the hike affect you?</h3>\n<p>The relationship between the economy and interest rates is so complex that even experts sometimes find it daunting. That said, there are a few key action items to consider when interest rates start to rise:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong> 1. Refinancing options for existing loans</strong></p>\n<p>It might be time to consider refinancing to lock into current rates before they begin increasing, including rates on your mortgage, home equity loan, and car loans. Make sure you know which of your loans are adjustable or floating, and discuss with your advisor on what your options are to potentially minimize any increasing costs.</p>\n<p><strong> 2. Your debt payoff strategy and schedule</strong></p>\n<p>Do the math and decide whether it makes sense to reallocate funds and increase your monthly debt payments. By paying more on your loans you reduce the principal quicker and therefore accrue less interest payments over the life of the loan. Your financial advisor may suggest that your investment gains may still offer the potential to offset any interest rate increase however there are many things to consider before making any adjustments (see our risk tolerance point below).</p>\n<p><strong> 3. Bank and credit card balance transfers </strong></p>\n<p>It is always a good idea to shop around for the most favorable credit card and bank rates, particularly if interest rates are about to rise.</p>\n<p><strong> 4. Your risk tolerance</strong></p>\n<p>It is a great time to sit down with your financial advisor and determine whether the level of risk you are comfortable with has changed in light of an expectation of rising interest rates and determine if it is time to rebalance your portfolio or make any adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong> 5. Your budget </strong></p>\n<p>Rising interest rates and a strengthening economy may lead to an increase in the prices for everyday items including gas, groceries, and entertainment. Take a look at your spending and make any adjustments necessary so that you can stay on track with your savings plan.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What’s the good news?</h3>\n<p>By raising rates, the Fed is signaling its confidence that the economy is strengthening, which is great news if you have clearly defined goals and a diversified portfolio.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for these possible benefits:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong> 1. Interest rates on your savings accounts could increase</strong></p>\n<p>While banks tend to raise interest rates on deposits more slowly than on loans, you may see the interest rates applied to your savings accounts increase over time.</p>\n<p><strong> 2. Incentives to buy a home now</strong></p>\n<p>The specter of rising rates could be just the incentive you need to switch from renting to owning your own home.</p>\n<p><strong> 3. Increasing employment rates and salaries</strong></p>\n<p>The Fed has communicated that it believes the economy will continue to improve and that &#8220;labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.&#8221; That is good news because continued growth could mean more jobs and rising wages.</p>\n<p><strong> 4. More business</strong></p>\n<p>A more robust economy may also lead to more consumer confidence , driving more customers, clients, or contracts to your business and this additional business could offset the less desirable attributes of rising rates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Take a look, then take it in stride!</h3>\n<p>March’s rate hike, while small, was an indication that the Federal Reserve is slowly downshifting the stimulus policies it put in place after the financial crisis of 2008. It also indicates confidence that the economy is growing and will continue to grow, at least in the near future.</p>\n<p>Take a look at your savings plan, your investment portfolio, and your risk tolerance with your advisor, and see if you need to make any necessary adjustments.</p>\n<p>With proper diversification, goal-setting, and the help of a Fiduciary financial advisor, you can stay on track to achieving you and your family’s financial goals despite a potentially more costly borrowing environment.</p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

The statistics are alarming, but perhaps not surprising. How we handle money is not usually a topic of that comes up while we are dating. As a result most couples don’t discuss financial compatibility before saying “I do”. When the honeymoon is over, though, and the bills start rolling in, couples often experience a reality check. While love is grand, it can’t pay the bills so it may not take long before fights erupt over different money habits.</p>\n<p>Part of the problem is that it is simply uncomfortable to talk about money. Whether we like it or not, we tend to tie our own feelings of self-worth to money matters. It’s not uncommon to see how much money we make as a direct reflection of how much we are contributing to the relationship. These feelings can become further complicated if there have been financial missteps along the way. While avoiding conversations about money can allow us live in a blissful state of denial for a while, the long-term consequences can be life-altering.</p>\n<p>The good news is that it is never too late to make meaningful changes and save a marriage that is threatened by financial discord.</p>\n<p>According to financial planners who work with couples, money conflicts fall under five main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Differences in spending and saving habits</li>\n<li>Disagreements about who should control the money</li>\n<li>Differences in priorities</li>\n<li>Dishonesty about debt and habits</li>\n<li>Differences in risk profiles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you are experiencing frustration around one of these issues or all five, there are ways to build better financial health as a couple and avoid relationship problems.</p>\n<h2>Effective Communication Leads to Greater Financial Success</h2>\n<p>Effective communication can make a world of difference when it comes to financial matters. Establishing trust, which is cultivated through honest communication, is key. Trust is built when each partner commits to openly expressing their feelings about money and listening to what the other partner has to say. This includes being willing to reveal financial failures, knowing that your partner will be forgiving and withhold judgment.</p>\n<h2>Be Willing to Compromise</h2>\n<p>Although it is easier said than done, another key to resolving money issues is compromise. The first step is for both partners to sit down and agree on a common set of financial goals and what steps they will take to meet those mutual goals. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/3-ways-make-budgeting-success-new-year/\">Establishing a family budget</a> &#8211; and committing to it – is critical. That budget should include some freedom for spending on things that are important to both partners, regardless of who is earning more money.</p>\n<h2>Be Patient</h2>\n<p>As you begin the process of rehabilitating your financial health and establishing clear lines of communication with your partner, remember to be patient. Keep in mind that spending habits are deeply ingrained in each of us. Both you and your partner have been influenced by your parents’ habits and your approach to money has been formed over a lifetime of experiences.</p>\n<h2>Enlist the Help of a Financial Planner</h2>\n<p>Whether you need help mediating tough conversations or you want expert advice on how to establish a budget that will help you meet your financial goals, don’t try to go it alone. Work with a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">financial advisor</a> who can offer helpful insights and steer you in the right direction. With the right help, you can get back on track financially and strengthen your relationship. If you are to the point where money issues are creating such a strain on your marriage that you are considering divorce, outside intervention from an experienced financial advisor can be critically important in finding solutions that work for both of you.</p>\n<h2>Avoid Conflict</h2>\n<p>Often couples will argue about whether they should give or loan money to family members. While each case is different, and very personal, it is generally a good idea to try to avoid making these kinds of loans. Once that first loan is made, you have set a precedent and you are more than likely to receive follow-up request for additional money. While it can be difficult to say no to friends and family, it is always in your financial best interest to avoid these types of transactions.</p>\n<h2>A Happy Ending</h2>\n<p>Even in the best marriages, there are bound to be differences over finances, but those disagreements don’t have to drive a wedge between you and your partner, or worse, lead to divorce. If you actively work to establish trust through open and honest communication and recognize when it is time to seek outside help from a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor, you are taking important steps to letting your financial life be a solid foundation for your marriage – and not the wall between you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">**********</p>\n<h6><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://ow.ly/iMld309YGqU\">Investopedia</a>.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

While most people start families in their 20s or 30s, you might be that 40-year-old who’s just about to adopt a first child. And while most 60-year-olds have hopefully accumulated some retirement savings, you might be that entrepreneurial baby boomer who is moving to Detroit to launch a startup or open a coffee bar.</p>\n<p>In spite of this brave, and exciting, new world of personal choices, what’s the first question a financial advisor or online financial site generally asks you? Chances are it’s your age. Then that answer determines the next question, and the next.</p>\n<p>Too many financial planners and investment sites, unfortunately, use age to make assumptions that then dictate investment recommendations.</p>\n<p>The internet, too, is filled with articles like “Financial Planning Tips Every 30-year-old should know” and “The best financial goals for every age.” There are books and studies that break your life down into age-based phases like “early career phase” and “peak accumulation phase” then make generalization based on those neat buckets.</p>\n<h3><strong>What’s more important than age?</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re all individuals, with different dreams, goals, and life situations and when it comes to financial planning, age is not as important as it used to be.</p>\n<p>Your goals and your risk tolerance should be the factors to consider first in devising a personalized financial plan or investment plan that works for you.</p>\n<p>Is your primary goal buying a house, is it wealth creation for early retirement, is it having income so you can bike around the world for a year? Those answers are more important than the fact that you are 32.</p>\n<p>Does a volatile stock market make you anxious? Do you prefer slow and steady to winner takes all? While it’s generally assumed that young people can afford greater risk and volatility because they have time on their side, you may be that 24 year old that wants or needs to preserve savings first and foremost.</p>\n<p>Goals differ and investment always involves a certain amount of risk. That’s why a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor works with each client individually to manage goals and risk in a way that works for them. It is vital for success to determine the level of risk each client can afford to take, how much risk is necessary to help them achieve their personal goals, and how much risk and volatility they can comfortably live with emotionally.</p>\n<h3><strong>You Are Unique</strong></h3>\n<p>Each of us is unique and that means that no two people will have the exact same goals + risk profile, in spite of being the same age. Yes, living off retirement savings is different than living off a first salary, but the amount may be the same. And paying off student loans is really not all that different from paying off a mortgage.</p>\n<p>What’s important is that you find a good fee-only fiduciary financial advisor who looks beyond pre-programmed, one-size-fits all recommendations for 20-30 year-olds or 60+ year-olds and focuses to your goals, your risk preferences, and your uniqueness to create a personalized plan that works for you and evolves as you evolve, not one designed for an entire generation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/020617/your-financial-plan-depends-more-your-age/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You’re not alone. Financial planning jargon can be daunting when you’re just getting started.</p>\n<p>Understanding the difference between Fee-Only and Fee-Based, however, is important and could be the key to your long-term planning success.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Fee-Only Financial Planning?</strong></h2>\n<p>Fee-Only financial planners are legally registered as investment advisors and have a <em>fiduciary responsibility</em> to you to create a plan in your best interest. Fee-only advisors cannot accept any compensation as a result of product sales. In other words, they can’t make a commission from specific investments they recommend you purchase. They are paid directly by you – and only by you &#8211; either through an hourly fee, a retainer fee, or an agreed-upon percentage of your assets that they manage.</p>\n<p>As a result, in most cases, Fee-Only advisors have fewer conflicts of interest. They are more focused on <em>your</em> needs, rather than on selling you specific investments, since their compensation is not determined by sales volume or choice. A Fee-Only advisor will not try to steer you toward commissioned annuities; a Fee-Only planner’s advice must be completely free of attachment to financial products. The role of Fee-Only advisors is to only provide you advice that fits <em>your</em> current financial situation and your goals and therefore not recommend products and services that don’t support that goal and that are not the best choices for you.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Fee-Based Planning?</strong></h2>\n<p>“Fee-Based” is a category the brokerage community has created to take advantage of the success – and attractiveness &#8211; of Fee-Only advising. Because the terms sound so similar, it’s easy to think they are similar, but there is a major difference between Fee-Based planning and Fee-Only planning.</p>\n<p>In Fee-Based planning, the advisor is compensated with a set percentage of your assets instead of a retainer or a flat hourly fee. In addition to that percentage, Fee-based advisors can also accept commissions from financial products, annuities, and insurance products they sell you. Each time you purchase one of those products, their earnings increase.</p>\n<p>This leads to a fundamental conflict of interest. Your advisor wants to earn as much as possible while you want someone to provide honest and trustworthy guidance.</p>\n<p>If one fund offers advisors a significant commission and another one doesn’t but is better for you and your financial goals, how likely is it that the advisor will forego the opportunity to earn the commission by recommending the better fund?</p>\n<p>That is why the legally-binding Fiduciary Rule that Fee-Only Advisors follow is so important: the definition of a fiduciary relationship is one based on trust.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Make Sure Your Advisor is Fee-Only</strong></h2>\n<p>Before selecting an advisor, ask how and what their compensation plan looks like. Ask them to disclose what their compensation fees are in writing and whether or not they accept commissions. By choosing an advisor who provides Fee-Only services, you stand a greater chance of avoiding any conflicts of interests. Remember, Fee-Based advisors are obligated by their brokers or by specific deals to sell certain products. Fee-Only advisors are under no such requirements and have a legal, fiduciary, obligation to work for <em>you</em>, and you only.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/012017/paying-financial-advice-feeonly-vs-feebased/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
