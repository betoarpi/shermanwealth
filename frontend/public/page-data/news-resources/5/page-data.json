The Matrix?</p>\n<p>And does <strong>Financial Advisor</strong> conjure up a swaggering DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street? Or maybe someone in a Brooks Brothers suit, describing products you barely understand?</p>\n<p>If you said yes to either, you’re not alone.</p>\n<p>One common fear about the new wave of robo advisors is that, once you take the “red pill” and dive in, you’re no longer in control. You’ve turned your money over to a mysterious series of algorithms with no human in sight to help you guide it.</p>\n<p>Many investors – particularly younger ones – are also put off by the idea of bespoke-suited advisors from traditional firms who are trying to up-sell them investments and insurance products with hefty fees and commissions. And even if they were to opt for the more conservative “blue pill,” traditional advisories are often not interested in speaking with them because they can’t make the hefty minimum investment.</p>\n<p>While there is some truth to both stereotypes, there are also<strong> big shifts</strong> going on in the financial industry that make this a great time to take advantage of both a new breed of independent financial advisor and the efficiencies that targeted robo-platforms can provide.</p>\n<p>Here are the differences – as well as drawbacks and benefits &#8211; in a nutshell:</p>\n<p><strong>Robo Advisors:</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive compared to full-service portfolio management</li>\n<li>Lower barrier to entry: lower initial investment requirements</li>\n<li>Democratic: all clients benefit equally from algorithmic decisions, not just the big investors</li>\n<li>Data-driven: driven by numbers, trends, and deep data – not emotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited scope: robo advisor only handle investment management, not comprehensive financial planning</li>\n<li>Generic: they categorize you using broad-stroke demographic – not individualized- goal and risk-tolerance profiling to build your portfolio</li>\n<li>Automatic: selling or “rebalancing” can be triggered by pre-set formulas at times that you might be wiser to stay put</li>\n<li>Limited opportunities: many robo-firms currently have a limited or “preferred” set of funds and options you can invest in</li>\n<li>Impersonal: no human interaction for questions regarding your individual investment portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Traditional Financial Advisory Firms</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone who picks up the phone when you call or will see you when you make an appointment.</li>\n<li>Flexible: can make real-time decisions about what’s right for you or when to buy or sell not rather than being locked into formulas.</li>\n<li>Multi-layers of expertise to call on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier to entry: many traditional advisories have high minimums and confusing requirements and may only offer enhanced services to “premium” clients</li>\n<li>Conflict of interest: many advisories have a “corporate agenda” to promote certain products, or they follow a [Suitability Standard] that doesn’t necessarily put the clients’ interests above their own</li>\n<li>Change resistant: larger organizations can be “too big for their own good,” and slow to incorporate new tech or new processes that add value for their clients or address clients’ individual needs.</li>\n<li>Limited customization: established firms frequently use old-school models of demographics, risk allocation, and target dates without factoring in what makes each client unique</li>\n<li>Impersonal: while customer service is available, traditional firms often don’t truly “meet you where you are” and customize services and portfolios for you unless you have a large portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Enter the New Breed</strong></p>\n<p>A growing number of independent financial advisors are disrupting the traditional model and starting to create a “third way,” <strong>hybrid advisories</strong> that strive to offer all the pros and – hopefully &#8211; none of the cons. They offer clients customized fee-only services – unhindered by corporate agendas &#8211; and with a lower minimum investment. At the same time they are able to incorporate the newest tech tools that not only make it easy for new clients to get started, but also offer fast, best-in-class investment management modeling to make faster decisions about managing investments.</p>\n<p>Or, as Josh Brown so eloquently put it in <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2015/10/18/the-ballad-of-the-breakaway-broker/\">a recent blog post</a>, “…innovation and creative spirit is fleeing from the Old World to the new one.”</p>\n<p>So why haven’t all advisors embraced the new technology to offer enhanced services to their clients? The three biggest reasons are inertia, inertia, and inertia. It’s not easy to change entrenched business models, culture, and processes. Remember how Netflix caught the video rental business napping?</p>\n<p><strong>Why Not Just Go with a Robo Advisor?</strong></p>\n<p>Robo advisors generally only offer investment management, not comprehensive, goal-oriented financial planning. While both investment advisors and robo advisors can recommend investment direction, strategy, and allocation, a good financial advisor can help you identify goals, customize budgets and cash flow planning, and help you with insurance, credit, and debt management, things a robo-platform can’t do.</p>\n<p>The most important thing about the integration of new tech with personal attention and a customized plan is that a user-friendly tech interface can allow clients to manage all the pieces of their financial plans, from cash flow to 401Ks, while allowing an experienced advisor to monitor it and give clients a call when that advisor sees an opportunity, a red flag, or wants to check in about goals and direction.</p>\n<p>These days, clients can see through the bespoke suits; what they’re looking for is bespoke service. By embracing selected and appropriate technology, this new breed of independent financial advisors are able to offer all the “pros,” while creating a new model of more transparent, conflict-free financial management that’s available to everyone who wants to set – an achieve – financial goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/da113/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/3f132/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/8850c/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/da113/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/7223d/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/f2cbb/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/e9634/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"703037a2-0b3f-57b5-bc03-5866b40dd33e","slug":"the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor","title":"The Most Important Question You’ll Ever Ask Your Financial Advisor","content":"<p>Does your financial advisor follow the <strong>Fiduciary Standard</strong> or the <strong>Suitability Standard</strong>?</p>\n<p>If you don’t know the answer without peeking – or calling your Lifeline – you’re not alone. A surprising number of people don’t know what these very important terms mean and whether their advisor is acting in their best interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Aren’t all financial advisors required to act in their client’s best interest?</strong></p>\n<p>Surprisingly, not all financial advisors are.</p>\n<p>Broker-dealers, insurance salesman, and bank and financial company representatives, for instance, are only required to follow a <strong>Suitability Standard. </strong>That means they must provide recommendations that are “suitable” for a client – based on age for instance, or aversion to risk – but that may or may not be in that client’s best interest.</p>\n<p>Having a waiter recommend an expensive chocolate cake that is “suitable” for adults and for someone who is willing to risk trying chocolate with sea salt may not be that critical, in spite of the fact that having fresh strawberries may clearly be in your best interest. But having a financial advisor who is making recommendations primarily based on your age and risk tolerance – and who could be putting their own, or their company’s, financial interests ahead of your interests &#8212; could be disastrous for your financial future.</p>\n<p>Instead, the <strong>Fiduciary Standard</strong>, which is the standard for registered investment advisors under state and federal regulations, requires that <span style=\"color: #000066;\">a </span>financial advisor act <strong>solely</strong> in a client’s best interest when offering financial advice.</p>\n<p><strong>Registered Investment Advisors</strong> &#8211; like Sherman Wealth Management &#8211; must follow &#8211; and are held to &#8211; the <strong>Fiduciary Standard.</strong> That means that a RIA must put their client’s needs ahead of their own, provide fully-disclosed, conflict-free advice, be fully transparent about fees, and continue to monitor a client’s investments, as well as their changing financial situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s a potential scenario that illustrates the differences</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say your broker-dealer has three possible funds to recommend to you. The first is a “suitable” index fund, offered by her own company, which pays her a 6% commission on the sale and charges a 2% annual fee. The second is a similarly suitable index fund that would pay her a 3% commission on the sale and has a 1% annual fee. The third is an index fund that has no sales commission and an annual fee of .5%. Under the Suitability Standard, she can recommend the higher priced fund and still satisfy the standard. Under the Fiduciary Standard, she would be required to recommend the third fund.</p>\n<p>This is not to suggest that broker-dealers or others operating under the Suitability Standard don’t look out for their clients.  While many reps who follow the Suitability Standard give their clients excellent advice, they operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest.</p>\n<p>So go ahead and let the waiter talk you into that chocolate cake (even though you know you’ll feel better tomorrow if you have the strawberries.) But when it comes to your money, think carefully about whose advice you are taking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.finra.org/investors/suitability-what-investors-need-know\">http://www.finra.org/investors/suitability-what-investors-need-know</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://financialplanningcoalition.com/issues/fiduciary-standard-of-care/\">http://financialplanningcoalition.com/issues/fiduciary-standard-of-care/</a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/bb4d2c992b7829d5ac4ade769e774edd/da113/1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/bb4d2c992b7829d5ac4ade769e774edd/3f132/1-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/bb4d2c992b7829d5ac4ade769e774edd/8850c/1-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/bb4d2c992b7829d5ac4ade769e774edd/da113/1-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/bb4d2c992b7829d5ac4ade769e774edd/7223d/1-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/bb4d2c992b7829d5ac4ade769e774edd/f2cbb/1-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/bb4d2c992b7829d5ac4ade769e774edd/b61ad/1-1.jpg 818w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"2c08b073-6e22-5a17-b997-ea87ec8e38b2","slug":"donald-trump-and-the-benefit-of-financial-foresight","title":"Donald Trump and the Benefit of Financial Foresight","content":"<p>Donald Trump’s current net worth – as he would be the first to tell you &#8211; is estimated to be between $2 and $4 billion, most of which he made through inheritance and real estate investments, along with other business dealings. <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/09/02/1-easy-way-donald-trump-could-have-been-even-richer-doing-nothing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An article in National Journal</a> recently took a look at what might have happened if he had invested in an S&amp;P 500 index fund back in 1982 when his inherited real estate fortune was estimated to be worth “only” $200 million.  According to National Journal’s calculations, if he’d invested carefully in index funds, Trump’s net worth would be a whopping $8 billion today.</p>\n<p>Does this mean Donald Trump is a bad investor? Not necessarily: the oldest lesson on Wall Street is that everything is easy in hindsight.</p>\n<p>While highly speculative, those numbers do highlight the ongoing debate over which is a better investment – real estate instruments or stocks. Both stocks have and the real estate market have had great runs in recent history and, depending on when you invested, you could make cases for both investments being the better choice.</p>\n<p>But the stock market and the real estate market both experience volatility, dips, and extended recovery times so, for the average investor, a portfolio composed of mainly real estate or other fixed assets (like art or collectibles, for instance) poses some risks that should be hedged with proper cash flow planning, a diversified portfolio, and proper tax planning.</p>\n<p><strong>Cash Flow Planning</strong></p>\n<p>A good financial plan takes into account how much cash you need access to, or may need access to in the future. Cash flow planning should be a key factor in deciding whether real estate investments are part your individualized financial strategy.</p>\n<p>As National Journal points out, Trump claims he is willing to spend upwards of $1 billion of his own money to fund his presidential campaign, yet his financial disclosure statements show that he may have less than $200 million in cash, stocks, and bonds. The rest of his fortune is tied up in real estate investments, which could be much harder to liquidate and use for his campaign.</p>\n<p>Most of us aren’t running for president but, if something like the 2007 housing collapse were to happen again, any investor who is predominantly invested in real estate could have problems liquidating those – diminished &#8211; assets for retirement, college funding, or other non-presidential goals.</p>\n<p>A solution: diversification.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you are investing in real estate or the stock market, diversification is always a prudent way to address your own risk tolerance and use proper foresight in creating a winning strategy.</p>\n<p>While with real estate funds, diversification can be achieved via many factors, including residential vs commercial investments, differing location focuses, and differing interest rates and financing mechanisms, it is still fundamentally one sector, subject to sentiment and swings.</p>\n<p>With the stock market, on the other hand, diversification allows you the opportunity to invest not only in different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and money market funds, but in a variety of sectors and industries as well. Over the past 60 years, historically, the stock market has averaged an <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp#sthash.TXk7awA7.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8% annual return</a>, so investors with strategically balanced and diversified portfolios, there is the opportunity for steady, while not spectacular gains, with the potential for less risk than investing only in the real estate market.</p>\n<p>An investor who is properly diversified through multiple asset classes – including real estate if it makes sense for their own customized strategy – is potentially better protected against the short term results of one asset class experiencing a crash or a prolonged dip.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is that options for investing in real estate in IRAs and other tax-deferred accounts are complicated and not every custodian will allow you to include real estate investments in a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/self-directed-real-estate-iras.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax-deferred account</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hindsight vs Foresight</strong></p>\n<p>While Donald Trump is an outlier because his high net worth shelters him from some of the issues with primarily being invested in real estate, it’s intriguing to consider “what if.”</p>\n<p>In the case of a more typical investor, a little foresight can go a long way in making sure you are on your way to achieving your own financial goals. A sound financial plan should be tailored to individual goals and cash flow needs, with a customized cash flow plan, and diversified across multiple asset classes for the potential for steady and compounded growth over time.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a Donald Trump with a large inheritance or a young professional just getting started, a solid plan and strategy puts the benefit of hindsight where it belongs: in a conversation over coffee or cocktails, and not as the basis for a winning investment strategy.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/da113/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/3f132/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/8850c/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/da113/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/7223d/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/f2cbb/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/e9634/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"2df769dc-c469-5f76-b844-fd9b2d28337c","slug":"ryans-open-letter-to-cnbc","title":"My Response To a Millennial&#8217;s Open Letter To CNBC","content":"<p>After the markets took an incredibly volatile ride on August 24th, zerohedge.com published <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-24/one-millennials-letter-cnbc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this letter</a> to CNBC from a millennial named Ryan, who wrote:</p>\n<p><em>“I&#8217;ve dipped my toes in the stock market this past year but after today&#8217;s action, I have to say I&#8217;m done.

And this season, as in previous ones, fans will be wondering why some fantasy team managers just seem to have a knack for finding those sleepers and high upside players, while other managers routinely fail to understand and predict player value.</p>\n<p>Investors often wonder the same thing: why do some investors consistently get it right and prosper, while others are lucky if they even break even?</p>\n<p>Coincidence? Maybe, but there are several important things successful fantasy football managers have in common with successful real-life investors.</p>\n<p>Here are three important mindsets that can help you go the whole 9 yards, whether it’s on the virtual gridiron or with your own financial plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Research the Players</strong></p>\n<p>A good fantasy football manager knows that you need to study all the different variables &#8211; including roster positions, draft picks, and expected performance – to build a winning team. Understanding the available options is critical to determining things like how many players you need at each position and which players you think will be the best.</p>\n<p>This same principal applies to investing. A smart investor or financial advisor starts by understanding all the different variables, such as capital, types of investments, and asset classes. Understanding the pros and cons of various investment strategies is critical in determining how to choose a strategy that is the appropriate option for your own goals and needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Never count on a couple of stars to carry the team</strong></p>\n<p>When drafting your fantasy team, you always want to diversify your risk. You might not want to draft multiple offense players from the Green Bay Packers, for instance, even if that team is loaded with talent, because, if Aaron Rodgers and company have a bad week, your fantasy team will be struggling too. Smart fantasy managers build a stable foundation and don’t just count on rising stars.</p>\n<p>When building your investment portfolio, risk diversification is critical as well. Wall Street is littered with stories of investors who put all their eggs in one “sure” basket, only to learn the lesson of diversification the hard way. Even if you’re extremely confident that a certain sector is a good bet, it’s usually better to diversify and limit your amount of exposure to individual sectors. That way, even if the sector doesn’t do as well as you had anticipated, your investments are distributed across other asset classes, and your risk should be better managed.</p>\n<p><strong>When the going gets tough, the tough stay disciplined</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who has played fantasy football knows the danger of making a snap waiver wire decision you’ll regret later. On one hand, you don’t want to panic and drop your star player after a rough few weeks, only to see him rebound to a MVP-caliber season (and on someone else’s team!) On the other hand, just because an unproven player has a great week doesn’t mean he’s more valuable than the player you’d have to drop in order to acquire him.</p>\n<p>When the market hits a volatile patch, it takes a disciplined investor to trust their plan and avoid making snap decisions about buying and selling. A look at the history of the stock market makes it abundantly clear that investors who take a long term view do better than those who shift their investment strategies with every changing wind. This doesn’t mean that any plan should be viewed as foolproof; a good investor or financial advisor knows the value of reassessing and recalibrating appropriately and strategically. What it does mean is that, when the going gets tough, a prudent investor takes the long view, stays disciplined, and sticks to a strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s a long season</strong></p>\n<p>The only NFL team in history to have an undefeated season is the Miami Dolphins who finished 17-0 in the shorter 1972 season. No NFL team has gone 19-0 to date so it’s highly unlikely that any fantasy team will achieve perfection either. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have a great season and get smarter and smarter about putting together a winning team.</p>\n<p>With investing too, there will always be ups and downs, touchdowns and penalties, fumbles and conversions, and a few Hail Mary’s. But with a solid game plan and clearly defined goal, you’ll be on your way to a putting together a strategy designed to stand the test of time and put you squarely where you want to be: heading toward your own end zone with your eye on the ball and your own goals in sight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1304073-091715</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAgGBgcGBQgHBwcJCQgKDBQNDAsLDBkSEw8UHRofHh0aHBwgJC4nICIsIxwcKDcpLDAxNDQ0Hyc5PTgyPC4zNDL/2wBDAQkJCQwLDBgNDRgyIRwhMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjL/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQCAwUG/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQID/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFqzCfMZnOFH//EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxMABBIj/9oACAEBAAEFAg8PJoqLLmsPORjXMxST/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIUA//aAAgBAwEBPwGXMlQ//8QAGREAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQDBFFS/9oACAECAQE/AWp+hmxp/8QAHBAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECESExQUJx/9oACAEBAAY/AqbNL2jFEZcks9iotpH/xAAcEAEAAwADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFhUZH/2gAIAQEAAT8h0dXvUOtA91cvhgHsGzreXZz1gr8jX4QM/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABA83//EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESFR/9oACAEDAQE/EFFaHkf/xAAZEQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFRkdH/2gAIAQIBAT8QcnAquH//xAAgEAEAAgECBwAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMWFBUXGBocHR/9oACAEBAAE/EDjBaw8PkHmNQQk35QSIIFU9xIDTLq14Xp2hX0LsMK6So8hthbtP/9k=","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/da113/Football3-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/3f132/Football3-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/8850c/Football3-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/da113/Football3-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/7223d/Football3-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/f2cbb/Football3-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/e9634/Football3-1.jpg 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"98bc4a93-0c90-5648-9b32-8c97610de630","slug":"volatility-compound-interest","title":"Straight Talk about Volatility and Compound Interest &#8211; the Snowball Effect","content":"<p>Compound interest is, simply put, the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment has already earned.</p>\n<p>Why is it important?

If a 2-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny circumference. As it keeps rolling, its surface grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution.</p>\n<p>If you invest $1000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2158.93, in 20 years that will be $4660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. All it takes is patience to turn $1000 &#8211; the price of one ski weekend &#8211; into $21,724.52.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to start saving early.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1861\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-1024x786.jpg\" alt=\"chart25\" width=\"976\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-1024x786.jpg 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-300x230.jpg 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-768x589.jpg 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px\" /></a></p>\n<h5><em>The above chart is hypothetical and assumes an 8% rate of return compounded annually. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any specific investment.   Investment return and principal values will fluctuate so that your investment when redeemed may be worth more or less than its original cost. Rates of return do not include fees and charges, which are inherent to other investment products. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</em></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Volatility &#8211; Market Highs and Lows</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what happens if the market dips and your investment loses value?</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong> &#8211; when market value fluctuates up and down – can be an opportunity for disciplined savers who contribute regularly to their investments, regardless of share price. When prices are low, you’re able to buy more shares. When prices are high you’re able to buy fewer shares for the same amount but those shares earn more interest, which is called Dollar Cost Averaging (<em>Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.</em>)</p>\n<p>Imagine that snowball again, rolling down a hill, acquiring more and more snow as it goes. What happens when it hits a bare patch with no snow? Often it picks up rocks and pebbles, which add even more surface volume. So, when it hits the snow again, it picks up even more because it’s larger.</p>\n<p>That’s how compound interest, coupled with regular investments, may work too: the “rough patches” produce more volume, which then allows you to acquire more compounded interest. So if you buy more shares during a dip, when the market recovers you could hypothetically not only earn compound interest on more shares, you earn more interest. So long as the price of your particular investment recovers, of course.</p>\n<p>As Josh Brown points out in his recent blog post about Warren Buffett and David Tepper, both these legendary investors have gotten to where they are today because they’ve successfully ridden out volatility. In 1998 Warren Buffets own Berkshire Hathaway’s “A” shares had dropped in price from approximately $80,000 to $59,000 but Buffet didn’t sell. Those shares just hit a high of $229,000 this year.</p>\n<p>If you see volatility &#8211; like what we experienced in August &#8211; as a tool and keep contributing regularly to your investments, you’ll potentially maximize the effect of compounded interest and watch your investments snowball over time!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1174145-041515</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>******</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additional Reading:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HopNTVEJvn\"><p><a href=\"https://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/13/how-two-of-historys-greatest-investors-deal-with-losses/\">How two of history&#8217;s greatest investors deal with losses</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;How two of history&#8217;s greatest investors deal with losses&#8221; &#8212; The Reformed Broker\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/13/how-two-of-historys-greatest-investors-deal-with-losses/embed/#?secret=HopNTVEJvn\" data-secret=\"HopNTVEJvn\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>http://awealthofcommonsense.com/did-investors-just-experience-the-best-risk-adjusted-returns-ever/</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator\">http://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator</a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5151515151515151,"src":"/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/da113/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/3f132/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/8850c/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/da113/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/7223d/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/82ce4/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 752w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"2894ecdf-b9ed-59f5-9150-779c69464dc5","slug":"millennials-time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-stock-market","title":"Millennials – Time to Wake Up and Smell the Stock Market","content":"<p>On Monday, as things were heating up a bit, Cullen Roche <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cullenroche/status/635820302937796608\">tweeted</a> “The stock market is the only market where things go on sale and all the customers run out of the store&#8230;”</p>\n<p>The problem is, many Millennials weren’t even <u>in</u> the store.</p>\n<p>Only 26 percent of people under age 30 own stocks, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/more-millennials-say-no-to-stocks-and-advisors-adapt.html\">CNBC story </a>that same day. That means that, while not panicking, most Millennials may have been missing one of the biggest potential opportunities of the past 10 years.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Aren’t Millennials Investing?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are many theories –from Millennials being shell-shocked by experiencing their families’ anxiety in 2008, to YOLO, the feeling that it’s better to spend and enjoy the money now because who knows what the future may bring. The problem is that the future is likely to bring a whole lot fewer opportunities if you haven’t planned properly!</p>\n<h3><strong>Are You Even Beating Inflation? </strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s say hypothetically that the stock market may rebound by 5%&#8230; Simple, common sense math shows that keeping your money in the bank at .05% interest means it would take you 100 years to make the same amount of money that investing it now could. And the cash you are saving under the mattress or in one of your vintage vinyl sleeves? That money is just losing value every second you leave it there, as the cost of blankets and concert tickets continues to climb with inflation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Risk, Volatility, and Paper Losses</strong></h3>\n<p>It’s important to know the difference between risk and volatility and many people get it wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong> – stock prices moving up and down – is a normal part of the stock market <u>and</u> an opportunity for a disciplined saver to buy when the market is both up and down. When you have a solid plan in place you can capitalize on market price dislocations, like what happened this week. <strong>Risk</strong> is how likely you are to lose it all and it’s important to remember – while everyone has their own risk tolerance – price corrections and market volatility does not necessarily mean you are going to lose it all. As the chart below borrowed from The Irrelevant Investor’s <a href=\"https://theirrelevantinvestor.wordpress.com/2015/08/24/should-investors-stay-the-course/#more-1843\">excellent post</a> on staying the course shows, the stock market has historically climbed in spite of dips. And <strong>paper losses</strong> are just that: it’s not real loss if you don’t sell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1819\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png\" alt=\"stock market drops\" width=\"640\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png 640w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1-300x203.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As this chart by Deutsche Bank’s <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.in/There-are-2-big-problems-with-blaming-China-for-the-stock-market-sell-off/articleshow/48670991.cms\">Torsten Slok</a> shows, in spite of other times of great volatility, markets have always recovered.

So no excuses &#8211; there are financial pros ready help you create an investment strategy that makes sense for your personal goals and financial situation. And volatility doesn’t disrupt what we do!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’ve got a solid financial plan, investing in the stock market does not affect your ability to pay your rent, take care of yourself or your family, or add to that rainy day emergency fund. The money you’re saving and investing is money that you’ve determined <em>you don’t need now</em>, it’s money you have set aside for the long haul. Assuming your planner has planned correctly, you’re not going to miss your car payment because the Chinese stock market is crashing.</p>\n<p>And that huge correction that scared you in 2008?

From scouring the finance blogs and Twitter for the latest “surefire” ways to beat the market, to diagnosing our aches on WebMD, to grilling along with Bobby Flay on YouTube, it can seem like we have almost instant access to the same information as the pros.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to personal finances, why is it necessary to have a financial advisor when financial news is so readily available, Twitter is flooded with “hot tips,” robo advisors are ready to automate the whole process for you, and comparison shopping is so easy? Why can’t you just use this treasure trove of information to make your own financial decisions? Or subscribe to an algorithm-based service that will make the best lightning-quick decisions for you?</p>\n<p>A couple of reasons&#8230;</p>\n<p>If you’re good and you dedicate a lot of time online, you can definitely pick up some great information and strategies that the experts are sharing (follow me on Twitter by clicking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shermanwealth\">here</a>!) The tricky part is making sure that the information and the strategies are actually appropriate for you and appropriate right now. We all know that, if we’re not careful, the instantaneous nature of the internet, social media, and impersonal algorithms can lead to impulsive decisions that may not support our own long-term goals and personal risk profile. Quick reactions to new stock market “darlings” or to sudden market volatility can lead to choices that are not the best for your long &#8211; or even near – term financial health and growth. In fact, there is a whole science called Behavioral Finance that addresses how personal biases can lead investors to make decisions that actually work against the goals they set for themselves.</p>\n<p>A good financial professional is able to sift through the vast amount of information available to you and determine what is significant to your strategy and what may just be a distraction. A financial advisor who understands Behavioral Finance can help you see where your assumptions, habits, and biases about money and investing may be leading you to get in your own way.</p>\n<p>The new algorithm-based platforms are increasingly interesting and have a lot of merit, but the level of personalization is not yet very deep. That means that portfolios are based on broad criteria that may have nothing to do with your current situation, lifestyle, and goals. Again, this is where a trained professional will be able to view your unique individual needs and create a tailored strategy that is geared to you and not just everyone who matches your age and salary level. As more and more fiduciary financial advisors are starting to use smart algorithms as part of their offerings where appropriate, the key is “where appropriate” and “in the clients’ best interest,” the very definition of a fiduciary.</p>\n<p>Think about it: would you rather grill along with Bobby Flay on your iPad or would you rather have regular meetings with Bobby, where he looks at the size and model of your Weber, the size of your shrimp, and the recipes you’re trying to learn, and works with you to make sure you become the master of your own grill? (and shrimp!)</p>\n<p>The same goes for your financial future. While do-it-yourself is getting easier and easier, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s getting better and better. Look for a fiduciary financial advisor who also has access to the latest information online and is familiar with the latest algorithmic innovations, but who uses that information to get to know clients individually, and tailors a long-term growth strategy for them that will put them on the road to achieving the goals they have set for themselves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p>With over a decade’s worth of experience in financial services, Brad Sherman is committed to helping his clients pursue their financial goals.

Rule #1: Don’t Panic","content":"<p>Whenever there’s a crisis, it’s good to have an emergency plan, and when there’s a financial crisis, it’s good to have a financial emergency plan. When you’ve thought through a plan, it’s less likely that panic &#8211; or other “behavioral mistakes” &#8211; will lead you to react in ways you may be regretting for a long time.</p>\n<p>While most investors say they’ll continue to hold on to their investments when there’s a sharp downturn (and many even say that they’ll add money when their investments go down), data tells a far different story. In December 2008, right as the market was near its lowest point, investors pulled out a whopping $10.6 billion from equity mutual funds alone.</p>\n<p>Panicking during market bottoms is a form of “behavioral bias” that can have a devastating effect on financial health. While the S&amp;P 500 has averaged around 10% a year, costly behavioral mistakes cause many individual investors to significantly <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/11621555/1/average-investor-20-year-return-astoundingly-awful.html\">miss those gains.</a> That’s because, despite good advice, people still tend to put money in the stock market as it rises and pull money out as the market falls. The result: many investors buy <a href=\"http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/are-we-buying-high-all-over-again/?scp=1&amp;sq=buy%20low%20stocks&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=1#sthash.kSv3JRiw.dpuf\">at market tops</a> and sell at market bottoms.</p>\n<p>While none of us are immune to behavioral biases, there are several things we can do to help avoid costly mistakes.</p>\n<h3><strong> 1.  Learn From the Past</strong></h3>\n<p>The first step is to understand that market declines are a normal part of investing and resist the urge to panic!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1472\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1472\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://theirrelevantinvestor.tumblr.com/post/113520921728/where-do-stocks-go-from-here-after-six-years-of\"><img class=\"wp-image-1472 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1.jpg\" alt=\"tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540\" width=\"540\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1.jpg 540w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1-300x160.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CRSP 1-10 Index</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While the S&amp;P has historically returned almost 10% annually since the 1960s, those returns are not consistent. One year the market could be up 20% and the next it could decline 12%! To make the ride even bumpier: the market also has streaks where returns decline for several consecutive years. That’s when investors often begin to panic and pull their money out. Unfortunately, that’s usually the worst time to do so, and when investors often should be increasing their investments instead.</p>\n<p>Although the market can move up and down in the course of a year, or several years, it has historically trended upwards over longer periods of time (10 or 20 years.) So if your investment horizon is longer than just a few years, remember that it’s likely the market will <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">recover its losses</a> &#8211; and then some &#8211; over time.</p>\n<p>Understanding that the U.S. stock market bounces back after its declines is a helpful first step in creating “un-biased” financial habits!</p>\n<h3>2.  <strong>Understand that Accepting Lower Returns May be Okay </strong></h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, younger investors have more years ahead of them to invest. That means they are often able to put a higher percentage of their money in stocks and a very low, or even zero, percentage in bonds. How much you allocate to stocks will depend on factors such as your own investment objectives and your ability to tolerate risk.</p>\n<p>If you know that you’re prone to panicking during market declines, however, you may want to keep your portfolio in more conservative investments than your age and investment horizon would normally indicate.</p>\n<p>It’s much better to be a bit more conservative and hold on to your investments during market downturns, than to buy riskier assets and sell during market crashes!</p>\n<h3><strong> 3.  Speak with a Professional</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’re like most Americans, chances are you spend more time researching your next car than researching your investments!</p>\n<p>Investing can be a difficult &#8211; and sometimes dry &#8211; subject. Learning about the history of the stock market, your own risk tolerance, and behavioral biases that can trip you up is challenging for most people and probably something you don’t want to spend a lot of time on.</p>\n<p>That’s where a trusted financial planner can help.</p>\n<p>A good financial planner can help guide you along the path in planning for your own financial goals; explain difficult concepts; help you discover your own risk tolerance; recommend appropriate investments based on those risk tolerances; and help you avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people’s portfolios.</p>\n<p>A good financial planner also understands the history of the market and knows that, while bull markets don’t last forever, declines are generally temporary as well. Knowing that, and having a plan tailored to your specific financial goals will help you to avoid panicking when markets go south, and avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people’s portfolios.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brad Sherman is a financial advisor based in Gaithersburg Maryland who is experienced in understanding both the history of the market, as well as how behavioral biases affect investor returns.

These three simple steps will give your increased focus and will help you move closer to that goal.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve incorporated them in your daily routine, identify a second goal and follow the same plan. The key to success is taking it one step at a time!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy Use Downtime Wisely </strong></h3>\n<p>At the end of your workday, do you like to relax with Netflix, video games, or YouTube? According to Corley’s data, <strong>66%</strong> of the wealthy said that they watch less than an hour of television a day, <strong>63%</strong> spend less than an hour a day on the Internet unless it is job-related, an impressive <strong>79%</strong> say they read career and educational material each day, and an equally impressive <strong>63%</strong> said &#8220;I listen to audio books during the commute to work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While we all like to relax and recharge with entertaining media, that time can never be recovered for things that help you become a stronger, more successful individual like reading, networking, exercising, or volunteering for a cause you believe in.</p>\n<p>Time is the great equalizer: we all have 24 hours a day. What you choose to do with that time can either help you to reach your financial and life goals, or distract you from it, so choose wisely!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy Invest in Their Future </strong></h3>\n<p>Corley’s research also showed that <a href=\"http://www.success.com/article/16-rich-habits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the wealthy live within their means</a>, pay themselves first, and don’t overspend.</p>\n<p>Building wealth is not accomplished by upgrading to each new electronic gadget, leasing the newest model car, and living in an extravagant home. The wealthy, according to Corley, spend less than they earn, own and maintain their cars for many years, and save a significant portion of their income. While saving money and living modestly is not as sexy as a flashy smartphone, it will go a lot further toward providing a comfortable future.</p>\n<p>Living within your means also includes not carrying credit card balances or heavy debt. When you are carrying debt, what you earn today is paying for yesterday’s expenses. Living within your means while saving and investing a portion of your income lets you invest in tomorrow, rather than yesterday, while learning to be satisfied with what you have today.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy are Willing to Take Risks </strong></h3>\n<p>Another fascinating finding of Corley’s research is that<strong> 63%</strong> of the wealthy people he interviewed said they that they had <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ways-rich-people-think-differently-2014-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taken risks</a> in search of wealth, while only 6% of the struggling Americans he interviewed said that they had taken risks.</p>\n<p>For many, fear of failure is a great de-motivator and can be paralyzing. When you do not fully understand something, whether it’s a challenge, a potential project, an investment, or even a social problem, it can be easier to do nothing than to act. But without risk, there is often no reward.</p>\n<p>What Corley discovered is that, instead, rather than fearing failure, the wealthy consider failure to be part of the process and – most importantly &#8211; an opportunity to learn.</p>\n<p>How can you face risk without fear so that you can seize potential opportunities? Educating yourself is the key step. Researching the investment, the project, or the choice, and learning about the options and risks, help keep fear and anxiety about the unknown from clouding your decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Even with the best preparation though, choices don’t turn out as envisioned. When that happens, take a page from the wealthy: learning from those failures and experiences will lead to more opportunities and better choices down the road!</p>\n<h3><strong>Are Your Own Habits Setting You Up for Success?</strong></h3>\n<p>While following each of these habits may not make you rich, they will certainly help you get into a success mind-set. <strong>68%</strong> of the Americans on Forbes billionaire list consider themselves to be “<a href=\"http://www.business-management-degree.net/features/wealthiest-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-made billionaires</a>,” which means that they worked hard to reach their own professional and financial goals. The true route to financial success is through discipline and steady habits that grow your net worth over time.</p>\n<p>Do you already share these four habits of the wealthy?

Here Are 4 Simple Steps To Get You Started","content":"<p>Close your eyes for a moment and envision where you’d like to be in 30 or 40 years… Are you sailing to Tahiti? Writing that book? Running your vineyard? Building a new company?</p>\n<p>If you had trouble envisioning where you’d like to be, you’re not alone. But unless you can visualize it, unless you’ve got your destination planned, it can be hard to get there. That’s why it’s so important to start thinking about what your goals currently are &#8211; whether it’s for yourself, your career, your startup, your art, and/or your family &#8211; and take the first – or the next – steps to invest in your future.</p>\n<p>What does investing mean? Very simply, it means putting your money somewhere you expect it to grow. It can be traditional stocks, bonds and mutual funds, or real estate, collectibles, annuities, and other things that are expected to gain value over time.</p>\n<p>When you’re just starting out, thinking about &#8211; and setting aside money for &#8211; your future can feel like a challenge; when you&#8217;ve just set up your first lemonade stand and barely breaking even, it’s hard to think about re-investing part of your profits in lemon groves that will someday produce income for you.</p>\n<p>The trick is to overcome inertia, get started, and make a commitment, even if it’s just a tiny first step.</p>\n<h3><strong>Inertia is not your friend</strong></h3>\n<p>Inertia is one of the biggest reasons people waste opportunities to started investing when they’re young.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Objects at rest tend to stay at rest:</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not investing yet, or if your money is sitting in a non-income producing bank account it can be hard to get started or get moving.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Objects in motion tend to stay in motion:</em></strong></p>\n<p>If your money is constantly in motion, if you’re spending everything you make, or if your money is following the crowd to the next big glamour stock, it can be hard to slow down and take stock with a Financial Planner to build a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>A study by Hewitt Associates found, for instance, that only 31% of employees in their 20s invest in their company’s 401K plan¹. That means almost 70% of young employees who could be investing in a matching 401k plan haven’t started taking advantage of what is essentially free money. Whether inertia is keeping them from getting started, or inertia is keeping their money in motion so that there’s none left over to invest, they are not only leaving free money on the table, they’re not letting that money grow through compounding.</p>\n<p>According to an article in US News and World Report, if you start investing just $100 a month in your 20s, increase contributions as your income increases, and make good financial decisions along the way, you are on your way to potentially retiring with over 1 million dollars.²</p>\n<h3><strong>How Do You Get Started?</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are four simple steps to get you past inertia and get you started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find your motivation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are all passionate about certain things. The more you care, the more focused you are about achieving your goals. Make a list of the things that are important to you and the things you want to achieve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find extra money</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are only two ways to “find” money &#8211; spending less or making more. While it may seem daunting – inertia again! – you’d be surprised by how easy it is to discover places you can cut back a little or spend a little less. And, while you have a lot more control over your spending than your earnings, you can also look for ways to find extra sources of income, work more hours, or even get a better paying job.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Move financial goals up</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you plan to save “whatever you have left” or “whatever you’ve saved” at the end of each month, don’t be surprised by how little that actually is. We all have a tendency to spend what we have, and spend more as our income goes up. You can avoid that pitfall by paying yourself first. When you prioritize saving in your budget and take that money “out of circulation,” your spending will fall in line.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get advice from an adviser you trust</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The world of finance and investing can be complicated and confusing. Don’t let fear of the unknown keep you from getting started. You don’t need a large amount of savings to meet with an adviser who can answer a lot of your questions. Getting a roadmap from someone who knows the territory will help you get started and may allow for a smoother journey.</p>\n<p>Investing in your future is an investment in yourself. If you take these four simple steps, even with limited assets, you’ll be laying the foundation for a lifetime of investing in your own plans and goals, and your own vision of financial freedom.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>All investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Putting money into the market when you’re young &#8211; even small amounts &#8211; gives your investments time to grow and compound over time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, too many millennials haven’t gotten started yet. A recent survey by Bankrate found that only 26% of Americans under 30 were invested in the stock market, compared to 58% between the ages of 58 and 64. (1)</p>\n<p>While the stock market has historically seen positive returns over the long run, it’s not hard to understand why many millennials are wary of it. Millennials under 30 have seen two major market crashes: the tech bubble of the late 1990’s as well as the 2008 economic crisis. Many saw how family members and friends lost years worth of savings and were often financially devastated by what happened.</p>\n<p>The result: a deep distrust of Wall Street and a desire to avoid the market altogether.</p>\n<p>While it is understandable that millennials are wary about putting their earnings into the market, it’s also unfortunate.</p>\n<p>In spite of the two crises of 1990 and 2008, if you had invested in the S&amp;P 500 at the beginning of 1985, and kept that money in until the end of 2014, you would have earned over 25 times what you had initially invested. (2) (3)</p>\n<p>Even saving just a small amount each week or month would have made a tremendous difference in your retirement savings.</p>\n<h4><strong><em>The Second Mistake</em></strong></h4>\n<p>While many millennials make the mistake of investing too little in the market, others make another critical mistake. While they may be making regular contributions, they may not be invested in a wide enough variety of securities.</p>\n<p>The youngest generations have grown up with access to the internet, social media, online financial media, and the tools to invest in any publicly traded security that they choose and they feel empowered to make investment decisions on their own, without consulting a professional. They’re also able to trade information with friends and make changes to their portfolio in a matter of seconds using their smartphone or computer.</p>\n<p>Because of this, millennials are often invested in individual hot stocks, companies they believe in, or companies that sell products they use and like. This can (and will) work for some investors sometimes as a result of sheer luck and the law of large numbers, but it is not a consistent – or wise &#8211; strategy to rely on.</p>\n<h4><strong><em>Buying What’s in the News</em></strong></h4>\n<p>In 2007 researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Davis published a paper where they showed that individual investors have a tendency to buy stocks that had recently been in the news, or that had share prices that had recently gone up (4). By buying these “hot” stocks, new investors were forced to bid up the price to a higher level than they were before the news story came out. The study showed that, because these investors were buying at an artificially higher price, their portfolios ended up performing poorly as a result of having bought these ‘hot stocks’.</p>\n<p>Additionally many millennials choose to engage in “socially responsible” investing, avoiding stocks in companies that sell products they don’t believe in, or that engage in business practices they feel are undesirable, and putting their money in companies that they believe in and feel good about.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this too can have a negative impact on their returns over the long run. By focusing so narrowly, their portfolios are missing a major piece of the market, which limits their diversification. Additionally social responsible investments can have higher fees than their non-SRI counterparts, because they have the added cost of screening out stocks based on certain criteria.</p>\n<p>Along with the added costs, and the decrease in diversification that result in focusing only on SRIs, researchers from Princeton and New York University published a paper in 2009 that showed that ‘sin stocks’ have historically outperformed their non-sin counterparts. (5)</p>\n<p>Whether you are choosing to invest your money in a single stock, or several stocks, or you choose to invest in a SRI investment, you are limiting your investment choices, which in turn limits your level of diversification and possibly your returns over the long run.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: if you avoid these two critical mistakes by starting to save – and invest &#8211; early, and by making sure your portfolio is diversified, you’ll be setting yourself up to watch your money grow over time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Broad-based investment vehicles with low fees and high levels of diversification, if appropriate to their specific circumstances, is one strategy to help clients toward their goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102602094\">http://www.cnbc.com/id/102602094</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm</a></li>\n<li>The S&amp;P 500 index is representative of domestic markets and includes the average performance of 500 widely held common stocks.

If so, you know the full range of emotions that come with a growing family. Along with the love and excitement you feel with a new baby boy or girl, comes the pressure of new responsibilities and additional financial obligations.</p>\n<p>Babies change your life in many ways, including requiring large amounts of time and money. While you may already be thinking about childcare costs and options, or about paying the medical bills that accompanied your new child, there are several other – important &#8211; financial considerations you should be thinking about even before the new baby arrives.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate Financial Priorities</strong>. It’s important to consider both short-term and long-term expenses that come with the addition of a new family member. It is a natural impulse, for instance, to want to put your child first and redirect retirement savings into college savings. But remember, you can borrow for college but you cannot borrow your way through retirement. It’s also important to balance long-term goals, like retirement and college expenses, with current financial needs, to help you allocate resources in an appropriate way.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Insurance Needs and Your Will</strong>. With the expansion of your family, insurance needs can change significantly. Having enough insurance is important in feeling confident about your family’s financial future. Adding your child to your health insurance policy can usually be done with a phone call. Making sure you have enough life insurance for both parents can help ensure you have the funds to raise your child if the unthinkable happens. Short-term disability insurance provides benefits if you have an accident that takes you out of work temporarily. Long-term disability insurance is critical in case a major accident has a permanent impact on your ability to work and earn. While some companies offer disability insurance, it can also be purchased independently.</p>\n<p>Updating your will or creating a trust can provide care instructions for your child and allocate resources for their upbringing. Without a will or trust, if you and your spouse die, the state will decide who will raise your children. A will establishes your wishes for who will care for your child. A trust can direct funds specifically earmarked for raising your children and can be an effective way to cover financial expenses and provide for college expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Start Planning For College Early</strong>. The sooner you start the better. While it is impossible to know exactly how much you’ll need to save &#8211; given that you don’t know what kind of college your child will choose – consider that in 2013-2014 the cost of a moderate in-state public university was $22,826 per academic year and the cost of a “moderate” private university averaged <strong>$44,750</strong>, according to a College Board survey. ¹</p>\n<p>For new parents this means that college could cost over <strong>$100,000</strong> for a public college and more than double that number for private school. Instead of trying to fund the entire cost of their education, determine how much you want to contribute. Having children be responsible for a part of their education is often a good lesson in work ethic, even if you can afford to pay for everything, and a critical life lesson if you can’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep Spending and Debt under Control</strong>. When you have an adorable child it’s very easy to overspend. You want them to have the best of everything. Setting a budget and sticking with that can help you keep your spending in line with your established budget. This can also help you maintain the discipline needed to continue contributions to long-term financial goals like retirement and their college education. And remember, the best gift you can give your children – your time and attention – is free.</p>\n<p>Another important consideration is debt. When you carry debt, you are paying today for yesterday’s bills. Investing potentially allows you to pay today for tomorrow’s bills. By keeping yesterday’s bills settled and debt to a minimum, you lay the foundations for having enough to enjoy today with your children and plan for tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Teach Children About Finances At An Early Age</strong>. Finances are a part of our daily lives. When you involve children early on they gain an appreciation for what things cost and how to choose what we want and what we can live without. As soon as your child old enough, start helping save their pennies for something they really want, and teach them that work is part of the process of earning money. These skills, if taught early, can lead to a lifetime of responsible money management.</p>\n<p>Parenting is an amazing adventure that changes the way you see yourself and the world. Keeping an eye on finances can provide you with the confidence you need to not only enjoy your growing family but help lay the foundations for a stronger future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>¹ <a href=\"http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064\">http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064</a></p>\n<p>LFS-1219374-060815</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5151515151515151,"src":"/static/27254aa54df9da8e8ce05dbd9605b1bb/da113/7parentingtips1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/27254aa54df9da8e8ce05dbd9605b1bb/3f132/7parentingtips1-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/27254aa54df9da8e8ce05dbd9605b1bb/8850c/7parentingtips1-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/27254aa54df9da8e8ce05dbd9605b1bb/da113/7parentingtips1-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/27254aa54df9da8e8ce05dbd9605b1bb/7223d/7parentingtips1-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/27254aa54df9da8e8ce05dbd9605b1bb/f2cbb/7parentingtips1-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/27254aa54df9da8e8ce05dbd9605b1bb/4463e/7parentingtips1-1.jpg 851w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"bbc7cef7-5116-58f8-a5b3-e2a2fb768048","slug":"four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement","title":"Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement","content":"<p>While retirement may seem a long way off when you’re young and just starting to build a business – or older and rebooting &#8211; it’s important to have a retirement savings plan and stick to it to create the future you want.</p>\n<p>Retirement planning can be difficult for anyone, but entrepreneurs and small business owners can face unique challenges. According to a 2013 American Express survey, <strong>60 percent</strong> of small business owners said they weren’t saving enough for retirement, and over <strong>73 percent</strong> said they were worried about not being able to afford the lifestyle they want in retirement.</p>\n<p>While many employees can choose to make automatic deductions from their paycheck towards a 401k, for instance, entrepreneurs have to make a conscious decision to sock away money for retirement, as well as find plans that work for them.</p>\n<p>Fortunately there are several things that you can begin doing now to contributing to your long-term financial future. As always, please review these and other options with your financial planner to see what strategy may be most suitable for your individual situation.</p>\n<h3><strong>1) Open an IRA</strong></h3>\n<p>If you haven’t already, now may be as good a time as any to open an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). IRAs are long term investments that allow you to save money for the future in a tax efficient way. They also offer catch up contributions if you’re over 50.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Traditional vs. Roth</em></strong></p>\n<p>Traditional IRAs allow you to deduct contributions the year in which they are made, then pay taxes when you withdraw the money. A Roth IRA allows you to pay taxes on your contributions now, rather than upon withdrawal and earnings and distributions may not be taxable if held in the Roth IRA for up to 5 years.</p>\n<p>For older investors who are approaching retirement, traditional IRAs probably make more sense, as their tax rate may likely be lower in retirement than it is currently. Younger investors, however, may want to consider a Roth IRA if they believe their tax rate could be higher in the future than when they make their contributions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Contribution Limitations</em></strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of whether you elect to contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA the IRS sets annual limits each year stating the maximum individuals can contribute to their IRA based on their annual earnings. For instance, in 2015 you are limited to a maximum of <strong>$5,500</strong> annually (or <strong>$6,500</strong> if you are 50 or over).</p>\n<p>Finally, with either type of IRA, there are penalties and taxes for early withdrawals prior to 59 ½ years old!</p>\n<p>Please consult your tax professional regarding your specific situation and the specific rules that apply to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2) Consider alternative forms of IRAs to increase your contribution limits</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are your company’s only employee, or you only have a couple of other employees, you may want to look into setting up either an<strong> SEP-IRA or a SIMPLE-IRA.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>SEP-IRA</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SEP-IRAs</strong> allow you to contribute up to 25% of your salary, or $53,000 (as of 2015) whichever is smaller. This is significantly more than what non-SEP-IRAs allow for.</p>\n<p>Setting up a <strong>SEP-IRA</strong> may be an easy choice if you and your spouse are your only employees, but there can be other costs associated if you have other people working for you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>SIMPLE-IRAs</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SIMPLE-IRAs</strong> provide an alternative that is cheaper for companies with several employees.</p>\n<p>With the <strong>SIMPLE-IRA,</strong> the employer creates an IRA for each employee. Employees have the option to contribute a certain percentage of their income to their IRA. Employers are then required to match that percentage up to a maximum of three percent of the person’s salary, or contribute two percent of each person’s salary into the IRA.</p>\n<p>By creating a <strong>SIMPLE-IRA</strong> the owner is then able to contribute an additional $12,500 ($15,500 for those 50 and over) to his or her own IRA.</p>\n<p>If you have only a few employees working for you and you expect to contribute either the full $12,500 or a large portion of it, there is a good chance that your tax savings may more than pay for the cost of contributing to your employee’s IRAs. Please consult your tax professional for more specific information about how this could affect you and your employees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3) Setup Automatic Deductions</strong></h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, we all have a tendency to procrastinate, and thinking about retirement is often not at the top of our priorities! It’s easy for entrepreneurs and small business owners in particular to become distracted and forget to contribute to your retirement account(s). Automatic deductions solve this problem.</p>\n<p>By setting up your IRA and other retirement accounts to take money directly out of your bank account or paycheck each week (or month,) you can ensure that you contribute as much money as you feel you can, up to the full tax deductible amount, each year. You no longer have to worry about forgetting to, or putting off, contributing.</p>\n<p>With any IRA, think carefully about how much you can realistically contribute. They are considered long term investments and you cannot access the money prior to a specific age without incurring taxes and significant penalties for making early withdrawals. Please make sure you are carefully considering your short and medium term goals. And remember: starting to save early is a good way to get on the road to achieving your goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4) Speak with as Experienced Financial Planner to Help You Create a Plan</strong></h3>\n<p>Taking care of long-term financial goals can be a challenge but fortunately you don’t have to go it alone.

Whether there’s a hot new sector that seems to be on fire, or a classic U.S. company that seems poised for a new burst of life, or, worse, a pundit who keeps warning us not to get caught flat-footed.</p>\n<p>It’s human nature to be attracted to the next shiny new thing. My 2-year old son was perfectly happy playing with his trusty push truck, for instance, until he got a shiny red Matchbox car for his birthday and abandoned the – still very serviceable &#8211; truck.</p>\n<p>It’s also human nature to try to catch winners on the way up and want to abandon the underperformers. But that doesn’t mean it’s always a good idea.</p>\n<p>While the market as a whole has done quite well over the last 20 years &#8211; the S&amp;P 500 has returned approximately 9.9%, and a diversified portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds would have returned 8.7% [1]<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a>– the same can’t be said for the average investor.</p>\n<p>During the 10 year period from 2003- 2013, the average investor’s portfolio only returned 2.6% annually, [2] barely a quarter of what the S&amp;P returned, and not much higher than the rate of inflation.</p>\n<p>What’s the reason for this underperformance?</p>\n<p>By trying to beat the market by chasing performance, by trying to time markets, and by overpaying in fees, investors hurt their returns significantly.</p>\n<h3>Chasing Returns</h3>\n<p>When a particular investment is performing well, investors often get excited and invest more, causing the price to continue to climb. As it does, more investors are attracted to its returns &#8211; even as the stock becomes more expensive &#8211; causing the price to rise even more.</p>\n<p>Eventually however the investment will return to its intrinsic value, and fluctuate slightly around that number.</p>\n<p>When that happens, the investors who tried to chase performance and bought on the more expensive upswing, will lose money or underperform the market.</p>\n<h3>Timing the Market</h3>\n<p>It is not surprising that investors try to time the market. If we were able to predict when markets would top and when they would bottom, we’d all be enjoying extraordinary returns. In reality, however, very few people who try to time the markets actually succeed.</p>\n<p>According to Morningstar, market timing costs the average investor 1.5% annually. For a hypothetical portfolio that returned 8.7% annually, a 1.5% additional ‘expense’ ends up eating up over 17% of the investor’s returns.</p>\n<p>Warren Buffet once said, “the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good.” Famed investor Peter Lynch said, “Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves”. [3]</p>\n<p>If Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch don’t believe in trying to time the market, and studies have shown that strategies that try to time the market have very low success rates, it’s a good sign that you’re probably better off not trying too.</p>\n<h3>Overpaying Fees</h3>\n<p>If you are chasing returns, and trying to time the market, chances are you are making more trades than you would with a buy-and-hold strategy. That means you are paying more fees, which also affects your overall rate of return negatively.</p>\n<h3>A Potential Solution</h3>\n<p>The smarter approach may be to <strong>do less</strong>. Investors have historically hurt their returns by over-trading. Looking at your portfolio too often or constantly checking up on how the markets are doing can be detrimental to your finances if you are prone to reacting too impulsively. Rather than trying to time the market, or always buying the next hot stock or asset class, investors tend to have more success by taking a hands off approach.</p>\n<p>Yes, his red Matchbox car is shiny and bright. But, as my son grows up, I hope he’ll learn to value the tried and true as well. And smart investors do the same, thinking carefully before they leap into the next big thing, or try to catch the current wave and ride it to the top.</p>\n<p>Sometimes doing less is doing more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor to determine if your current portfolio and your current strategy are appropriate for your individual investment needs.</p>\n<p>1) https://www.jpmorganfunds.com/blobcontentheader/202/900/1158474868049_jp-littlebook.pdf  (page 65)</p>\n<p>2) http://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2014/04/24/why-the-average-investors-investment-return-is-so-low/</p>\n<p>3) http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/your-money/forget-market-timing-and-stick-to-a-balanced-fund.html?_r=0</p>\n<p>LFS-1189812-050415</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9607843137254901,"src":"/static/8868f3e3a6019d7d85bae5f002e052ab/da113/image1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8868f3e3a6019d7d85bae5f002e052ab/3f132/image1-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/8868f3e3a6019d7d85bae5f002e052ab/8850c/image1-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/8868f3e3a6019d7d85bae5f002e052ab/da113/image1-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/8868f3e3a6019d7d85bae5f002e052ab/7223d/image1-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/8868f3e3a6019d7d85bae5f002e052ab/f2cbb/image1-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/8868f3e3a6019d7d85bae5f002e052ab/13082/image1-1.jpg 920w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"bd541f6b-59c5-557a-9d6e-06cf1b8f6ced","slug":"10-things-to-discuss-before-marriage","title":"10 Important Things To Discuss Before Marriage","content":"<h3>10 Things to Discuss Before the Big Day</h3>\n<p>You are excited, in love, and planning the wedding of your dreams.

This is a time when procrastination could cost you a bundle, even if neither one of you currently have a lot of assets.</p>\n<p>Getting married is more than just substituting the word <strong>“ours”</strong> for <strong>“yours”</strong> and <strong>“mine”</strong>.  It&#8217;s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions &#8211; even your music &#8211; and making all of that <strong>“ours</strong><strong>”</strong> too.

Our family’s views on money can have a big impact on the way we see finances. In some families money may not be talked about. In others, one partner may hide money or spending from the other. While we might not consciously have these same behaviors, our upbringing will have an impact on how we feel about money and how we save, spend, and budget.</p>\n<p>The best way to address unconscious &#8211; and sometimes conflicting &#8211; money behaviors is to start by recognizing how you each feel about money. Then you can take a practical approach and implement the best strategies from the past and incorporate them into your new relationship. This will also give you a chance to address any not-so-beneficial attitudes and behaviors and work to consciously change them.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Spending/Saving Habits</strong>. Chances are the two of you don&#8217;t spend and save money the same way. The interesting thing about spending and saving habits is that they give insight into priorities, both financial and otherwise because we tend to spend money on things we feel are most important and scoff at spending on things we see as unimportant.  Some people value saving more than anything and could be considered “tightwads”. Other people have a “live for today” attitude and spend whatever they have available, saving nothing or little for later. Most of us find ourselves somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p>Not agreeing on spending priorities can lead to serious conflicts down the line. While there is no right and wrong answer regarding priorities and habits, it&#8217;s valuable to know and understand each other’s habits earlier rather than later.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Divvying Up the Bills.</strong> This is an important conversation about how you will manage your money together. Will you have separate or joint accounts? Who will be responsible for paying the bills and investing for long term goals? A realistic understanding both of your current incomes and current debts is important so you can create a realistic budget based on your combined income and expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Credit History.</strong> No one likes to talk about credit ratings because they highlight past mistakes and spending habits. Yet it&#8217;s essential to know and discuss your credit histories. This can help you talk about past money mistakes, current debt loads, and how to address any issues that are lurking. Having this conversation now will also help if you&#8217;re planning to borrow money for a large purchase, such as a home or car; credit history will effect how much you&#8217;ll pay in interest for loans, as well as how much it will cost for things like insurance. Many companies even pull credit for potential job applicants. When it comes to credit, it&#8217;s best not to have surprises down the road, so have the conversation now.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Risk Tolerance and Financial Goals.</strong> Couples often have very strong &#8211; and differing &#8211; feelings about risk and money that are deeply rooted in past experiences.  Your family may have gone through periods of unemployment, for instance, or  you may have grown up taking financial security for granted. One of your parents may have owned a business and you saw it go bankrupt,  so you might be very conservative with your money and not want to take unnecessary chances. Or perhaps they invested in a business that was a huge success.</p>\n<p>Everyone brings a different level of comfort when it comes to risk tolerance and it&#8217;s important to understand your partner&#8217;s because it has an impact on spending and savings habits &#8211; everything from where you invest to how much money you want to set aside. Money provides a level of security that can be very powerful and risk tolerance is directly linked to that feeling of security.</p>\n<p><strong> 6) Ongoing Financial Obligations.</strong> If this is a second marriage, are there child support or alimony payments that need to be considered in the budget process? If so, how much and how long will the obligations need to be fulfilled. Caring for elderly parents might also be a long term expense you will be facing as a couple.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Net Worth.</strong> When it&#8217;s a first marriage, often neither partner has much in the way of assets, but if one partner has more than the other, are you going to want a pre-nuptial agreement? When discussing net worth it is valuable to discuss not only current net worth, but also aspiring net worth. What household income level are you both hoping to achieve. Will reaching those aspirations include additional education? Will it mean switching jobs several times early in your career? Will it mean working 80 hours a week for decades? As a couple, understanding financial expectations and future net worth aspirations will help you plan a life together that will meet both of your needs, financially and emotionally.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Family Plans.</strong> The family size you hope to have will also have a big impact on your financial needs. Children, as wonderful as they are, are very expensive to raise. Do you both want to have children and, if so, one child or several children? Discussions about how the children will be raised and educated are also valuable from a financial perspective. Will one of you stay home to raise the children? Will you pay for day care? How far apart should the children be? Each of these answers will have a significant financial impact to the family budget.</p>\n<p><strong> 9) Combining Physical and Financial Assets.</strong> Particularly with couples getting married later, both partners will have accumulated possessions that now need to be combined. This can be as simple as which sofa and bedroom set to keep, or more complicated when multiple homes, retirement accounts, and other investments are brought into the mix. Discussing whether property, accounts, and debt should be left in individual names or held jointly is also an important conversation to have.</p>\n<p><strong>10) Wills, Trusts, and Life Insurance.</strong> When you&#8217;re getting married, you don’t really want to think about death. Yet wills, trusts, and life insurance need to be updated soon after you say, <strong>“I Do.”</strong> This is true especially if you have assets or children. The process of obtaining a will or trust is fairly straightforward; it’s the discussions that lead up to it that provide the most value. Both of you should have a good understanding of what you have and what you want to happen, should the unthinkable occur.</p>\n<p>Financial advisors can be a real asset, when it comes to pre-marital financial discussions. They can help you determine when it is best to hold assets jointly or separately. Assistance with budgeting and planning for long term goals will help you create a strong financial plan. Advisors can also guide you in building a strategy for reaching financial milestones.</p>\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re getting married (or just got married), <strong>congratulations</strong>! And while these discussions may not be the most romantic ones you&#8217;re having, they do have the ability to bring you closer together. Planning together and sharing your dreams will give you better insight into the mind and heart of the person you&#8217;ve fallen in love with and allow you to become stronger partners when it comes to reaching your goals as a couple, emotional as well as financial.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Being able to juggle several balls in the air and multi-task is par for the course for this generation. So why do Millennials often struggle with how to prioritize between saving for the future and paying down debt?</p>\n<p>Many Millennials still have college loans to pay off or have acquired credit card debt while taking home minimal starting salaries. And advice about how to get started is confusing: some financial professionals recommend having at least one month of income saved prior to starting to pay down your debt, while others recommend up to 8 months of savings. That&#8217;s a daunting prospect when you&#8217;re young and living from paycheck to paycheck!</p>\n<p>Because of the power of compounding interest, the 20s and 30s are your prime savings years. Not taking advantage of the opportunity to save now may end up costing you later. So how can you start to build your savings <em>and</em> pay down debt, while still maintaining a reasonable quality of life?</p>\n<p>The good news is that &#8211; because they&#8217;re used to a struggling economy &#8211; Millennials have become very resourceful when it comes to finances. Here are several factors to consider when you&#8217;re deciding how much you can &#8211; or even if you can &#8211; allocate for both.</p>\n<h3>Three Questions to consider about saving vs. debt:</h3>\n<p><strong>What is my monthly incoming &amp; outgoing cash flow? </strong>Hopefully it&#8217;s not negative! If it is, though, try to find daily and household expenses that can be trimmed or eliminated (that venti caramel latte? An expensive cable package?) If it&#8217;s positive, determine if there&#8217;s enough left over to pay credit card minimums while allocating a portion, however small, toward a saving plan.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the interest rate on my debt?</strong> Debt with an interest rate of higher than 5% is a priority to pay down, otherwise you&#8217;re spending your hard-earned cash on borrowing costs. Can you roll over your debt to a lower-interest or zero-interest credit card? If not, create an action plan to pay off high-interest debt first. If you have debt with interest rates that are lower than<strong> 5%</strong>, consider contributing to a <strong>401K</strong> or a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. The same way interest compounds with your debts, it also grows with your savings, so the sooner you take action, the more you will gain over time.</p>\n<p><strong>What is my stress level regarding debt?</strong> If the stress of having debt is overwhelming, then make paying the debt before contributing to your savings a priority. If your debt seems manageable, start getting in the habit of making monthly contributions to a savings plan.</p>\n<p>Remember, no two people, and no two financial plans, are alike. Whether you can contribute to a savings plan and pay down debt simultaneously depends on you and your unique situation. Talking to a financial advisor can help put you on a path that is right for you. The important thing is to create a goal and a plan!</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-budgeting-and-saving/\">Budgeting and Savings planning</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\">What’s your Credit Score?</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brad Sherman is a financial planner who is committed to helping individuals and families achieve financial independence and gain confidence with regard to financial issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Call or contact him today to see if his services are a good fit for your needs.</span></p>\n<p id=\":r0\" class=\"hP\" tabindex=\"-1\">LFS-989662-081314</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5873015873015872,"src":"/static/24f49264634b555f5d28a5e4929887f0/da113/Pay-Down-Debt-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/24f49264634b555f5d28a5e4929887f0/3f132/Pay-Down-Debt-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/24f49264634b555f5d28a5e4929887f0/8850c/Pay-Down-Debt-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/24f49264634b555f5d28a5e4929887f0/da113/Pay-Down-Debt-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/24f49264634b555f5d28a5e4929887f0/7223d/Pay-Down-Debt-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/24f49264634b555f5d28a5e4929887f0/f2cbb/Pay-Down-Debt-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/24f49264634b555f5d28a5e4929887f0/21cdb/Pay-Down-Debt-1.jpg 961w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c1ebfda2-6cce-51cd-9e9a-046ba3e552ba","slug":"tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market","title":"Navigating the Stock Market: Tips for Millennials","content":"<p>Navigating the stock market can be daunting for anyone, especially if you&#8217;re new to investing.</p>\n<p>Between struggling to pay off student loans, finding jobs in a difficult market, and setting goals for financial independence in a stressed market environment, it&#8217;s been a daunting few years in general for many Millennials, who may have put off investing because they just don&#8217;t feel comfortable or ready.</p>\n<p>Feeling comfortable with investing &#8211; and understanding how the stock market works &#8211; is critical, however, as you start gaining independence and start making important financial decisions.

Whether you&#8217;re investing in a retirement savings plans or a regular investment account, it&#8217;s important to start early so that your investments compound. Remember, even small amounts add up over time!</p>\n<p>● <b>Create a plan and stick with it:</b> There are many ways to be successful and no one strategy is inherently better than any other. Once you find your style, stick with it. Bouncing in and out of the market makes is just as likely you will miss some of the best days and hit the worst.  Readjust your portfolio when necessary, but not too often.</p>\n<p>● <b>Think long term and be disciplined:</b> Be prepared to buy and hold your positions. Big short-term profits can be enticing when you&#8217;re new to the market but short-term wins will get you off track. Start a program, stay invested, and don’t be too concerned with day-to-day profits and losses.  Warren Buffet once asked, “Suppose you’re going to be investing for the next several years. Do you want the price of the stocks to go up or down?&#8221; While everybody assumes it&#8217;s &#8220;up,&#8221; in reality, it’s only people who are withdrawing in the near future who really want stocks to go up!</p>\n<p>● <b>Do your research:</b> Always be an informed investor. Do your own due diligence with companies you&#8217;re interested in. Don’t go for a ‘hot tip’ just because there&#8217;s a lot of buzz; research companies, get advice, and decide if they&#8217;re investments that are right for you.</p>\n<p>● <b>Never let your emotions influence you:</b> The markets move in cycles. When the markets are up, we feel elated about our investment decisions. When markets start to move down, we may experience anxiety and panic. Reacting emotionally can lead to spur of the moment decisions that don&#8217;t benefit you in the long run. Again: think long term.</p>\n<p>● <b>Always have a margin of safety:</b> The first rule anyone new to investing needs to learn is that there are no guarantees in the stock market. An investment that looks great on paper does not always pan out in real life.  Know how much risk you are willing to take and make sure your investments are aligned with your risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>● <b>Diversify:</b> Never put all your eggs in one kind of basket. It&#8217;s important to make sure your portfolio includes both stocks and yield-producing assets, such as bonds, to cushion you against market volatility. Diversification doesn&#8217;t just mean investing in multiple companies either; investigate ways to invest in different markets, bother national and international, as well.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">One final tip: find an experienced financial planner you trust, who &#8220;gets&#8221; you, your goals, and your timeline, and who can guide you as you invest in your future.</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brad Sherman is a financial planner who is committed to helping individuals and families achieve financial independence and gain confidence with regard to financial issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Call or contact him today to see if his services are a good fit for your needs.</span></p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dollar-cost-averaging/\">What is Dollar Cost Averaging?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-things-investors-get-wrong/\">5 Things Investors Get Wrong</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont/\">5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p id=\":4pl\" class=\"hP\" tabindex=\"-1\">LFS-996518-082214</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.492537313432836,"src":"/static/04a791bcec9140ec8bc84ddbc2276a91/da113/Understanding-the-Stockmarket-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/04a791bcec9140ec8bc84ddbc2276a91/3f132/Understanding-the-Stockmarket-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/04a791bcec9140ec8bc84ddbc2276a91/8850c/Understanding-the-Stockmarket-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/04a791bcec9140ec8bc84ddbc2276a91/da113/Understanding-the-Stockmarket-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/04a791bcec9140ec8bc84ddbc2276a91/7223d/Understanding-the-Stockmarket-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/04a791bcec9140ec8bc84ddbc2276a91/aaf19/Understanding-the-Stockmarket-1.jpg 735w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"b0db9768-3502-5a0b-846f-f28867af8063","slug":"discussing-finances-critical-difficult-many","title":"Discussing Personal Finance is Difficult for Many &#8211; but Critical","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Money can be a difficult subject for any of us to talk about, although it seems to be particularly challenging, statistically, for women. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/most-women-feel-more-comfortable-talking-to-a-doctor-than-to-a-financial-adviser-2015-2\">a recent study released by Fidelity</a>, 80% of women surveyed said that they had refrained from discussing financial issues with friends or family, despite the fact that over 92% of those surveyed expressed an interest in learning more about financial planning. Among those surveyed, some of the most common reasons given were that money was too personal a topic, it felt uncomfortable to talk about, or it was considered &#8220;taboo.&#8221; Additionally, women are also more likely to feel that they don’t know enough about the subject to speak about it intelligently. This is despite the fact that <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/women-make-investors/story?id=15039090\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">studies have shown that women tend to be better investors than men.</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Money is, however, a critical subject that we all need to discuss &#8211; and discuss often &#8211; in relationships. A little while ago I wrote about the </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/7-things-married-couples-discuss-today/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">7 Things Married Couples Should Discuss Today</span></a><span class=\"s1\">, where I talked about why it is critical that married couples go over their finances together. Marriage is not, however, the only relationship that requires having difficult conversations about money. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to communicate with our parents and children about money, and even friends, coworkers and extended family members in some cases.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With money playing such an important role in our daily lives, it&#8217;s critical that we learn to overcome our desire to avoid the topic and learn how to effectively and confidently communicate about financial matters. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fortunately there are a few things you can do to make the topic of money easier to discuss:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. Realize that difficult conversations are sometimes necessary</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether you need to confront your parents about their retirement plans, your spouse about where to allocate investments, or your children about their spending habits money can be a difficult topic to talk about. By reminding yourself that these are conversations that you will ultimately need to have however you are setting yourself up for success.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. Find someone knowledgeable about finances who you can trust</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No one has all the answers when it comes to money, which is why it is often helpful to turn to others for ideas and suggestions. You should find someone &#8211; whether it’s a friend, family member or a financial advisor &#8211; who is knowledgeable, who you know has your best interests at heart, and with whom you feel comfortable speaking.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will give you the opportunity to ask questions, bounce around ideas, and learn and grow. It will also give you the confidence to discuss finances with others.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. Get educated</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the best ways to feel comfortable discussing money with others is by learning as much about the subject as you can. Read books, ask questions, and get help when needed. By learning as much as you can, you feel more comfortable giving advice, making financial decisions and having what would otherwise be difficult conversations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. Don’t procrastinate when discussing finances</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If there is a money-related conversation that you have been putting off, bring it up now or at the next time possible. Don’t wait!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">H</span><span class=\"s2\">ere</span><span class=\"s1\"> are a few more suggestions for important conversation starters:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your spouse:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Family’s budget</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Retirement savings</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Saving for children’s college fund</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Where to invest money</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your children:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allowance</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Spending</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Basic financial principles</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your parents:<br />\n</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Their retirement plans</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Location of legal documents including wills, trusts and insurance paperwork</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;re like most people, chances are there are many other subjects that you need to discuss with those you&#8217;re close to. It may be a good idea to contact a financial advisor to help you with these as well as other issues revolving around money.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brad Sherman is a financial planner in Gaithersburg, Maryland who is committed to helping individuals and families achieve financial independence and gain confidence with regard to financial issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Call him today to see if his services are a good fit for your needs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LFS-1140071-030415 </strong></span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9607843137254901,"src":"/static/0c43c89717dd9a0e3d9ed52090f47c07/da113/Discussing-Finances-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0c43c89717dd9a0e3d9ed52090f47c07/3f132/Discussing-Finances-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/0c43c89717dd9a0e3d9ed52090f47c07/8850c/Discussing-Finances-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/0c43c89717dd9a0e3d9ed52090f47c07/da113/Discussing-Finances-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/0c43c89717dd9a0e3d9ed52090f47c07/7223d/Discussing-Finances-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/0c43c89717dd9a0e3d9ed52090f47c07/f2cbb/Discussing-Finances-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/0c43c89717dd9a0e3d9ed52090f47c07/e9634/Discussing-Finances-1.jpg 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"234fb635-d0af-5a4e-8e4b-b0eabd8efc26","slug":"financial-planning-for-millennials","title":"Financial Planning for Millennials: Overcoming the Fear Factor","content":"<p>What do you think of when you think of Millennials? The media loves to paint Millennials as “<strong>adventurous</strong>”, “<strong>risk takers</strong>,” and “<strong>thrill seekers</strong>.” But, surprisingly, when it comes to financial planning for Millennials, their behavior is <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/millennials-fiscally-conservative/\">anything but risky</a>.</p>\n<p>In fact, there is evidence that, while emotions and biases play a large part in Millennials&#8217; investment decisions,  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fear-keeps-millennials-investing-sidelines/\"><strong>fear</strong> leads the list of behavioral influences</a>.</p>\n<p>We Millennials grew up during the Internet crash and have witnessed one of the most turbulent market cycles in recent U.S. history. With the financial crisis of 2008, and the housing bust leading to a recession, many of us have watched our parents struggle with financial security and worry about whether they&#8217;ll ever be able to retire. Many recent grads have experienced unemployment as a result of the crisis, and many are burdened with significant student loan debt. Good times? Not.</p>\n<p>These experiences during their impressionable years have led many Millennials to take an emotionally driven approach to Financial Planning for Millennials and to adopt conservative money habits that analysts have compared to the investment behavior of young adults during the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>They tend to be wary of investing in equities, for instance, resorting to a behavioral bias that favors peer narratives and unscientific anecdotes – such as stories of retirement-age people whose nest eggs were destroyed by the financial crisis &#8211; over careful data analysis.</p>\n<p>In May 2013, Wells Fargo released the results of a study surveying more than 1,400 Millennials, that found that Millennials <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/millennials-time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-stock-market/\">view the stock market</a>, and most investments, as a risk not worth taking. More than half of Millennials are “<strong>not very confident</strong>” or “<strong>not at all confident</strong>” about the stock market and many of the Millennials who do consider investing in stocks see the market as a short-term investment. The survey also found that Millennials&#8217; primary concerns were student loan debt and paying their monthly bills.</p>\n<p>In fact, Millennials have not only taken on more student loan debt than any previous generation but they continue to struggle in a challenging job market. With many Millennials remaining unemployed or underemployed, and with bills and debt as their top priorities, they have very little disposable income for investing. Many, according to a Pew Research poll released in October 2013, did not even begin thinking about saving or establishing a 401(k) until about five years into their careers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a UBS Wealth Management survey report featured on <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com\">Bankrate.com</a> found that, more 39% of the Millennials surveyed &#8211; more than any other age group &#8211; said that cash is their preferred way to invest money that they don&#8217;t need for at least ten years. That&#8217;s three times the number who chose to invest in the stock market, despite the fact that the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> has gained 17% over the past year while most cash investment yields remain below 1%.</p>\n<h3>The Danger of Playing it Safe</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The problem with short-term stock investment approaches and dipping in and out of the stock market is that it can work against investors, because short-term investments may be subject to a higher rate of <strong>volatility</strong>. Instead of looking at the long-term data, which shows that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">stocks typically outperform</a> other more conservative asset classes over the long run, those young investors are fearful of the short-range volatility, clouding data about the positive potential of long-term investing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">That reluctance to get into the market can be <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/generation-long-term-financial-goals/\">problematic for long-term portfolio</a> growth because, without the returns from stocks, it can be difficult to reach savings and retirement goals.</span></p>\n<h3>Bigger is Not Always Better…When Finding a Financial Advisor</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">With the crash of the big banks and the negative publicity surrounding Wall Street financial firms, Millennials became a generation that looked at financial professionals with mistrust. Instead, they rely more heavily on the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\"><strong>Internet</strong>, <strong>social media</strong>, and <strong>personal networks</strong> for financial advice</a>. Their experience with market volatility and lack of job security has had a significant impact on their attitudes and behaviors toward investing. With very little disposable income after bills and debt payment, Millennials want to feel a sense of security with their investments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">When it comes to working with a financial professional, ‘old school’, traditional banking services are of no interest to them. Bigger is not better in their minds; a <strong>smaller, more independent financial planning firm</strong> may be able to offer a more hands-on and collaborative approach to investing that Millennials feel more comfortable with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">It’s important to Millennials that they find <strong>someone they can trust</strong> and who can relate to their concerns and be open to new ideas and methods of investing. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Sherman Wealth Management </a>understands that being a part of the investing process is a must in financial planning for Millennials. We fill a role for clients who can no longer relate to, or trust, the large financial institutions that once held a stronghold in the marketplace. The professionals at Sherman Wealth Management provide a personalized plan for investing and help our clients navigate through the difficulty of prioritizing financial obligations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Remember how it was the overconfidence of the large financial firms and irresponsible investors that brought us the financial crisis in the first place? That Millennial reluctance to let history blindly repeat itself may turn out to be a pretty good thing after all!</span></p>\n<h3>Learn more about Financial Planning for Millennials and our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\">Financial Planning services.</a></h3>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-planning-tips-new-parents/\">5 Planning Tips for New Parents</a></p>\n<p>LFS-1143605-030915</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5151515151515151,"src":"/static/18e6267d2a7c93bb2d49c55e8cfb6400/da113/Overcoming-Fear-Factors-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/18e6267d2a7c93bb2d49c55e8cfb6400/3f132/Overcoming-Fear-Factors-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/18e6267d2a7c93bb2d49c55e8cfb6400/8850c/Overcoming-Fear-Factors-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/18e6267d2a7c93bb2d49c55e8cfb6400/da113/Overcoming-Fear-Factors-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/18e6267d2a7c93bb2d49c55e8cfb6400/7223d/Overcoming-Fear-Factors-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/18e6267d2a7c93bb2d49c55e8cfb6400/e163f/Overcoming-Fear-Factors-1.jpg 740w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"07cfa30a-c03c-54d5-af71-f7eb2738b7e2","slug":"reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend","title":"Why Reducing Your Tax Refund is a Good Thing","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Day\">tax day</a> fast approaching, many people are counting on receiving a big check back from the Government. While you&#8217;re probably looking forward to this windfall, there are reasons why you may wish to minimize your end-of-year refund.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why Big Refunds are Bad</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taxes are refunded to you when the Government takes too much of your pay each pay period. By overpaying each paycheck, only to get the money returned to you once a year, you are essentially lending the Government money at zero percent interest. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is money that could have been budgeted for and spent, or invested, throughout the year. Even if you had put the money in a savings account over the year, you still would be better off.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How to Minimize Your Refund</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to adjust the amount that is withheld for the IRS each pay period you need to fill out/change your W-4 form.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The W-4 allows you to specify allowances or exemptions that you are eligible for.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">These can include:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Donations to charitable organizations</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interest on a home mortgage</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interest on student loan debt</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Contributions to traditional IRAs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The W-4 form estimates the amount that you would receive from a tax refund. This amount is then distributed over the number of weeks remaining in the tax year, lowering the amount withheld from your paycheck each pay period.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You should also look into filling out a new W-4 every time you have experienced a major change in your life. Examples of this include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Switching jobs</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marriage</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Having a child</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Losing a dependent (They either file their own tax return, or you can no longer claim them)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While trying to lower the amount that is withheld in taxes each pay period generally makes sense, it may be prudent to not list all of the exemptions you are eligible for on your W-4.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why You May Not Want to Claim all Your Allowances</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While having too much in taxes withheld can be compared to lending the Government money at a rate of zero percent interest, the reverse is also true. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you underpay in taxes each paycheck, you end up owing money to the Government. In theory this is great. You could put the money in a savings account, and then at the end of the year pay back the Government while pocketing the interest that you collected. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In practice however this is not a prudent strategy for most people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Individuals have a tendency to spend money that they have, and forget about longer-term consequences of their actions. Additionally while receiving a refund at the end of the year is exciting, the opposite is also true.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is why it may make sense for you to leave a few deductions you are eligible for unlisted on your W-4. This ensures that you receive a tax refund, albeit a smaller one, rather than owing money.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What to Do When You Do Receive a Refund</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While this advice can be helpful for next year, chances are this year’s tax season will provide you with a large refund.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you do receive a large refund there are a series of things you can consider to maximize its value. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Invest in yourself – Sometimes the best investment you can make is in yourself. Consider buying a book or taking a class to help improve your performance in work or at life.</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Get your will done – this can often cost less than a $1,000 in total but can save your beneficiary’s significantly more both in terms of money as well as headache</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Put money into a college savings plan </span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay down your mortgage</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Invest in a non-tax-exempt account – if you have already maxed out your IRA</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Save for a rainy day</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Open/add to an IRA</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay off student loan debt</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay off credit card debt – if you have any credit card debt, this should be an immediate priority</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Save the money and increase your 401(k) contributions – put your money in a safe place such as a savings account, and bump up your 401(k) contributions to reflect the fact that you have this money sitting on the side.</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of what you do with your tax refund, it is important that you come up with a plan. A trusted financial planner can help you in the process of creating one.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With over a decade’s worth of experience in the financial services industry <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Brad Sherman</a> is committed to helping individual investors plan and prepare for retirement.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Having grown up with social media and the internet, this generation is not as private as their parents and grandparents are, especially about subjects like money and finance. The advantage is that open conversations can reduce fears and increase understanding, which can result in better decision making.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yet, with all this comfort in discussing financial matters, many <strong>Millennials</strong> are hesitant to meet with a financial advisor. It&#8217;s one thing to gather information from family and friends or read articles about investing, it&#8217;s another to discuss your personal information with a financial advisor. That&#8217;s when it moves from theoretical to personal and that can create a great deal of fear and discomfort.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why Fear Gets the Best of Us</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How Much Do You Really Know About Finances</b><strong>?</strong> As educated professionals, it&#8217;s common to feel like you should know everything. After all, if you don’t understand it, a few internet searches should provide the answers! </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When it comes to money matters, though, many Millennials feel like a fish out of water. Internet searches can provide information that&#8217;s both confusing and conflicting, and that doesn&#8217;t answer individual questions about strategy and direction. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then there is the question of what information can be trusted. Is the site legitimate and can the writer&#8217;s &#8211; and site&#8217;s &#8211; motivation be trusted? While financial information is plentiful, much of it&#8217;s either very general or coming from a sales site that promises a secret formula that will turn you into a millionaire. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Financial decisions by nature are very individual and personal. Because there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all investing strategy, personal consultations are invaluable.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Advisor motivations</b>. Can the advisor be trusted? A trusted advisor needs to understand your circumstances, goals, dreams, and aspirations. Once they do, they can help to create a long term strategy that will help to make those dreams a reality. But you must be able to trust that your advisor will make recommendations that are most beneficial to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">you</span>, the client, not the best for them, the advisor.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Addressing these concerns in an open conversation will go a long way. No one wants to be sold a product. We all want to invest money in a sound strategy. Understanding the reasons for the recommendation will help you understand how it may benefit you and help you pursue your long term goals. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Fear of not being understood</b>. As complicated individuals we want to appear like we have everything in order. In reality, sometimes we&#8217;re confident, other times not so much. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Financial advisors have seen nearly every level of financial preparedness. They have seen financial messes and worked with clients to get things corrected. They have seen strong portfolios, weak portfolios, no portfolio, and everything in between.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if you don&#8217;t feel you have all your ducks in a row, an advisor can help. If you&#8217;ve made bad decisions in the past, they can make recommendations for corrective action. If you&#8217;ve been unable to get things in order on your own, working with a professional can be the fastest way to get on track.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Markets not doing as expected</b>. This can go two ways. If you invest conservatively and the market takes off you might end up kicking yourself for not being more aggressive. If the markets are slow and you invest aggressively you can end up wishing you&#8217;d been more conservative. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you meet with an advisor, you&#8217;re meeting with a professional who understands the investment business and who can make recommendations that are consistent with your financial goals. An advisor does not have a crystal ball; remember that long term investing is not about beating the markets, it’s about making strong financial decisions that over time will lead to increased confidence in financial matters.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pulling the Trigger</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first step is always the hardest. This is true whether you&#8217;re trying to establish a workout routine, learn a new language, start a new job, or change your investing strategy. Resisting change is natural and we are creatures of habit. However, there comes a point when, in order to grow and progress, we have to stop making excuses and get started by meeting with a financial advisor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make the appointment. Even if you don’t think you know enough, have enough money to invest, have a good enough paying job, or whatever the excuses for delays have been. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Before you meet with the advisor</b>, write down questions you have. What things have you heard and what things do you want to understand.

Be sure to reexamine your goals and your portfolio to make sure that you&#8217;re both saving enough for retirement, and that you <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">maintain a proper asset allocation</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Life Insurance</strong> – While not a pleasant topic, it&#8217;s important to discuss with your partner what will happen in the event that one of you passes prematurely. If one, or both of you, are dependent on the other person’s income, you may want to consider purchasing a term-life insurance policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Wills and Trusts</strong> – Like life insurance, wills and trusts also are important for protecting your loved ones. They&#8217;re especially critical if you have children, or a significant amount of assets. Make sure that your assets are directed in a way that&#8217;s consistent with your wishes.</li>\n<li><strong>College Funds</strong> – If you have children, or are considering having children, you definitely want to discuss a saving strategy to help pay for college tuition. Like retirement savings, a little bit now can go a long way.</li>\n<li><strong>Health Insurance</strong> – Make sure that you and your partner are both covered, and that you understand the differences &#8211; and overlaps &#8211; in  your plans. Is there any unnecessary overlap? Should you purchase more coverage to protect yourself? Or should you switch to a high-deductible plan to save money? These are questions that should be reviewed at least once annually!</li>\n<li><strong>Major Purchases</strong> – If you are planning to make a major purchase such as a home, or a new car, you&#8217;ve probably already talked with your partner about it. You may not have talked about how you&#8217;ll pay for it though! Some questions to consider: whether or not you&#8217;ll pay cash for the purchase;  if you finance it, what type of down payment you will make, and over what period of time; and if you need to cut down on expenses elsewhere to save up for the purchase.</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong> – Review your expenses each month to see where you can make changes and cut back. Consider making a budget together to make sure that you are allocating your income in the best possible way for both of you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While financial topics can be difficult to discuss, they&#8217;re an important part of a happy and successful relationship. Make sure that both you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to finances, and set short and long term goals <em>together</em> to help keep you both on track.</p>\n<p>If you need help going over your finances or coming up with a plan, it may be wise to contact a financial planner. Financial planners can help point you in the right direction, based on your own goals, and help facilitate difficult, but important, discussions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This might mean a percentage of every paycheck that is used for investing or a specific dollar amount. You might start with as little as <strong>$50</strong> a month or <strong>$50</strong> a pay period and that will begin to create a portfolio that pays for future needs.</p>\n<h3>Advantages of Dollar Cost Averaging</h3>\n<p><strong>1) Establishes a habit of investing.</strong> One of the largest benefits is you begin to pay yourself first and take care of future needs today. Establishing a habit of setting aside a little money for tomorrow will help you live within your means, have more thoughtful budgeting, and be better prepared.</p>\n<p><strong>2) The investment is built into your budget</strong>, and you learn to live on what remains. The interesting thing about money and finances is that you tend to spend what you have. If there is a little less in the account each month you will adjust spending to accommodate for what you have. Even if it does not appear that there is money for investing you might be surprised how easy it is to “find” a small amount that can be earmarked for investments. A simple thing like bringing lunch twice a week instead of eating out can result in saving over $50 a month to use for investing.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Dollar cost averaging purchases shares at a set time each month</strong> regardless of where the investment price is. This means if the price is lower you purchase more shares. If the market is higher less shares are bought. The result is a greater tolerance for market fluctuations because you gain a better understanding that the markets move every day.</p>\n<p><strong>4) No Large Sums Required to Begin.</strong> Dollar cost averaging can be started with small amounts of money. One possible strategy is to increase monthly contributions at least annually. The more you raise the contribution amount the larger and faster your investments may grow over time.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Flexibility.</strong> Monthly contribution amounts can be changed at any time. The amounts can be raised or lowered depending on life events that impact your budget. In a perfect world the contributions would always increase, but sometimes that does not match real life events. The ability to adjust contributions reduces risk and allows for greater flexibility to meet current demands.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Great long-term strategy.</strong> Building a portfolio from the ground up can be accomplished through dollar cost averaging and regular contributions. Your investment should grow over time through both additional contributions and portfolio growth. As you receive bonuses or other financial windfalls you can make additional one time contributions as your finances allow.</p>\n<p>When it comes to investing there are no short cuts. Starting early and making regular investments will help to provide financial security and accounts that will build over time. When you start early you are less tempted to take on more portfolio risk and are better able to reach long term financial goals.</p>\n<p>The future is uncertain and setting aside a little each month to pay for long term financial needs is one of the soundest ways to pursue financial security.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/customized-financial-portfolio-construction/\">Investment Management services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">Tips for Millennials to Understanding the Stock Market</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-things-investors-get-wrong/\">5 Things Investors Get Wrong</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont/\">5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">LFS-1112149-013015</span></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/ce8e6243dd06a93103076b1b1ab99508/da113/dollarcostavg-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ce8e6243dd06a93103076b1b1ab99508/3f132/dollarcostavg-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/ce8e6243dd06a93103076b1b1ab99508/8850c/dollarcostavg-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/ce8e6243dd06a93103076b1b1ab99508/da113/dollarcostavg-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/ce8e6243dd06a93103076b1b1ab99508/7223d/dollarcostavg-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/ce8e6243dd06a93103076b1b1ab99508/f6363/dollarcostavg-1.jpg 679w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"442e613b-8f85-5c63-bd80-1e7d4d434348","slug":"5-things-investors-get-wrong","title":"5 Things Investors Get Wrong","content":"<p>Humans have a tendency to behave irrationally when it comes to money. Here are the five things investors get wrong that can harm their returns.</p>\n<h3><strong>Believing They Will Beat the Market</strong></h3>\n<p>Study after study shows that investors, including professionals, continually under perform the S&amp;P.</p>\n<p>In their most recent SPIVA (<strong>S&amp;P Indices vs. Active</strong>) report, released in September, McGraw Hill Financial found that more than <strong>85%</strong> of all funds underperformed the S&amp;P 500, the index found to represent the overall market. (1).</p>\n<p>What’s scarier is the fact that individual investors do even worse. In a 20 year study conducted by Dalbar, a financial services research firm, the average investor has seen a return of just <strong>2.1%</strong> compared with the S&amp;P’s annualized return of<strong> 7.8%</strong> (2).</p>\n<p>What causes this under performance?</p>\n<p>According to Dalbar the biggest reason for this under performance by investors is due to irrational behavioral biases. These include panic selling, under-diversifying, and chasing momentum (3).</p>\n<h3><strong>Chasing Hot Stocks</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>In a study done by the University of California Berkley, as well as UC Davis, researchers found that investors are much more likely to purchase shares in companies that have recently been in the news (4), bidding the price of these stocks up.</p>\n<p>Additionally many investors make the mistake of trying to chase performance by buying investments that have already risen significantly. A 2011 study by Baird, a wealth management firm, suggests that investors generally chase short-term performance by buying funds that have risen in the short run, and selling those that have performed poorly (5).</p>\n<p>The same can be said about the market as a whole where investors tend to purchase stocks after they have seen a large rise, and subsequently sell into weakness (6).</p>\n<p>In short, investors sell low, and buy high.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ignoring Fees</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>You probably know that fees are important, what you may not realize is just how important they are.</p>\n<p>Take for example two 30-year-old investors who each contribute <strong>$5,500</strong> annually to their IRAs. They both achieve<strong> 9%</strong> annualized returns, before fees, over the next 35 years. The only difference between them is that one investor pays annual fees of <strong>.5%</strong>, while the other investor pays <strong>2.5%</strong> in total fees. Over the course of their working career, investor A will have accumulated <strong>$1,059,859.21</strong> in their account while investor B will have <strong>$682,190.80</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>This is a hypothetical illustration only and is not indicative of any particular investment or performance. Return and principal value may fluctuate, so when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than the original cost. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</em></p>\n<p>In this example, <strong>Investor B’s</strong> IRA will be worth less than <strong>65%</strong> of <strong>Investor’s A</strong> account as a result of a <strong>2%</strong> difference in fees!</p>\n<h3><strong>Not Re-balancing<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>While buy-and-hold is usually a good strategy for most people, it is sometimes necessary for individuals to make slight tweaks to their investments.</p>\n<p>This is particularly important if you have had one asset class or investment rise or fall significantly more than the rest of your portfolio. In this case it is a good idea to re balance your portfolio in order to realign it with your target allocation. This ensures that you not only maintain diversity, but also that you buy low, and sell high, by buying assets that have fallen significantly and selling assets that have risen.</p>\n<h3><strong>Turning to the Wrong People for Advice</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>Financial advice and information has never been more accessible to the average investor than it is today. Between TV and the Internet, investors are bombarded with information on a daily basis.

In a world where jobs are constantly changing, skills need continual updating and stability is hard to find, many are rethinking how retirement is viewed. Instead of thinking of retirement as a destination 30 or 40 years from now that must be funded with a huge cash reserve, thinking of creating financial independence through passive income streams feels more attainable.</p>\n<p>If financial independence is a strategy that will provide ongoing income there are several things that must be accomplished to make this a reality. Here are some tips and ideas on creating passive income.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Is Passive Income</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating a passive income stream, looks at investment opportunities through the lens of providing ongoing income, rather than accumulating large amounts of investments that will be withdrawn at some point in the future. The traditional passive income streams were social security and pension plans which would pay a set amount of money each month until you die. With these passive income streams additional work was not required and the funds would last until you died, ensuring you would never outlive the money.</p>\n<p>Today those traditional passive income streams like pensions cannot be relied on. This has left workers with 401ks and IRAs as the funding options for retirement. These are great options, but with jobs changing and the average worker going through a dozen or more jobs in a career, even this is not enough to provide ongoing security. This has required Millennials to be more creative when they think about savings, investing and preparing for an uncertain future.</p>\n<p>Having an investment portfolio that can provide a monthly income stream, a business that produces ongoing income, rental property, part time work or freelancing are all options for ongoing income. In the beginning these options require work and forethought but over time they can produce a passive income stream that can provide much higher levels of security.</p>\n<h3><strong>Keys to Building Passive Income</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Start Early</strong></h4>\n<p>As with all investments the more time a plan has to work and develop the better it will work for you. If you have a hobby you are passionate about that you can build into a viable business, starting now will give you decades to build the business into an operation that requires less of your time and attention. This income can then provide as a respite if you have employment gaps throughout your career. With both nontraditional and traditional investments alike, starting early will reap the highest level of benefits and income.</p>\n<h4><strong>Watch Spending</strong></h4>\n<p>Living frugally became a buzzword a few years back as it became more mainstream. Living within your means will always provide money that can be invested in your future, instead of paying for yesterday’s spending. The other advantage to frugal living is that you need less passive income to maintain your quality of life. As your income increases throughout your career, keeping your spending in tact will be rewarded with more investments that can be directed toward passive income opportunities.</p>\n<h4><strong>Keep Your Eyes Open for Opportunities</strong></h4>\n<p>Passive income requires creativity with investments. It means thinking in terms of multiple streams of income and investment options that will grow during your working years and then produce income when you need it. Many opportunities do not produce passive income immediately, but will over time.</p>\n<p>When you look at adding activities to your life that are more fulfilling, investment opportunities will present themselves. This might be a chance to earn a second income doing something you love. It might mean nontraditional ways of earning money. Thinking outside the box is the key. One friend buys fireworks when they really inexpensive, before the season and then sells them during the holidays where fireworks are popular (4<sup>th</sup> of July and New Year’s being the two best holidays). This gives him a boost of several thousand dollars a few times a year. He then takes those earnings and invests them to build a portfolio of passive income that he can later use. Income and investment opportunities are everywhere when you are looking for them.</p>\n<h4><strong>Be Patient</strong></h4>\n<p>While we get used to instant gratification, the best things in life take both our time and energy. They do not always work out like we planned but they are worth our time and effort because in the end they pay off. Investments are the same way. When looking for passive income streams be willing to look at the long term benefits and dedicate the time necessary to grow your investments in a strategic way.</p>\n<p>It is a lot less overwhelming to think in terms of establishing an income stream of $3,000 to $4,000 a month, than to think in terms of needing to save a million dollars for a comfortable retirement. Changing the way you look at investments might be just what you need to get started on your way to financial independence.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">Retirement Planning services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement/\">Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/you-only-live-once-retirement-goal/\">YOLO (You Only Live Once) so you Need a Retirement Goal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/your-401k-program/\">Your 401K Program: A Little Savings Now Goes a Long Way</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-much-money-do-you-need-for-retirement/\">How Much Money do you Need for Retirement These Days?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"fhttp://www.shermanwealth.com/benefits-saving-early-for-retirement/\">The Benefits of Saving Early for Retirement</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/advantages-of-participating-in-your-workplace-retirement-plan/\">Advantages of Participating in Your Workplace Retirement Plan</a></p>\n<p>LFS-1094765-011215</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/140cf600575ec19c84474f8d53f78751/da113/Financial-Independence-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/140cf600575ec19c84474f8d53f78751/3f132/Financial-Independence-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/140cf600575ec19c84474f8d53f78751/8850c/Financial-Independence-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/140cf600575ec19c84474f8d53f78751/da113/Financial-Independence-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/140cf600575ec19c84474f8d53f78751/7223d/Financial-Independence-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/140cf600575ec19c84474f8d53f78751/f2cbb/Financial-Independence-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/140cf600575ec19c84474f8d53f78751/bd6e6/Financial-Independence-1.jpg 892w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"3354632e-8893-53de-be82-308dd85a23e4","slug":"7-ways-maximize-bonus","title":"7 Ways to Maximize A Bonus or a Raise","content":"<h4><strong>Just got a bonus or a raise? Read these tips before you start Googling airfares to Thailand…</strong></h4>\n<p>Using a bonus or a raise to catch up in financial areas where you’ve fallen behind is a great way to jump start 2015. From paying off high interest debt to setting up a college savings plan, there are plenty of smart ways to put that chunk of change to good use.</p>\n<h4><strong>Pay off High Interest Loans</strong></h4>\n<p>It may feel impossible to escape the credit card damage you did in college or mounting loans. But you actually<em> can</em> make a dent in your debt by using your bonus for a large payment. This lowers your balance and minimizes some of those high interest charges moving forward. Get a snapshot of where you stand with the <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/debtrepayment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debt Repayment Calculator</a> from Credit Karma.</p>\n<h4><strong>Rebalance Your Investment Portfolio</strong></h4>\n<p>Those extra funds are a great reason to take a closer look at your assets and determine what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.<strong> </strong>We can help you adjust to create the right balance between return and risk, ensuring you&#8217;re pursing both long and short-term financial goals.</p>\n<h4><strong>Start a College Savings Plan </strong></h4>\n<p>Even if your kids are in diapers, it&#8217;s never too early to start saving for their college education. By starting early and using the variety of college savings programs available today, you can get a good head start on a college savings account.  There are a couple of different types of college savings savings plans and each has different features and potential tax benefits.    A financial advisor can help you determine the plan that suits your situation.  The <a href=\"http://www.collegesavings.org/gettingStarted.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">College Savings Plan Network</a> also offers great resources and tips for getting started.</p>\n<h4><strong>Think About Retiring</strong></h4>\n<p>Unless you received a<em> <strong>really</strong></em> enormous bonus, we don&#8217;t mean retire now. But if you haven&#8217;t reached your company&#8217;s 401(k) contribution limits, use your bonus to max out those weekly or monthly contributions. If your employer matches&#8230; consider that bonus doubled.</p>\n<h4><strong> Open an Investment Account</strong></h4>\n<p>Planning for the future can be daunting, especially when you have large expenses to deal with <em>now</em>. But the earlier you start investing <strong>(even low monthly contributions)</strong>, the longer your money has to grow.  Rather than let it sit in your checking account, create an investment account with your bonus to kick-start a financial safety net.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prep for an Emergency</strong></h4>\n<p>Fun? No. Smart? Yes. Unexpected issues pop up and can throw your monthly budget off track. Get prepared by setting up a fund for irregular expenses and circumstances like job loss, repairs, or costly medical bills for people and pets. A good rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses saved up for those worst-case scenarios.</p>\n<h4><strong>Save for a Rainy Day</strong></h4>\n<p>It may be tempting to book a trip somewhere warm or buy a TV that covers every square inch of your wall space. While it’s best to take care of outstanding debt and invest wisely, you deserve to have a little fun for burning the midnight oil at the office all year. Be sure to put a small portion of your bonus aside to treat yourself or your family to something special when the time is right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LFS-1094780-011215</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3888888888888888,"src":"/static/c9a2ff8382a43a68659f7c0a41adbe54/da113/7-Ways-to-Maximize-Your-Bonus2-2-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c9a2ff8382a43a68659f7c0a41adbe54/3f132/7-Ways-to-Maximize-Your-Bonus2-2-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/c9a2ff8382a43a68659f7c0a41adbe54/8850c/7-Ways-to-Maximize-Your-Bonus2-2-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/c9a2ff8382a43a68659f7c0a41adbe54/da113/7-Ways-to-Maximize-Your-Bonus2-2-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/c9a2ff8382a43a68659f7c0a41adbe54/7223d/7-Ways-to-Maximize-Your-Bonus2-2-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/c9a2ff8382a43a68659f7c0a41adbe54/f2cbb/7-Ways-to-Maximize-Your-Bonus2-2-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/c9a2ff8382a43a68659f7c0a41adbe54/a9c4a/7-Ways-to-Maximize-Your-Bonus2-2-1.jpg 864w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"b9ea52f0-4960-5a63-a72d-ad8d3fa1134b","slug":"5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont","title":"5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do","content":"<h3>These simple strategies can make a big impact on your long term portfolio.</h3>\n<p>Investing and finances can be overwhelming and confusing. Having so many options available, how is an investor to choose which direction to go. For those who seek to understand, it can become paralysis by analysis, where the more you study, the more you realize you need to know. With all of its complexity, simple investment strategies can be very effective, if the right choices are made.</p>\n<h3><strong>Here are 5 Strategies most average investors don’t focus on, but should.</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Have a thought out strategy with a purpose</strong>. A common mistake of investors is to put money in an account without a lot of thought as to the goals you want to achieve. Starting an investment fund without goals is like driving in a car with no destination in mind. Without a purpose for the money, it is impossible to measure the success or failure of the investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start Early with a Time Horizon</strong>. Starting early gives your money more time to grow. The longer the money is invested, the better it can weather market fluctuations and the more likely you are to successfully reach your goals. Along these same lines, set specific goals around a time horizon. How long will each bucket of money be invested? This is a very important piece to your overall strategy because it will help evaluate the specific investments that will be most beneficial. If you are 15 years away from your goal, investment choices will be much different than if you are 5. The closer you get to the destination, the less able you are weather market fluctuations. This should be considered in your overall strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increase The Amount Invested Each Year</strong>. When looking over your investment strategy, separate the performance and the contributions. The performance is how much your money has grown through your investment strategies. Contributions are the dollar amount that you have added to your investment accounts. These two factors make up the total growth of your portfolio. Both of these numbers are important to your overall strategy. The account performance should be reviewed independent of contributions to help you stay on track with the right investment choices for your risk tolerance and time horizon. The amount you have added in contributions is what you have built into your budget for long term financial goals. When you increase those contributions each year, your account should grow significantly faster. Small increases are often not felt in the monthly budget.Let’s say you currently contribute <strong>6%</strong> from your paycheck into your <strong>401k</strong>. In addition to that you are putting $50 a month into your IRA and <strong>$50</strong> a month into a  college fund. At the beginning of the year, increase your 401k contribution by<strong> 1%</strong>. Now you are putting away<strong> 7%</strong> in pretax dollars for retirement. Then the next quarter increase your IRA contribution to <strong>$75</strong> a month and the quarter after that, increase your college fund contributions by <strong>$25</strong> a month. These small increments will barely be noticed in your monthly budget. The <strong>$25</strong> a month increase is less than <strong>$1</strong> a day. If you are earning <strong>$50,000</strong> a year, the<strong> 1% i</strong>ncrease with your 401k is only around $21 a paycheck if you get paid bi-monthly, in pretax dollars. Meaning your paycheck will be reduced by less than $20 a paycheck due to the pretax allocation. If you increase the contribution at the time of your annual raise, it will only be noticed in the form of larger investment accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review your asset allocation as a whole picture</strong>. When you have separate investments for different financial goals, it is more of a challenge to see your portfolio in a complete picture. Having investments with different companies can increase these challenges. When you have a 401k at a current job, and maybe one or two from previous jobs, they are more difficult to keep up with. Then you might have current investments for retirement, college and savings for your first home. Taking a holistic view of all your investments will help to ensure you have the best asset allocation possible. When your allocation gets out of whack, you might end up taking on more risk than you are comfortable with, without realizing it. It is not always possible to have all your investments under one roof, especially with a current 401k. However, including these investments in all financial reviews will help you stay on track for your overall investment goals as well as ensuring your asset allocation and risk profile are appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Understanding what you can control</strong>. In life we like to have control over our current and future destinations. Happiness and success often come from recognizing what we can control and focusing on that. Investing is no different. We cannot control the markets and we cannot control the economy. There is a host of circumstances and events that are outside of our control. Stressing and worrying about those things is not beneficial. You can control spending and investment rate. You can control which investments you choose and the amount of risk in your portfolio. Staying focused on these elements will lead to higher comfort levels which will encourage staying the course.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Financial investing success has more to do with implementing sound strategies, rather than luck or great market timing.

You work hard for your money and even losing money on paper, to market fluctuations, can make you want to put all your cash under the mattress. In reality most investments will have volatility. Fixed rate products like CD’s may not have volatility, but will have their own risk of not keeping up with inflation. Currently 1 year CD’s are paying around 1%, and 5 year CD’s are only paying around 2%, according to <a href=\"Bankrate.com\">Bankrate</a>. This makes it necessary to have investments in your portfolio, which will fluctuate in value, in order to potentially have the needed funds to pursue your financial goals.</p>\n<p>With inflation averaging <strong>3.22%</strong> per year from 1913 to 2013², it is easy to see that establishing an investment portfolio that provides higher returns than inflation is essential to any long term plan. Investors look to mitigate the risk of the volatile markets, while seeking a return that will build investment values.</p>\n<p>For all its Bull and Bear markets, runs and crashes, stock market investments in the last 100 years has been positive when looking at any 10 year period from 1903 to December 1912³. The average stock market return since 1932 is around <strong>7%</strong> and when inflation is taken into account the average return is over <strong>10%</strong>⁴. So while the markets do go up and down on a daily basis, the overall market pattern has a consistent upward trend. However, past performance is not indicative of future results and your investments selection(s) and time horizon will affect your results.</p>\n<h3>Investing With Your Risk Tolerance in Mind</h3>\n<p>Investment risk, by definition, is the likelihood of losses in relation to an expected rate of return for a specific investment. All investments have some investment risk. The challenge for you is to determine which investments have risks you are willing to accept, and may be potentially rewarded with higher returns on a consistent enough basis.</p>\n<p>This is where a Sherman Wealth Management financial professional comes in. They work with you to determine a level of risk that is suitable for you and provide the potential growth needed to pursue your financial objectives. This requires not only understanding specific investments but also having a good pulse on what you, as an investor, need.</p>\n<p>In order to give the best advice, it is necessary to truly understand the client’s needs. Just asking, how much risk are you comfortable with, is not enough. Educating and teaching you about risk and what it may mean for your future, is the goal. This allows you to select investments that reflect your risk tolerance and financial aspirations.</p>\n<p>Taking a high level of personal interest in the changing needs of our clients is our goal. We believe this is the best strategy for maintaining an investment portfolio that is designed to have the appropriate amount of risk to pursue your financial goals, while striving to minimize the risk taken on individual investment choices.</p>\n<p>Each investor has individual needs and no investor’s taste for risk is the same. You need recommendations that take all of your circumstances and life goals into account. Added risk might lead to higher returns, but not always.</p>\n<p>If you have a lower tolerance for risk, building an investment portfolio that is designed to withstand market turmoil is more appropriate. These strategies still experience ups and downs, but the right blend of investments potentially moderate the fluctuations to align with your tolerance for risk.</p>\n<p>The stock market offers investments that carry various levels of risk. There are value, dividend paying stocks that have a lower volatility than emerging small cap stocks. Bonds are also available at various risk levels, allowing you to manage risk and performance within the portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Asset Allocation for Mitigating Volatility</h3>\n<p>Another method to help mitigate market risk and volatility is through Asset Allocation. This is the process of using several asset classes within an investment portfolio by apportioning a portfolio’s assets according to the individual goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stock market investments have the general categories of stocks and bonds.</p>\n<p>Stocks are broken down further between value stocks and growth stocks, with value generally being more conservative. Stocks that pay dividends are usually more conservative than stocks that do not, because investors are getting some return while they still hold the position. Stocks are also broken down by company size. These are denoted as large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks. Large cap stocks include companies like Microsoft, Apple, Bank of America and national names we all recognize. Small cap companies are those with 300 million to 2 billion in revenue, and mid-caps are between these two. The last large category is US companies and International or global companies.</p>\n<p>Bonds are rated much like individual credit is rated. There are consumers that are a much lower risk than others and this is measured through individual credit scores. Bonds operate in a similar way. There are independent credit agencies like<strong> S&amp;P</strong> and, Moody’s which rate company bond offerings. Bond ratings are expressed as letters ranging from &#8216;<strong>AAA</strong>&#8216;, which is the highest grade, to &#8216;C&#8217; (&#8220;<strong>junk</strong>&#8220;), which is the lowest grade. Different rating services use the same letter grades, but use various combinations of upper- and lower-case letters to differentiate themselves. Lower ratings represent higher default risk and thus higher interest rates to investors.</p>\n<p>Selecting the best mix of stocks and bonds is a delicate balance. Spreading your investments choices across different categories may provide an effective way to reduce the overall volatility of a portfolio. As the market fluctuates not all stocks and bonds move up and down at the same rate or the same time. When asset allocation is used correctly there is a designed buffer against losses and the overall risk of the portfolio should be reduced.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages of Dollar Cost Averaging</strong></p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed dollar amount on a regular schedule, regardless of the actual price of the stock, bond or other investment vehicle. There are several advantages to using this strategy.</p>\n<p>Smaller amounts can be invested providing potential benefits of growth over time. Time in the market is much more important than market timing and dollar cost averaging gets you in the market on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Buying more shares when the stock has a lower price and less shares when the price is higher. . Even the best companies will see stock prices fluctuate based on a current news reports, events that impacts the industry, or seasonal fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging helps reduce the risk of the overall portfolio because you are investing at regular intervals and buying more shares when the prices are low. This can be an effective way to grow your portfolio. Studies have shown that those who invest in regular intervals are more consistent with their investments, providing better overall growth, according to Morningstar⁵.</p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.</p>\n<p>Financial strategies require a long term strategy. As such, volatility must be considered in your investment choices. Avoiding volatility because of fear can result in negative returns, when adding the impact of inflation. Working with a financial professional who understands volatility and uses strategies designed to enable you to build a portfolio which is suitable to your risk tolerance.

There are three major ways in which men and women differ when it comes to behavioral investing.</p>\n<p><strong>Investment Goals and Strategies:</strong> According to the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/\">Wall Street Journal</a>, finance professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, women tend to focus more on longer-term, non-monetary goals. Women generally associate money with security, independence and the quality of their life and their families’ lives. Women have a <strong>‘safety first’</strong> mentality. Generally speaking, women are more inclined than men to wear seat belts, avoid cigarette smoking, floss and brush their teeth and make regular doctor visits. They even have been shown to be<strong> 40%</strong> less prone than men to run yellow traffic lights. Men, on the other hand, who tend to be more competitive and thrill-seeking by nature, often focus on the short-term track records of their portfolios, incurring larger overall returns, and tend to be more risk tolerant. In contrast, women tend to be more averse to risk and are more skeptical. When it comes to investing and planning for their future, women shy away from uncertainty and will take a longer time to make investment decisions, are more methodical in how they go about research, and ask more questions.</p>\n<p>Both men and women should make sure that their investment styles and horizons match their overall financial goals. For women, this may mean taking on more risk. As they become more familiar and understand the ups and down of the stock market they will naturally become more risk tolerant. For men, this may mean focusing more on longer-horizon goals, rather than on short-term trading track records and larger gains.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_307\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-307\" style=\"width: 245px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-307 size-medium\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Women-Risk-Averse-1-245x300.png\" alt=\"Women Risk Averse\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-307\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prudential&#8217;s study Financial Experience &amp; Behaviors Among Women</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Learning Curve: </strong>A 2012-2013 Prudential study on women investors reveals that women are more receptive to financial research and advice than men. Women seek help more often. Men tend to enjoy learning on their own and take a more independent approach, like the internet,  while women prefer learning in a group setting. Women rely more on personal networks with friends, family, financial planners, and they take a networking approach to gathering information. They often require more of a financial advisor’s time and resources, but are looking for a trusted relationship to be established, one  they can rely on long term. Men, however,  prefer to teach themselves and are more self-directed learners, using the Internet (more often than women) to gather information and are more likely to claim they understand financial matters than women. In actuality,  knowledge levels are not high for either gender.</p>\n<p>Thus far, evidence does not support, however, whether one source of information or learning technique is more or less effective than another.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_311\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-311\" style=\"width: 957px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-311 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Information-Sources-Used-By-Men-Vs-Women-1.png\" alt=\"Information Sources Used By Men Vs Women\" width=\"957\" height=\"432\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-311\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Source: Women &amp; Investing, Gender differences in investment behavior. FINRA Report August 2006</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Confidence Factor:</strong> Women tend to be thorough and take more time to make decisions than men. Several studies, including a national survey by LPL Financial, show that women tend to research investments in depth before making portfolio decisions, and the process, as a result, tends to take more time. Women also tend to be more patient as investors and consult their advisors before adjusting their portfolio positioning, whereas men are more prone to market timing impulses. Men veer toward overconfidence while women lean towards indecisiveness and insecurity.</p>\n<p>Overconfidence can lead to taking too much risk. While women risk missing out on some investment opportunities in taking more time to make decisions, men’s generally higher impatience when it comes to seeing investment returns makes them more likely to attempt market timing, and prone to loss when the timing is off. Women are less afflicted than men by overconfidence, or the delusion that they know more than they really do and are more likely (than men) to attribute success to factors outside themselves, like luck or fate.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-318 size-large\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ledbury-Research-1-1024x255.png\" alt=\"Ledbury Research\" width=\"980\" height=\"244\" /></p>\n<p>Yet, taking too little risk, due to lack of confidence, can hurt your investment goals just as much as overconfidence. When it comes to investing for the long term, taking risk is not a luxury. Insecure investors can confine their results by investing too conservatively, nearly as much as their overeager counterparts could do by excessive trading and risk-taking.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, to help avoid rash decisions and market impulses, men may benefit from implementing a systematic investment strategy and a periodic, rather than continuous, review of their accounts and rebalancing. They may want to consider becoming even more open to professional financial advice. Women may also want to review the efficiency of their investment allocations across their portfolios to counter the negative impact of mental accounting. In addition, they may want to consider attending financial education seminars to help boost their confidence levels and ability to make timely, well-informed investment decisions.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_321\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-321\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-321 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Men-Vs-Women-Confidence-Level-1.png\" alt=\"Men Vs Women Confidence Level\" width=\"915\" height=\"415\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Women &amp; Investing, Gender differences in investment behavior.

But when it comes to your finances, is society sending us a detrimental message?</p>\n<p>When addressing one’s plans for retirement, it is sometimes difficult to find a happy medium between the avoidance of financial responsibilities and the overwhelming, anxiety-inducing worry over one’s financial future. Below are two very common thought processes that I see often.</p>\n<p><strong>1) I am not worried about the future now, I’ll deal with it later</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our day-to-day pressing needs and our live-for-today goals become the priority and we cannot focus on or visualize what is not right in front of us. We tell ourselves, ‘I’ll do it tomorrow.’ Whether it’s not participating in a 401K because the extra monthly money is needed for utility bills or prolonging the start of a college savings fund for your child because you have mortgage payments to make, you are setting yourself up for a worrisome retirement.</p>\n<p>It is important that you stop and visualize, in vivid detail, a big retirement goal. Are you visualizing being able to enjoy the finer things in life or are you just hoping to maintain the lifestyle that you are living today? What details do you see when you make this visualization?</p>\n<p>Consider these important factors while you are visualizing:</p>\n<p><strong><em>If I continue at today’s rate-of-saving, what will my savings be at retirement?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I have children? Do I plan to have more children?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I plan to send my children to college?/Can I afford college tuition?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I own a home? Do I have a mortgage?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Have I planned for rising health concerns as I get older?</em></strong></p>\n<p>If something should happen to me, will my family be taken care of?/What kind of debt will they incur?</p>\n<p><strong>2.) I worry so much about my future financial position, that I sacrifice my daily happiness</strong></p>\n<p>Studies have shown that intense worrying about money or financial situations can affect many aspects of your life from mental health, to relationships, to career. When consumed with worry over your finances, it can inflict on your ability to focus thus creating a distraction and inability to enjoy the present.</p>\n<p>While it is important to plan for the future, it should not be so overwhelming that it interferes with one’s day-to-day abilities. Ask yourself:</p>\n<p><em><strong>What am I really worried about?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Is it something in my control? If so, am I taking the necessary steps?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>If it is not in my control, what steps can I take to ease my anxiety?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Do I have a financial advisor that can help to address financial concerns and alleviate unnecessary worry?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Whether you identify more with the first or second way of approaching your finances, or possibly somewhere in the middle, it is important to address your financial concerns with a trusted financial advisor. Unnecessary worry can cause you to feel paralyzed, out of control, and unable to make the right financial decisions concerning your retirement. However, failing to address future financial responsibilities, and avoidance altogether, can prove to be counterintuitive, creating anxiety and worry at a later date. Suddenly financial responsibilities show up at your door and you no longer have the option to ignore or put off. In taking small steps along the way, you can gain control of both your finances and your worry.</p>\n<p>Call Brad Sherman at <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Sherman Wealth Management</a> today and set up a no-cost financial consultation.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">Retirement Planning services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement/\">Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/finding-financial-independence/\">Finding Financial Independence</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/your-401k-program/\">Your 401K Program: A Little Savings Now Goes a Long Way</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-much-money-do-you-need-for-retirement/\">How Much Money do you Need for Retirement These Days?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"fhttp://www.shermanwealth.com/benefits-saving-early-for-retirement/\">The Benefits of Saving Early for Retirement</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/advantages-of-participating-in-your-workplace-retirement-plan/\">Advantages of Participating in Your Workplace Retirement Plan</a></p>\n<p>LFS-926223-051514</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/b65c2ecdbf1befee4ac816c0e790599d/da113/Yolo-Retirement-Goal-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b65c2ecdbf1befee4ac816c0e790599d/3f132/Yolo-Retirement-Goal-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/b65c2ecdbf1befee4ac816c0e790599d/8850c/Yolo-Retirement-Goal-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/b65c2ecdbf1befee4ac816c0e790599d/da113/Yolo-Retirement-Goal-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/b65c2ecdbf1befee4ac816c0e790599d/7223d/Yolo-Retirement-Goal-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/b65c2ecdbf1befee4ac816c0e790599d/2426e/Yolo-Retirement-Goal-1.jpg 680w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"c404f5f6-f3ad-5e92-adbd-8c16ee0fe870","slug":"millennials-fiscally-conservative","title":"Millennials: The Fiscally Conservative Generation","content":"<p>As the <a title=\"Millennials Wikipedia Page\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Millennial Generation</a> continues to get more work experience under their belt, statistics from a UBS Wealth Management <a title=\"UBS Survey Findings\" href=\"http://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth/misc/investor-watch.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survey</a> show that this generation is the most fiscally conservative generation since the Great Depression.
