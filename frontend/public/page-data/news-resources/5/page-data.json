Having grown up with social media and the internet, this generation is not as private as their parents and grandparents are, especially about subjects like money and finance. The advantage is that open conversations can reduce fears and increase understanding, which can result in better decision making.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yet, with all this comfort in discussing financial matters, many <strong>Millennials</strong> are hesitant to meet with a financial advisor. It&#8217;s one thing to gather information from family and friends or read articles about investing, it&#8217;s another to discuss your personal information with a financial advisor. That&#8217;s when it moves from theoretical to personal and that can create a great deal of fear and discomfort.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why Fear Gets the Best of Us</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How Much Do You Really Know About Finances</b><strong>?</strong> As educated professionals, it&#8217;s common to feel like you should know everything. After all, if you don’t understand it, a few internet searches should provide the answers! </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When it comes to money matters, though, many Millennials feel like a fish out of water. Internet searches can provide information that&#8217;s both confusing and conflicting, and that doesn&#8217;t answer individual questions about strategy and direction. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then there is the question of what information can be trusted. Is the site legitimate and can the writer&#8217;s &#8211; and site&#8217;s &#8211; motivation be trusted? While financial information is plentiful, much of it&#8217;s either very general or coming from a sales site that promises a secret formula that will turn you into a millionaire. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Financial decisions by nature are very individual and personal. Because there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all investing strategy, personal consultations are invaluable.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Advisor motivations</b>. Can the advisor be trusted? A trusted advisor needs to understand your circumstances, goals, dreams, and aspirations. Once they do, they can help to create a long term strategy that will help to make those dreams a reality. But you must be able to trust that your advisor will make recommendations that are most beneficial to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">you</span>, the client, not the best for them, the advisor.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Addressing these concerns in an open conversation will go a long way. No one wants to be sold a product. We all want to invest money in a sound strategy. Understanding the reasons for the recommendation will help you understand how it may benefit you and help you pursue your long term goals. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Fear of not being understood</b>. As complicated individuals we want to appear like we have everything in order. In reality, sometimes we&#8217;re confident, other times not so much. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Financial advisors have seen nearly every level of financial preparedness. They have seen financial messes and worked with clients to get things corrected. They have seen strong portfolios, weak portfolios, no portfolio, and everything in between.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if you don&#8217;t feel you have all your ducks in a row, an advisor can help. If you&#8217;ve made bad decisions in the past, they can make recommendations for corrective action. If you&#8217;ve been unable to get things in order on your own, working with a professional can be the fastest way to get on track.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Markets not doing as expected</b>. This can go two ways. If you invest conservatively and the market takes off you might end up kicking yourself for not being more aggressive. If the markets are slow and you invest aggressively you can end up wishing you&#8217;d been more conservative. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you meet with an advisor, you&#8217;re meeting with a professional who understands the investment business and who can make recommendations that are consistent with your financial goals. An advisor does not have a crystal ball; remember that long term investing is not about beating the markets, it’s about making strong financial decisions that over time will lead to increased confidence in financial matters.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pulling the Trigger</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first step is always the hardest. This is true whether you&#8217;re trying to establish a workout routine, learn a new language, start a new job, or change your investing strategy. Resisting change is natural and we are creatures of habit. However, there comes a point when, in order to grow and progress, we have to stop making excuses and get started by meeting with a financial advisor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make the appointment. Even if you don’t think you know enough, have enough money to invest, have a good enough paying job, or whatever the excuses for delays have been. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Before you meet with the advisor</b>, write down questions you have. What things have you heard and what things do you want to understand. This can guide the conversation as you begin to develop a relationship with an advisor. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A financial advisor at <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Sherman Wealth</a> is someone you&#8217;ll want to get to know!

Be sure to reexamine your goals and your portfolio to make sure that you&#8217;re both saving enough for retirement, and that you <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">maintain a proper asset allocation</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Life Insurance</strong> – While not a pleasant topic, it&#8217;s important to discuss with your partner what will happen in the event that one of you passes prematurely. If one, or both of you, are dependent on the other person’s income, you may want to consider purchasing a term-life insurance policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Wills and Trusts</strong> – Like life insurance, wills and trusts also are important for protecting your loved ones. They&#8217;re especially critical if you have children, or a significant amount of assets. Make sure that your assets are directed in a way that&#8217;s consistent with your wishes.</li>\n<li><strong>College Funds</strong> – If you have children, or are considering having children, you definitely want to discuss a saving strategy to help pay for college tuition. Like retirement savings, a little bit now can go a long way.</li>\n<li><strong>Health Insurance</strong> – Make sure that you and your partner are both covered, and that you understand the differences &#8211; and overlaps &#8211; in  your plans. Is there any unnecessary overlap? Should you purchase more coverage to protect yourself? Or should you switch to a high-deductible plan to save money? These are questions that should be reviewed at least once annually!</li>\n<li><strong>Major Purchases</strong> – If you are planning to make a major purchase such as a home, or a new car, you&#8217;ve probably already talked with your partner about it. You may not have talked about how you&#8217;ll pay for it though! Some questions to consider: whether or not you&#8217;ll pay cash for the purchase;  if you finance it, what type of down payment you will make, and over what period of time; and if you need to cut down on expenses elsewhere to save up for the purchase.</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong> – Review your expenses each month to see where you can make changes and cut back. Consider making a budget together to make sure that you are allocating your income in the best possible way for both of you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While financial topics can be difficult to discuss, they&#8217;re an important part of a happy and successful relationship. Make sure that both you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to finances, and set short and long term goals <em>together</em> to help keep you both on track.</p>\n<p>If you need help going over your finances or coming up with a plan, it may be wise to contact a financial planner. Financial planners can help point you in the right direction, based on your own goals, and help facilitate difficult, but important, discussions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This might mean a percentage of every paycheck that is used for investing or a specific dollar amount. You might start with as little as <strong>$50</strong> a month or <strong>$50</strong> a pay period and that will begin to create a portfolio that pays for future needs.</p>\n<h3>Advantages of Dollar Cost Averaging</h3>\n<p><strong>1) Establishes a habit of investing.</strong> One of the largest benefits is you begin to pay yourself first and take care of future needs today. Establishing a habit of setting aside a little money for tomorrow will help you live within your means, have more thoughtful budgeting, and be better prepared.</p>\n<p><strong>2) The investment is built into your budget</strong>, and you learn to live on what remains. The interesting thing about money and finances is that you tend to spend what you have. If there is a little less in the account each month you will adjust spending to accommodate for what you have. Even if it does not appear that there is money for investing you might be surprised how easy it is to “find” a small amount that can be earmarked for investments. A simple thing like bringing lunch twice a week instead of eating out can result in saving over $50 a month to use for investing.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Dollar cost averaging purchases shares at a set time each month</strong> regardless of where the investment price is. This means if the price is lower you purchase more shares. If the market is higher less shares are bought. The result is a greater tolerance for market fluctuations because you gain a better understanding that the markets move every day.</p>\n<p><strong>4) No Large Sums Required to Begin.</strong> Dollar cost averaging can be started with small amounts of money. One possible strategy is to increase monthly contributions at least annually. The more you raise the contribution amount the larger and faster your investments may grow over time.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Flexibility.</strong> Monthly contribution amounts can be changed at any time. The amounts can be raised or lowered depending on life events that impact your budget. In a perfect world the contributions would always increase, but sometimes that does not match real life events. The ability to adjust contributions reduces risk and allows for greater flexibility to meet current demands.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Great long-term strategy.</strong> Building a portfolio from the ground up can be accomplished through dollar cost averaging and regular contributions. Your investment should grow over time through both additional contributions and portfolio growth. As you receive bonuses or other financial windfalls you can make additional one time contributions as your finances allow.</p>\n<p>When it comes to investing there are no short cuts. Starting early and making regular investments will help to provide financial security and accounts that will build over time. When you start early you are less tempted to take on more portfolio risk and are better able to reach long term financial goals.</p>\n<p>The future is uncertain and setting aside a little each month to pay for long term financial needs is one of the soundest ways to pursue financial security.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/customized-financial-portfolio-construction/\">Investment Management services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">Tips for Millennials to Understanding the Stock Market</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-things-investors-get-wrong/\">5 Things Investors Get Wrong</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont/\">5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">LFS-1112149-013015</span></p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"0ec7bb14-8d23-5a94-afb0-a4d4a146690b","slug":"5-things-investors-get-wrong","title":"5 Things Investors Get Wrong","content":"<p>Humans have a tendency to behave irrationally when it comes to money. Here are the five things investors get wrong that can harm their returns.</p>\n<h3><strong>Believing They Will Beat the Market</strong></h3>\n<p>Study after study shows that investors, including professionals, continually under perform the S&amp;P.</p>\n<p>In their most recent SPIVA (<strong>S&amp;P Indices vs. Active</strong>) report, released in September, McGraw Hill Financial found that more than <strong>85%</strong> of all funds underperformed the S&amp;P 500, the index found to represent the overall market. (1).</p>\n<p>What’s scarier is the fact that individual investors do even worse. In a 20 year study conducted by Dalbar, a financial services research firm, the average investor has seen a return of just <strong>2.1%</strong> compared with the S&amp;P’s annualized return of<strong> 7.8%</strong> (2).</p>\n<p>What causes this under performance?</p>\n<p>According to Dalbar the biggest reason for this under performance by investors is due to irrational behavioral biases. These include panic selling, under-diversifying, and chasing momentum (3).</p>\n<h3><strong>Chasing Hot Stocks</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>In a study done by the University of California Berkley, as well as UC Davis, researchers found that investors are much more likely to purchase shares in companies that have recently been in the news (4), bidding the price of these stocks up.</p>\n<p>Additionally many investors make the mistake of trying to chase performance by buying investments that have already risen significantly. A 2011 study by Baird, a wealth management firm, suggests that investors generally chase short-term performance by buying funds that have risen in the short run, and selling those that have performed poorly (5).</p>\n<p>The same can be said about the market as a whole where investors tend to purchase stocks after they have seen a large rise, and subsequently sell into weakness (6).</p>\n<p>In short, investors sell low, and buy high.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ignoring Fees</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>You probably know that fees are important, what you may not realize is just how important they are.</p>\n<p>Take for example two 30-year-old investors who each contribute <strong>$5,500</strong> annually to their IRAs. They both achieve<strong> 9%</strong> annualized returns, before fees, over the next 35 years. The only difference between them is that one investor pays annual fees of <strong>.5%</strong>, while the other investor pays <strong>2.5%</strong> in total fees. Over the course of their working career, investor A will have accumulated <strong>$1,059,859.21</strong> in their account while investor B will have <strong>$682,190.80</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>This is a hypothetical illustration only and is not indicative of any particular investment or performance. Return and principal value may fluctuate, so when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than the original cost. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</em></p>\n<p>In this example, <strong>Investor B’s</strong> IRA will be worth less than <strong>65%</strong> of <strong>Investor’s A</strong> account as a result of a <strong>2%</strong> difference in fees!</p>\n<h3><strong>Not Re-balancing<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>While buy-and-hold is usually a good strategy for most people, it is sometimes necessary for individuals to make slight tweaks to their investments.</p>\n<p>This is particularly important if you have had one asset class or investment rise or fall significantly more than the rest of your portfolio. In this case it is a good idea to re balance your portfolio in order to realign it with your target allocation. This ensures that you not only maintain diversity, but also that you buy low, and sell high, by buying assets that have fallen significantly and selling assets that have risen.</p>\n<h3><strong>Turning to the Wrong People for Advice</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>Financial advice and information has never been more accessible to the average investor than it is today. Between TV and the Internet, investors are bombarded with information on a daily basis. Unfortunately not all of this information is sound.</p>\n<p>Investors should consider carefully the source of any advice they receive, watching out for potential conflicts of interest. Before making any investment decisions you should carefully consider all options, and consider speaking with a financial advisor.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/customized-financial-portfolio-construction/\">Investment Management services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">Tips for Millennials to Understanding the Stock Market</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dollar-cost-averaging/\">What is Dollar Cost Averaging?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont/\">5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/resource-center/thought-leadership/spiva/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://us.spindices.com/resource-center/thought-leadership/spiva/</a></p>\n<p>2. <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/11621555/1/average-investor-20-year-return-astoundingly-awful.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.thestreet.com/story/11621555/1/average-investor-20-year-return-astoundingly-awful.html</a></p>\n<p>3. <a href=\"http://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/streettalk_100814.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/streettalk_100814.php</a></p>\n<p>4. <a href=\"http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf</a></p>\n<p>5. <a href=\"http://www.rwbaird.com/bolimages/Media/PDF/Whitepapers/Truth-About-Top-Performing-Money-Managers.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.rwbaird.com/bolimages/Media/PDF/Whitepapers/Truth-About-Top-Performing-Money-Managers.pdf</a></p>\n<p>6. <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/487000/sell-low-buy-high-are-investors-being-stupid-again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://theweek.com/articles/487000/sell-low-buy-high-are-investors-being-stupid-again</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><b>LFS-1101254-011915</b></span></p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"c51918fa-2043-5610-97b8-bc468d9d6839","slug":"finding-financial-independence","title":"Finding Financial Independence","content":"<p>Financial Independence has become the goal for many who struggle with the overwhelming task of funding a long term retirement strategy that is so far away. In a world where jobs are constantly changing, skills need continual updating and stability is hard to find, many are rethinking how retirement is viewed. Instead of thinking of retirement as a destination 30 or 40 years from now that must be funded with a huge cash reserve, thinking of creating financial independence through passive income streams feels more attainable.</p>\n<p>If financial independence is a strategy that will provide ongoing income there are several things that must be accomplished to make this a reality. Here are some tips and ideas on creating passive income.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Is Passive Income</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating a passive income stream, looks at investment opportunities through the lens of providing ongoing income, rather than accumulating large amounts of investments that will be withdrawn at some point in the future. The traditional passive income streams were social security and pension plans which would pay a set amount of money each month until you die. With these passive income streams additional work was not required and the funds would last until you died, ensuring you would never outlive the money.</p>\n<p>Today those traditional passive income streams like pensions cannot be relied on. This has left workers with 401ks and IRAs as the funding options for retirement. These are great options, but with jobs changing and the average worker going through a dozen or more jobs in a career, even this is not enough to provide ongoing security. This has required Millennials to be more creative when they think about savings, investing and preparing for an uncertain future.</p>\n<p>Having an investment portfolio that can provide a monthly income stream, a business that produces ongoing income, rental property, part time work or freelancing are all options for ongoing income. In the beginning these options require work and forethought but over time they can produce a passive income stream that can provide much higher levels of security.</p>\n<h3><strong>Keys to Building Passive Income</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Start Early</strong></h4>\n<p>As with all investments the more time a plan has to work and develop the better it will work for you. If you have a hobby you are passionate about that you can build into a viable business, starting now will give you decades to build the business into an operation that requires less of your time and attention. This income can then provide as a respite if you have employment gaps throughout your career. With both nontraditional and traditional investments alike, starting early will reap the highest level of benefits and income.</p>\n<h4><strong>Watch Spending</strong></h4>\n<p>Living frugally became a buzzword a few years back as it became more mainstream. Living within your means will always provide money that can be invested in your future, instead of paying for yesterday’s spending. The other advantage to frugal living is that you need less passive income to maintain your quality of life. As your income increases throughout your career, keeping your spending in tact will be rewarded with more investments that can be directed toward passive income opportunities.</p>\n<h4><strong>Keep Your Eyes Open for Opportunities</strong></h4>\n<p>Passive income requires creativity with investments. It means thinking in terms of multiple streams of income and investment options that will grow during your working years and then produce income when you need it. Many opportunities do not produce passive income immediately, but will over time.</p>\n<p>When you look at adding activities to your life that are more fulfilling, investment opportunities will present themselves. This might be a chance to earn a second income doing something you love. It might mean nontraditional ways of earning money. Thinking outside the box is the key. One friend buys fireworks when they really inexpensive, before the season and then sells them during the holidays where fireworks are popular (4<sup>th</sup> of July and New Year’s being the two best holidays). This gives him a boost of several thousand dollars a few times a year. He then takes those earnings and invests them to build a portfolio of passive income that he can later use. Income and investment opportunities are everywhere when you are looking for them.</p>\n<h4><strong>Be Patient</strong></h4>\n<p>While we get used to instant gratification, the best things in life take both our time and energy. They do not always work out like we planned but they are worth our time and effort because in the end they pay off. Investments are the same way. When looking for passive income streams be willing to look at the long term benefits and dedicate the time necessary to grow your investments in a strategic way.</p>\n<p>It is a lot less overwhelming to think in terms of establishing an income stream of $3,000 to $4,000 a month, than to think in terms of needing to save a million dollars for a comfortable retirement. Changing the way you look at investments might be just what you need to get started on your way to financial independence.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">Retirement Planning services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement/\">Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/you-only-live-once-retirement-goal/\">YOLO (You Only Live Once) so you Need a Retirement Goal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/your-401k-program/\">Your 401K Program: A Little Savings Now Goes a Long Way</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-much-money-do-you-need-for-retirement/\">How Much Money do you Need for Retirement These Days?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"fhttp://www.shermanwealth.com/benefits-saving-early-for-retirement/\">The Benefits of Saving Early for Retirement</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/advantages-of-participating-in-your-workplace-retirement-plan/\">Advantages of Participating in Your Workplace Retirement Plan</a></p>\n<p>LFS-1094765-011215</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"1ff5b893-7cf7-5727-8d3a-2eec82dd0c8a","slug":"7-ways-to-maximize-a-bonus-or-a-raise","title":"7 Ways to Maximize A Bonus or a Raise","content":"<h4><strong>Just got a bonus or a raise?

But you actually<em> can</em> make a dent in your debt by using your bonus for a large payment. This lowers your balance and minimizes some of those high interest charges moving forward. Get a snapshot of where you stand with the <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/debtrepayment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debt Repayment Calculator</a> from Credit Karma.</p>\n<h4><strong>Rebalance Your Investment Portfolio</strong></h4>\n<p>Those extra funds are a great reason to take a closer look at your assets and determine what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.<strong> </strong>We can help you adjust to create the right balance between return and risk, ensuring you&#8217;re pursing both long and short-term financial goals.</p>\n<h4><strong>Start a College Savings Plan </strong></h4>\n<p>Even if your kids are in diapers, it&#8217;s never too early to start saving for their college education. By starting early and using the variety of college savings programs available today, you can get a good head start on a college savings account.  There are a couple of different types of college savings savings plans and each has different features and potential tax benefits.    A financial advisor can help you determine the plan that suits your situation.  The <a href=\"http://www.collegesavings.org/gettingStarted.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">College Savings Plan Network</a> also offers great resources and tips for getting started.</p>\n<h4><strong>Think About Retiring</strong></h4>\n<p>Unless you received a<em> <strong>really</strong></em> enormous bonus, we don&#8217;t mean retire now. But if you haven&#8217;t reached your company&#8217;s 401(k) contribution limits, use your bonus to max out those weekly or monthly contributions. If your employer matches&#8230; consider that bonus doubled.</p>\n<h4><strong> Open an Investment Account</strong></h4>\n<p>Planning for the future can be daunting, especially when you have large expenses to deal with <em>now</em>. But the earlier you start investing <strong>(even low monthly contributions)</strong>, the longer your money has to grow.  Rather than let it sit in your checking account, create an investment account with your bonus to kick-start a financial safety net.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prep for an Emergency</strong></h4>\n<p>Fun? No. Smart? Yes. Unexpected issues pop up and can throw your monthly budget off track. Get prepared by setting up a fund for irregular expenses and circumstances like job loss, repairs, or costly medical bills for people and pets. A good rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses saved up for those worst-case scenarios.</p>\n<h4><strong>Save for a Rainy Day</strong></h4>\n<p>It may be tempting to book a trip somewhere warm or buy a TV that covers every square inch of your wall space. While it’s best to take care of outstanding debt and invest wisely, you deserve to have a little fun for burning the midnight oil at the office all year. Be sure to put a small portion of your bonus aside to treat yourself or your family to something special when the time is right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LFS-1094780-011215</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"f054844d-cd0f-58f1-beeb-2763235a848a","slug":"5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont-do","title":"5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do","content":"<h3>These simple strategies can make a big impact on your long term portfolio.</h3>\n<p>Investing and finances can be overwhelming and confusing. Having so many options available, how is an investor to choose which direction to go. For those who seek to understand, it can become paralysis by analysis, where the more you study, the more you realize you need to know. With all of its complexity, simple investment strategies can be very effective, if the right choices are made.</p>\n<h3><strong>Here are 5 Strategies most average investors don’t focus on, but should.</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Have a thought out strategy with a purpose</strong>. A common mistake of investors is to put money in an account without a lot of thought as to the goals you want to achieve. Starting an investment fund without goals is like driving in a car with no destination in mind. Without a purpose for the money, it is impossible to measure the success or failure of the investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start Early with a Time Horizon</strong>. Starting early gives your money more time to grow. The longer the money is invested, the better it can weather market fluctuations and the more likely you are to successfully reach your goals. Along these same lines, set specific goals around a time horizon. How long will each bucket of money be invested? This is a very important piece to your overall strategy because it will help evaluate the specific investments that will be most beneficial. If you are 15 years away from your goal, investment choices will be much different than if you are 5. The closer you get to the destination, the less able you are weather market fluctuations. This should be considered in your overall strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increase The Amount Invested Each Year</strong>. When looking over your investment strategy, separate the performance and the contributions. The performance is how much your money has grown through your investment strategies. Contributions are the dollar amount that you have added to your investment accounts. These two factors make up the total growth of your portfolio. Both of these numbers are important to your overall strategy. The account performance should be reviewed independent of contributions to help you stay on track with the right investment choices for your risk tolerance and time horizon. The amount you have added in contributions is what you have built into your budget for long term financial goals. When you increase those contributions each year, your account should grow significantly faster. Small increases are often not felt in the monthly budget.Let’s say you currently contribute <strong>6%</strong> from your paycheck into your <strong>401k</strong>. In addition to that you are putting $50 a month into your IRA and <strong>$50</strong> a month into a  college fund. At the beginning of the year, increase your 401k contribution by<strong> 1%</strong>. Now you are putting away<strong> 7%</strong> in pretax dollars for retirement. Then the next quarter increase your IRA contribution to <strong>$75</strong> a month and the quarter after that, increase your college fund contributions by <strong>$25</strong> a month. These small increments will barely be noticed in your monthly budget. The <strong>$25</strong> a month increase is less than <strong>$1</strong> a day. If you are earning <strong>$50,000</strong> a year, the<strong> 1% i</strong>ncrease with your 401k is only around $21 a paycheck if you get paid bi-monthly, in pretax dollars. Meaning your paycheck will be reduced by less than $20 a paycheck due to the pretax allocation. If you increase the contribution at the time of your annual raise, it will only be noticed in the form of larger investment accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review your asset allocation as a whole picture</strong>. When you have separate investments for different financial goals, it is more of a challenge to see your portfolio in a complete picture. Having investments with different companies can increase these challenges. When you have a 401k at a current job, and maybe one or two from previous jobs, they are more difficult to keep up with. Then you might have current investments for retirement, college and savings for your first home. Taking a holistic view of all your investments will help to ensure you have the best asset allocation possible. When your allocation gets out of whack, you might end up taking on more risk than you are comfortable with, without realizing it. It is not always possible to have all your investments under one roof, especially with a current 401k. However, including these investments in all financial reviews will help you stay on track for your overall investment goals as well as ensuring your asset allocation and risk profile are appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Understanding what you can control</strong>. In life we like to have control over our current and future destinations. Happiness and success often come from recognizing what we can control and focusing on that. Investing is no different. We cannot control the markets and we cannot control the economy. There is a host of circumstances and events that are outside of our control. Stressing and worrying about those things is not beneficial. You can control spending and investment rate. You can control which investments you choose and the amount of risk in your portfolio. Staying focused on these elements will lead to higher comfort levels which will encourage staying the course.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Financial investing success has more to do with implementing sound strategies, rather than luck or great market timing. It is more about staying the course, than picking the <strong>“hot”</strong> stock that will make you a millionaire.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/customized-financial-portfolio-construction/\">Investment Management services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">Tips for Millennials to Understanding the Stock Market</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dollar-cost-averaging/\">What is Dollar Cost Averaging?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-things-investors-get-wrong/\">5 Things Investors Get Wrong</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1082064-121814</strong></p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"e3884356-ed87-5610-9ff3-2963cec32a32","slug":"guide-to-buying-your-first-home","title":"Guide To Buying Your First Home","content":"<h3>Guide to Buying Your First Home</h3>\n<p>With interest rates still low, down payment requirements easing, and the housing market picking up steam, many potential buyers that have been on the fence, are starting to jump into the housing market. A home is generally the most expensive purchase you will make. Is now the right time to purchase your first home? Here are a few ideas to help guide the decision:</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate your current circumstances.</strong> A few questions to consider include: Do you plan to be in the area for 5 years or more? What would your mortgage payment be in relation to current rent? How long does it take the average home to sell? Is the housing market on an upward trend?</p>\n<p>• A good rent versus buy calculator can be found at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" title=\"Realtor.com Rent Or Buy Calculator\" href=\"http://www.realtor.com/mortgage/tools/rent-or-buy-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Realtor.com</strong></a></span></span><br />\n• Remember a house is both an investment and a home. The housing market will fluctuate. As a long term investment, you must be aware, if you need to sell quickly, can result in selling it for less than desired. A booming market can provide quick sales for a profit.<br />\n• The cost of home ownership is more than just the mortgage payment. There are maintenance costs, taxes, insurance and sometimes homeowner’s dues that need to be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Assess Your Finances.</strong> Have a good understanding of what your assets and liabilities are, and how your credit looks should be included. Meeting with a financial advisor and a lender before applying will help you evaluate your finances.</p>\n<p>• Speak with a lender about which programs you may qualify for. This will determine the down payment needed, the price range of homes you qualify for, and estimated monthly payments.<br />\n• Pull your credit report. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" title=\"Annual Credit Report\" href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>AnnualCreditReport.com</strong></a></span></span> offers a free credit report from all three credit bureaus.

Is it better to make a higher down payment, pay down debt to get your debt to income ratios lower, or leave the money invested so the lender includes this in your financial reserves? Each decision has its own merits and between the lender and your Sherman Wealth Management adviser they can help you determine the best course of action for your needs.<br />\n• Consider what you can afford. What a lender will approve you for and how much you can afford may not be the same thing. Take a close look at all your financial obligations. Being house poor and unable to save for emergencies, retirement, college or other financial goals can create a stressful situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Get a Preapproval.</strong> Once you have evaluated your finances and determined a loan program, you are ready for a pre-approval. Your chosen lender will provide this. There are two levels of pre-approval.</p>\n<p>• The loan officer can review your financial information and credit. The loan officer then makes an assessment on how much home you can buy, what down payment is required and the best loan program. He/she then provides a preapproval letter.<br />\n• The second option includes an underwriting review of your completed file. They evaluate your income, credit, and financial assets before providing a letter. Ultimately, an underwriter makes the final decision on whether a loan is granted so the second step carries more weight than the first. Having an underwriter review your file, however, may require application fees and other costs to be paid up front.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact a real estate agent</strong> and find your first home. This is the fun part of the process. Many buyers start their search online to help narrow down location and potential neighborhoods. This can save time giving you a sense of where you want to live and what is available in your price range.</p>\n<p>When searching for your home, keep these points in mind:</p>\n<p>• You can change a lot about a home, but not its location. Be sure you are within an acceptable commute to work, schools and other activities that you will be involved in on a regular basis.<br />\n• While you will be living in your home and enjoying all its features, there will come a time you will want to sell, so consider resale value in your decision.<br />\n• Do not buy the most expensive home in the neighborhood.<br />\n• The best bargains are fixer uppers. While these homes are priced lower to compensate for needed work, it takes both time and money to make repairs. Consider how you want to use your financial resources. It is sometimes better to buy a move in ready home than to use all your cash reserves on repairs.</p>\n<p>Buying a home is an exciting decision. It can result in a solid investment that appreciates over time, though this is not guaranteed. Homeownership gives you a sense of community and allows you to personalize your space in a way that renting does not. Use these tips to determine if buying a home now, is the best decision for you and your family.</p>\n<p>LFS-1061220-111714</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"3280fdbc-d2d6-5a0d-8d70-58d62da24d8b","slug":"mitigating-your-investment-volatility","title":"Mitigating Your Investment Volatility","content":"<p>Volatile markets can be unsettling. You work hard for your money and even losing money on paper, to market fluctuations, can make you want to put all your cash under the mattress. In reality most investments will have volatility. Fixed rate products like CD’s may not have volatility, but will have their own risk of not keeping up with inflation. Currently 1 year CD’s are paying around 1%, and 5 year CD’s are only paying around 2%, according to <a href=\"Bankrate.com\">Bankrate</a>. This makes it necessary to have investments in your portfolio, which will fluctuate in value, in order to potentially have the needed funds to pursue your financial goals.</p>\n<p>With inflation averaging <strong>3.22%</strong> per year from 1913 to 2013², it is easy to see that establishing an investment portfolio that provides higher returns than inflation is essential to any long term plan. Investors look to mitigate the risk of the volatile markets, while seeking a return that will build investment values.</p>\n<p>For all its Bull and Bear markets, runs and crashes, stock market investments in the last 100 years has been positive when looking at any 10 year period from 1903 to December 1912³. The average stock market return since 1932 is around <strong>7%</strong> and when inflation is taken into account the average return is over <strong>10%</strong>⁴. So while the markets do go up and down on a daily basis, the overall market pattern has a consistent upward trend. However, past performance is not indicative of future results and your investments selection(s) and time horizon will affect your results.</p>\n<h3>Investing With Your Risk Tolerance in Mind</h3>\n<p>Investment risk, by definition, is the likelihood of losses in relation to an expected rate of return for a specific investment. All investments have some investment risk. The challenge for you is to determine which investments have risks you are willing to accept, and may be potentially rewarded with higher returns on a consistent enough basis.</p>\n<p>This is where a Sherman Wealth Management financial professional comes in. They work with you to determine a level of risk that is suitable for you and provide the potential growth needed to pursue your financial objectives. This requires not only understanding specific investments but also having a good pulse on what you, as an investor, need.</p>\n<p>In order to give the best advice, it is necessary to truly understand the client’s needs. Just asking, how much risk are you comfortable with, is not enough. Educating and teaching you about risk and what it may mean for your future, is the goal. This allows you to select investments that reflect your risk tolerance and financial aspirations.</p>\n<p>Taking a high level of personal interest in the changing needs of our clients is our goal. We believe this is the best strategy for maintaining an investment portfolio that is designed to have the appropriate amount of risk to pursue your financial goals, while striving to minimize the risk taken on individual investment choices.</p>\n<p>Each investor has individual needs and no investor’s taste for risk is the same. You need recommendations that take all of your circumstances and life goals into account. Added risk might lead to higher returns, but not always.</p>\n<p>If you have a lower tolerance for risk, building an investment portfolio that is designed to withstand market turmoil is more appropriate. These strategies still experience ups and downs, but the right blend of investments potentially moderate the fluctuations to align with your tolerance for risk.</p>\n<p>The stock market offers investments that carry various levels of risk. There are value, dividend paying stocks that have a lower volatility than emerging small cap stocks. Bonds are also available at various risk levels, allowing you to manage risk and performance within the portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Asset Allocation for Mitigating Volatility</h3>\n<p>Another method to help mitigate market risk and volatility is through Asset Allocation. This is the process of using several asset classes within an investment portfolio by apportioning a portfolio’s assets according to the individual goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stock market investments have the general categories of stocks and bonds.</p>\n<p>Stocks are broken down further between value stocks and growth stocks, with value generally being more conservative. Stocks that pay dividends are usually more conservative than stocks that do not, because investors are getting some return while they still hold the position. Stocks are also broken down by company size. These are denoted as large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks. Large cap stocks include companies like Microsoft, Apple, Bank of America and national names we all recognize. Small cap companies are those with 300 million to 2 billion in revenue, and mid-caps are between these two. The last large category is US companies and International or global companies.</p>\n<p>Bonds are rated much like individual credit is rated. There are consumers that are a much lower risk than others and this is measured through individual credit scores. Bonds operate in a similar way. There are independent credit agencies like<strong> S&amp;P</strong> and, Moody’s which rate company bond offerings. Bond ratings are expressed as letters ranging from &#8216;<strong>AAA</strong>&#8216;, which is the highest grade, to &#8216;C&#8217; (&#8220;<strong>junk</strong>&#8220;), which is the lowest grade. Different rating services use the same letter grades, but use various combinations of upper- and lower-case letters to differentiate themselves. Lower ratings represent higher default risk and thus higher interest rates to investors.</p>\n<p>Selecting the best mix of stocks and bonds is a delicate balance. Spreading your investments choices across different categories may provide an effective way to reduce the overall volatility of a portfolio. As the market fluctuates not all stocks and bonds move up and down at the same rate or the same time. When asset allocation is used correctly there is a designed buffer against losses and the overall risk of the portfolio should be reduced.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages of Dollar Cost Averaging</strong></p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed dollar amount on a regular schedule, regardless of the actual price of the stock, bond or other investment vehicle. There are several advantages to using this strategy.</p>\n<p>Smaller amounts can be invested providing potential benefits of growth over time. Time in the market is much more important than market timing and dollar cost averaging gets you in the market on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Buying more shares when the stock has a lower price and less shares when the price is higher. . Even the best companies will see stock prices fluctuate based on a current news reports, events that impacts the industry, or seasonal fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging helps reduce the risk of the overall portfolio because you are investing at regular intervals and buying more shares when the prices are low. This can be an effective way to grow your portfolio. Studies have shown that those who invest in regular intervals are more consistent with their investments, providing better overall growth, according to Morningstar⁵.</p>\n<p>Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.</p>\n<p>Financial strategies require a long term strategy. As such, volatility must be considered in your investment choices. Avoiding volatility because of fear can result in negative returns, when adding the impact of inflation. Working with a financial professional who understands volatility and uses strategies designed to enable you to build a portfolio which is suitable to your risk tolerance.

There are three major ways in which men and women differ when it comes to behavioral investing.</p>\n<p><strong>Investment Goals and Strategies:</strong> According to the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/\">Wall Street Journal</a>, finance professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, women tend to focus more on longer-term, non-monetary goals. Women generally associate money with security, independence and the quality of their life and their families’ lives. Women have a <strong>‘safety first’</strong> mentality. Generally speaking, women are more inclined than men to wear seat belts, avoid cigarette smoking, floss and brush their teeth and make regular doctor visits. They even have been shown to be<strong> 40%</strong> less prone than men to run yellow traffic lights. Men, on the other hand, who tend to be more competitive and thrill-seeking by nature, often focus on the short-term track records of their portfolios, incurring larger overall returns, and tend to be more risk tolerant. In contrast, women tend to be more averse to risk and are more skeptical. When it comes to investing and planning for their future, women shy away from uncertainty and will take a longer time to make investment decisions, are more methodical in how they go about research, and ask more questions.</p>\n<p>Both men and women should make sure that their investment styles and horizons match their overall financial goals. For women, this may mean taking on more risk. As they become more familiar and understand the ups and down of the stock market they will naturally become more risk tolerant. For men, this may mean focusing more on longer-horizon goals, rather than on short-term trading track records and larger gains.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_307\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-307\" style=\"width: 245px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-307 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Women-Risk-Averse-245x300.png\" alt=\"Women Risk Averse\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-307\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prudential&#8217;s study Financial Experience &amp; Behaviors Among Women</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Learning Curve: </strong>A 2012-2013 Prudential study on women investors reveals that women are more receptive to financial research and advice than men. Women seek help more often. Men tend to enjoy learning on their own and take a more independent approach, like the internet,  while women prefer learning in a group setting. Women rely more on personal networks with friends, family, financial planners, and they take a networking approach to gathering information. They often require more of a financial advisor’s time and resources, but are looking for a trusted relationship to be established, one  they can rely on long term. Men, however,  prefer to teach themselves and are more self-directed learners, using the Internet (more often than women) to gather information and are more likely to claim they understand financial matters than women. In actuality,  knowledge levels are not high for either gender.</p>\n<p>Thus far, evidence does not support, however, whether one source of information or learning technique is more or less effective than another.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_311\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-311\" style=\"width: 957px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-311 size-full\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Information-Sources-Used-By-Men-Vs-Women.png\" alt=\"Information Sources Used By Men Vs Women\" width=\"957\" height=\"432\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-311\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Source: Women &amp; Investing, Gender differences in investment behavior. FINRA Report August 2006</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Confidence Factor:</strong> Women tend to be thorough and take more time to make decisions than men. Several studies, including a national survey by LPL Financial, show that women tend to research investments in depth before making portfolio decisions, and the process, as a result, tends to take more time. Women also tend to be more patient as investors and consult their advisors before adjusting their portfolio positioning, whereas men are more prone to market timing impulses. Men veer toward overconfidence while women lean towards indecisiveness and insecurity.</p>\n<p>Overconfidence can lead to taking too much risk. While women risk missing out on some investment opportunities in taking more time to make decisions, men’s generally higher impatience when it comes to seeing investment returns makes them more likely to attempt market timing, and prone to loss when the timing is off. Women are less afflicted than men by overconfidence, or the delusion that they know more than they really do and are more likely (than men) to attribute success to factors outside themselves, like luck or fate.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-318 size-large\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ledbury-Research-1024x255.png\" alt=\"Ledbury Research\" width=\"980\" height=\"244\" /></p>\n<p>Yet, taking too little risk, due to lack of confidence, can hurt your investment goals just as much as overconfidence. When it comes to investing for the long term, taking risk is not a luxury. Insecure investors can confine their results by investing too conservatively, nearly as much as their overeager counterparts could do by excessive trading and risk-taking.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, to help avoid rash decisions and market impulses, men may benefit from implementing a systematic investment strategy and a periodic, rather than continuous, review of their accounts and rebalancing. They may want to consider becoming even more open to professional financial advice. Women may also want to review the efficiency of their investment allocations across their portfolios to counter the negative impact of mental accounting. In addition, they may want to consider attending financial education seminars to help boost their confidence levels and ability to make timely, well-informed investment decisions.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_321\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-321\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-321 size-full\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Men-Vs-Women-Confidence-Level.png\" alt=\"Men Vs Women Confidence Level\" width=\"915\" height=\"415\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Women &amp; Investing, Gender differences in investment behavior.

Whether it’s the acronym, <strong>#YOLO</strong> (You only live once) or the older, maybe not-so-cool phrase, ‘Carpe Diem,’ we are constantly reminded that we should stop worrying about the future and focus on today. But when it comes to your finances, is society sending us a detrimental message?</p>\n<p>When addressing one’s plans for retirement, it is sometimes difficult to find a happy medium between the avoidance of financial responsibilities and the overwhelming, anxiety-inducing worry over one’s financial future. Below are two very common thought processes that I see often.</p>\n<p><strong>1) I am not worried about the future now, I’ll deal with it later</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our day-to-day pressing needs and our live-for-today goals become the priority and we cannot focus on or visualize what is not right in front of us. We tell ourselves, ‘I’ll do it tomorrow.’ Whether it’s not participating in a 401K because the extra monthly money is needed for utility bills or prolonging the start of a college savings fund for your child because you have mortgage payments to make, you are setting yourself up for a worrisome retirement.</p>\n<p>It is important that you stop and visualize, in vivid detail, a big retirement goal. Are you visualizing being able to enjoy the finer things in life or are you just hoping to maintain the lifestyle that you are living today? What details do you see when you make this visualization?</p>\n<p>Consider these important factors while you are visualizing:</p>\n<p><strong><em>If I continue at today’s rate-of-saving, what will my savings be at retirement?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I have children? Do I plan to have more children?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I plan to send my children to college?/Can I afford college tuition?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Do I own a home? Do I have a mortgage?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Have I planned for rising health concerns as I get older?</em></strong></p>\n<p>If something should happen to me, will my family be taken care of?/What kind of debt will they incur?</p>\n<p><strong>2.) I worry so much about my future financial position, that I sacrifice my daily happiness</strong></p>\n<p>Studies have shown that intense worrying about money or financial situations can affect many aspects of your life from mental health, to relationships, to career. When consumed with worry over your finances, it can inflict on your ability to focus thus creating a distraction and inability to enjoy the present.</p>\n<p>While it is important to plan for the future, it should not be so overwhelming that it interferes with one’s day-to-day abilities. Ask yourself:</p>\n<p><em><strong>What am I really worried about?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Is it something in my control? If so, am I taking the necessary steps?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>If it is not in my control, what steps can I take to ease my anxiety?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Do I have a financial advisor that can help to address financial concerns and alleviate unnecessary worry?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Whether you identify more with the first or second way of approaching your finances, or possibly somewhere in the middle, it is important to address your financial concerns with a trusted financial advisor. Unnecessary worry can cause you to feel paralyzed, out of control, and unable to make the right financial decisions concerning your retirement. However, failing to address future financial responsibilities, and avoidance altogether, can prove to be counterintuitive, creating anxiety and worry at a later date. Suddenly financial responsibilities show up at your door and you no longer have the option to ignore or put off. In taking small steps along the way, you can gain control of both your finances and your worry.</p>\n<p>Call Brad Sherman at <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Sherman Wealth Management</a> today and set up a no-cost financial consultation.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">Retirement Planning services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement/\">Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/finding-financial-independence/\">Finding Financial Independence</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/your-401k-program/\">Your 401K Program: A Little Savings Now Goes a Long Way</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-much-money-do-you-need-for-retirement/\">How Much Money do you Need for Retirement These Days?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"fhttp://www.shermanwealth.com/benefits-saving-early-for-retirement/\">The Benefits of Saving Early for Retirement</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/advantages-of-participating-in-your-workplace-retirement-plan/\">Advantages of Participating in Your Workplace Retirement Plan</a></p>\n<p>LFS-926223-051514</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"c535504b-da2d-5c46-b612-c113daf33feb","slug":"millennials-the-fiscally-conservative-generation","title":"Millennials: The Fiscally Conservative Generation","content":"<p>As the <a title=\"Millennials Wikipedia Page\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Millennial Generation</a> continues to get more work experience under their belt, statistics from a UBS Wealth Management <a title=\"UBS Survey Findings\" href=\"http://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth/misc/investor-watch.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survey</a> show that this generation is the most fiscally conservative generation since the Great Depression.

Navigating your finances after a TBI can be overwhelming and intimidating when there are different directions to take and so much information to digest.</p>\n<p>Finding the right financial professional to assist you and guide you on a path unique to your specific needs is important. The right partner will help individuals with TBI create a strategy to cope with the anxiety that often comes with managing one’s finances. With access to the right assistance, information, and tools, one can address financial concerns and develop a path to achieving financial stability. The assistance that is required depends on the distinct needs of the individual and can range from providing management of day-today financial affairs to creating and addressing goals to obtain present and future financial security and well-being.</p>\n<p>When looking for a money management professional, it is important to seek a collaborative partnership with someone who specializes in a fully customizable, personalized approach to managing finances, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Together, you can establish a tailored plan that is right for your financial situation.</p>\n<p>A money manager can provide you with the most relevant resources and tools to fit your unique goals, whether you need guidance to make your own financial decisions or a trusted partner to do so on your behalf.

In this same survey – the Envestnet Fiduciary Standards Study – 52 percent of investors did not believe that all financial advisors were bound to a standard requiring them to act in the client’s best interest. In the post-Great Recession era, these findings are exceedingly troublesome.</p>\n<p>Brad Sherman, president of Sherman Wealth Management, serving clients in the greater Washington, D.C. metro area, has built his practice around improving those statistics.</p>\n<p>Sherman is a big believer in full disclosure and complete transparency for his clients regarding his fees and how he works with their accounts. He’s also a big believer in total transparency from the client. “For the relationship to fully benefit the client, there has to be transparency on both sides of it,” Sherman said. “I have to provide a completely transparent structure so everyone knows what they are paying for what they are receiving – so that there are not any surprises to the client. On the other hand, the client has to fully disclose to me what their financial situation and goals are so I can make appropriate recommendations for them.”</p>\n<p>He doesn’t have a firm minimum for his clients and in reality, most of his clients wouldn’t fit into the advisor marketplace niche requiring a quarter of a million to start. The bulk of his clients are his peers – people ranging in age from 25 to 40ish – who are starting careers, marriages and families. They are at the beginning of the accumulation phase of savings plans and many are buying their first homes.</p>\n<p>“They are comfortable with me and with taking my advice, because I either have been just recently in the same situation or am still doing the same things they are,” Sherman said.</p>\n<p>He started Sherman Wealth Management in January 2013 after spending 12 years working in financial services for other firms. He also had just completed his master’s degree in quantitative finance from American University, and it seemed like the appropriate time to hang out his own shingle. Since then, Sherman has taken on 50 clients and and wishes to develop relationships with additional clients seeking affordable, tax-efficient and customized advice.</p>\n<p>Sherman said that his decision to become a registered representative with Lincoln Financial Securities Corporation Member SIPC gives him the flexibility to craft portfolios specifically matching the individual needs and goals of each client.</p>\n<p>“Not all clients are the same,” he said. “That is why we customize every solution. Some of the bigger companies get into trouble by putting people into cookie cutter molds that may not be right for them. By representing Lincoln Financial in a fee-based model, there is no pressure on me to sell something that is not suitable for any of my clients.”</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Financial Advisor services.</a></p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/money-conversation/\">Having the Money Conversation</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/top-10-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">Top 10 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</a></p>\n<p>LFS-949357-061714</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"7b134a09-8987-5da7-b207-1b05c3692960","slug":"whats-your-credit-score","title":"What’s your credit score?","content":"<p>Ok, while it may not be the most romantic pick-up line, there is something to be said for wanting to know a potential partner’s credit score. It’s the number that seems to follow you wherever you go and rears itself way more often than your SAT scores or your IQ score. While it’s something you may not think about often, it is always there. So you should be always be thinking about how to maximize your credit score. Your credit is a doorway to many aspects of your life. And if its not where it should be, those doors may remain locked.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Your Credit Score is important</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>With a higher credit score, you will be able to take advantage of lower interest on loans, pay less for credit, better deals on services and insurance and the opportunity to obtain better jobs and living spaces. Essentially, the higher your credit score, the less obstacles you will face in your day-to-day life.</li>\n<li>Renting or buying a home First things first, you need a place to live, right? Well, before you rent, a landlord will often pull your credit report before allowing you to sign a lease. If you are looking to buy and need a bank loan, mortgage lenders will not only run your credit report, but will put a great emphasis on it in order to protect themselves from possible default. You will also need insurance on your home. Insurance companies are likely to check your credit score to predict the likelihood of you filing insurance claims. Your credit score can affect your eligibility and your rates.</li>\n<li>Setting up utility accounts Once you have moved, now what? You need a phone, right? And cable? Well, what about electricity, garbage collection, and water? Yes, these are all accounts you will need to establish. If your credit score comes back too low, the utility companies may require a deposit in advance, or even a co-signer.</li>\n<li>Finding a job In some states, employers are allowed to pull credit reports. Although they need your consent, wouldn’t it take some of the pressure off of the interview process and finding employment if you knew your credit score was at a decent level?</li>\n<li>Financing a car Leasing a car is similar to leasing an apartment. Lenders want to be sure you will be able to pay your monthly bill. Not only will your credit report be checked for the lease, but also, again, for the auto insurance.</li>\n<li>Opening credit cards You are planning an upcoming vacation and want to open a credit card that allows you to earn miles. If your credit score is not up-to-par, most likely you will not be offered credit cards with these types of perks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours</strong></p>\n<p>There are different ranges of credit scores based on a mathematical equation that analyzes your credit reports which include factors like payment history, debt levels, age of accounts, income etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Typical Credit Score rankings</strong>: <em>Excellent: 750 plus Good: 700-749 Fair: 650-699 Poor: 600-649 Bad: 599 and below</em></p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s how to maximize your Credit Score</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay bills on time This is important. If you are late on your payments, not only will your credit score go down, but you will also most likely pay an unnecessary late fee which just adds to your debt balance</li>\n<li>Pay more than just the minimum When you pay only the minimum, you are only paying the interest instead of paying down the debt balance. Creditors notice this. If you are unable to make payments that are larger than the interest, look for balance transfer offers from other creditors that may allow you to roll your balance over (for a minimal fee-usually 3%) in order to receive a zero percent APR for a set period of time (usually 6 months to a year). That will hopefully give you the opportunity to pay down the balance. (the pros and cons of balance transfers will be another blog post at a later date)</li>\n<li>Apply for credit cards in moderation Although balance transfers are a possible option, make sure you don’t open too many credit cards at once. If you have balances on too many and continue to look for more, lenders will think you are credit-hungry and are a candidate for possible default.</li>\n<li>Keep your credit card balance at 20% of the available credit or lower The lower the better.</li>\n<li>Don’t close credit cards If you have paid off a credit card balance, do not close the account. A zero balance on the card will help boost your credit score. It shows good payment history and can help your debt ratio. And never close a card with an existing balance, as it will just drive your current score down.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-budgeting-and-saving/\">Budgeting and Savings planning</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/save-money-pay-debt/\">Save Money or Pay Down Debt</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LFS950937061914</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"dc928597-fc51-5b7c-91cb-c0b63f857aca","slug":"rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track-with-investments","title":"Rebalance Your Portfolio To Stay On Track With Investments","content":"<p>A drift portfolio 60% invested in stocks delivers risk comparable to a portfolio with greater market exposure, 80% invested in the stock market in the example of Figure III-2.

When it’s time to retire, your goal should be to have saved at least eight times your ending salary. These numbers aren’t set in stone, but are good benchmarks to follow when starting your retirement savings and investment plan.</p>\n<p>Dependable advice in a fluctuating market.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/what-is-retirement-planning/\">Retirement Planning services</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/four-things-entrepreneurs-can-now-save-retirement/\">Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/finding-financial-independence/\">Finding Financial Independence</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/you-only-live-once-retirement-goal/\">YOLO (You Only Live Once) so you Need a Retirement Goal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/your-401k-program/\">Your 401K Program: A Little Savings Now Goes a Long Way</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"fhttp://www.shermanwealth.com/benefits-saving-early-for-retirement/\">The Benefits of Saving Early for Retirement</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/advantages-of-participating-in-your-workplace-retirement-plan/\">Advantages of Participating in Your Workplace Retirement Plan</a></p>\n<p>Sherman Wealth Management</p>\n<p>LFS-821525-021914</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"e1928ac1-de58-51df-a2c2-a4fd0f450b5e","slug":"dimensional-funds-advisors","title":"Dimensional Funds Advisors","content":"<p>Early this year, Barron’s posted an article by Beverly Goodman on a program orchestrated by financial firm <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dimensional-fund-advisors-2/\">Dimensional Fund Advisors</a>, led by University of Chicago economist Professor Eugene Fama.

However, Millennials are anything but when it comes to their finances. According to Financial Finesse 2013 Generational Research Report, the tech savvy Millennials “continue to be stronger than their older Generation X counterparts in many areas of day to day money management.”</p>\n<p>Those under 30, commonly labeled the Millennial Generation, are doing a relatively good job managing their current cash flow on a day to day basis. In the age of the internet and now social media, technology is the leg up for Millennials. Accustomed to budget friendly websites, comparison shopping, and peer comparison, Millennials use what they have at their fingertips to do their own research and ensure they are getting the best deals. So when it comes to short term cash flow, Millennials’ top priority is making sure they have more money coming in than going out.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the availability of parental support from the baby boomers (ages 45-65) has steadily increased in recent years, as 30% of young adults (ages 18 to 34) that are employed full time live with their parents or have moved back home temporarily. Thus giving Millennials extra time to build savings.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Strengths</strong></p>\n<p>73% have a handle on cash flow<br />\n88% are paying their bills on time each month<br />\n62% are regularly paying off their credit card balances in full<br />\n52% check their credit rating on an annual basis.</p>\n<p>However, although Millennials may not be sitting on the same amount of debt as their older counterparts, they tend to overlook a long term perspective that makes planning for retirement a top priority. According to the same Financial Finesse study, Millennials “suffer from a relative lack of investment knowledge” making long term financial goals their biggest challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Weaknesses</strong></p>\n<p>Only 67% say they have a general knowledge about investments<br />\nOnly 37% have taken a risk tolerance assessment<br />\nOnly 29% rebalance their investments<br />\nOnly 83% are contributing to their retirement plan at work<br />\nOnly 29% have run a retirement projection<br />\nOnly 17% say they are on track to replace 80% of their income in retirement<br />\nOnly 26% contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA<br />\nOnly 29% are confident their investments are allocated appropriately</p>\n<p>To get Millennials on track, they need to bring their long‐term goals into focus. This generation favors the opinions and advice of peers and first‐hand users over those of traditional experts. Seventy‐five percent have created a profile on a social network and are more likely than any other generation to visit the website several times a day. Finding a way to incorporate a social platform with an educational platform allowing Millennials to share their experiences, with hands‐on applications, as well as testimonials and peer recommendations, will resonate well with this generation as they believe the classroom is a thing of the past. Thirty-nine percent of Millennials see the future of education as more virtual.</p>\n<p>Gen X</p>\n<p>Generation X, ages 30-44, is considered the more self-reliant generation. They are the first generation to grow up with both parents working outside the home and have had independence and freedom at a young age compared to other generations. That, coupled with being the first generation to grow up with computers, has given Gen X the ability, as well as the need, to control their own lives, including their financial goals.</p>\n<p>Gen Xers, on average, have a higher income than their younger counterparts and tend to be homeowners and/or married with a dual household income. However, this generation was hit the hardest by the Great Recession, losing quite a bit of their savings, most significantly when the housing market collapsed. This creates a struggle for Gen X in prioritizing their financial responsibilities. This group is paying down debt from their self-reliant 20’s but with more immediate obligations, such as mortgage payments and young children, it becomes difficult to balance. Those more immediate expenses tend to seek priority over their day to day cash flow.</p>\n<p>What holds Gen X back is not their desire to save, but rather their debt that hangs on them like a noose around their necks. Forty-nine percent have debt that keeps them from saving for emergencies, children’s college tuition and ultimately retirement.</p>\n<p>During the financial crisis: *</p>\n<p>15% of Generation X made early withdrawals from their retirement accounts<br />\n23% stopped contributing to those retirement accounts<br />\n22% stopped contributing to college accounts</p>\n<p>* 2012 report by the Insured Retirement Institute.</p>\n<p>It may help Generation X to be aware of the vast number of available college financing options. Those options make saving for college a lower priority than saving for their own goals like retirement, an emergency fund, and of course, paying off debt. It is important they learn to balance competing demands and meet long term goals while faced with immediate growing priorities.</p>\n<p>Gen X’ers rely heavily on education and take advantage of tools that are made available to them. One tool this age group has taken advantage of, and had a high level of confidence in, is the stock market, which may be why they are struggling to meet their long term goals. Many Gen X’ers largely missed the huge run up in stock prices in the 80’s and 90’s, and may need more aggressive retirement investment strategies or alternatives to compensate. They understand the importance of investing and are not afraid to do so aggressively.</p>\n<h3>Both generations need to be realistic about their finances</h3>\n<p>Both generations view “old age” at somewhere around 78 or 80 and the life expectancy of a current 60 year old, according to government statistics, has reached a record 84 years. But with both Gen Xers and Millennials facing the impending shortfalls of Medicare and Social Security, how will either generation prepare accordingly? This, combined with the reduction in employer‐sponsored retirement benefits, makes both groups subject to suffer shortfalls in their own savings unless drastic measures are taken.</p>\n<p>Both generations have had some help from the Baby Boomers along the way—whether through life insurance, college savings or financial support post college. But are either the Millennials or Gen X’ers going to have the ability to do the same for their own children?</p>\n<p>Although Gen X may not have as much time as Millennials for their savings to compound and grow, the silver lining is both generations have time on their side. But time is money, right?

When it comes to saving for retirement, there are few better ways than a workplace plan such as a 401(K). Yet, there are a few common excuses for not opting into an employer compensation plan.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">● There will always be Social Security<br />\n● I can’t afford it right now. I’m not making enough money to save yet.<br />\n● Fear of losing money in bad investments.<br />\n● I’m so young, I have all the time in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>The 411 about the 401(K)</strong><br />\nA 401K allows employees to withdraw money from their paycheck prior to taxes and invest it in a retirement savings plan. Many employers then match the contributions proportionately, sometimes even dollar for dollar. The contributions are not taxed until the money is withdrawn. As of 2014, you can contribute up to $17,500 per year.</p>\n<p>Funds withdrawn prior to age 59 ½ are subject to a 10% penalty and are taxed as current income in the year withdrawn.</p>\n<p><strong>A Mini History Lesson about Pensions and Employer Compensation Plans</strong><br />\nIt was during the American Revolution, that what we know as a pension, came about. The Continental Congress offered soldiers a monthly lifetime income as an incentive to join General Washington’s army.The income they’d receive when the war was over would be a payment for their service.This lifetime income was called a pension.The offer was repeated by the federal government the during the Civil War and has continued ever since.</p>\n<p>The first private company to offer a pension plan was American Express in 1875. They gave an income to each retired employee. The amount was equal to half of the worker’s annual pay, based on an average of the worker’s final ten years of employment (up to $500 annually). Over the next 50 years, hundreds of other companies created similar plans. (However, now it’s based on the average of the worker’s highest paid income of 35 years!)</p>\n<p>The end of 1929 brought the Great Depression. Millions of people became unemployed which created fierce competition for jobs.The nation’s economy at the time was agricultural and industrial— both very physically demanding— placing older Americans at a distinct disadvantage. So when older employees lost their jobs, they were unlikely to find new ones and found themselves involuntarily retired.</p>\n<p>Thus, in 1935 came the Social Security Act which was signed by President Roosevelt,establishing the first public retirement plan and a national retirement age of 65.Similar to the private plan created by American Express, Social Security was to pay monthly benefits based on each worker’s length of service and average annual salary.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong>Addressing the Excuses</strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong><em>There will always be Social Security<br />\n</em></strong>When the Social Security Act was established, the average American lifespan was 61.7 years, however, today it is 78 years. Now, one must plan income for retirement to get you to age 100 or beyond. You can no longer solely rely on Social Security alone to maintain you through your retirement years. It should only provide you with one-third of your retirement income.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">Few companies still maintain traditional pensions (paid for by employers). In this day and age, people are no longer staying at one place of employment for their entire career which is usually the case in which a pension would still exist. The vast majority of today’s retirement plans fall under “defined contribution plans” such as the 401(K).</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong><em>I can’t afford it right now. I’m not making enough money to save yet.<br />\n</em></strong>You do not have to make a lot of money to participate in this program. Typically an employer only requires 1-2% of the participant’s salary. On a $50K salary, that is only $42 to $84 per month. And remember, your employer may contribute proportionately every time you do. How much do you spend on your cable bill? Or phone bill? Or your gym?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">Your employer automatically deducts your contributions every time you are paid. If you don’t see the money, it won’t be so hard to part with it! Most of the legwork to provide investment options is done by your employer and the professional advisers they hire to assist them. An increasing number of plans offer “auto enroll” and “auto escalate” features. The first automatically signs you up for your retirement plan; the second automatically boosts contributions as your salary increases.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">Another perk: You get two tax advantages when you save in a 401(K) plan. First, your contributions are tax-deductible. Second, the money you contribute doesn’t count toward your gross income for the year, lowering your taxable income. There are also no taxes on interest or dividends at the end of the year like in a non qualified investment or savings. Say you put 10% of your $50,000 salary into your account each month. That’s $416 you don’t have to pay tax on. If you’re single, that translates to about $104 in monthly tax savings, or $1,245 a year and tax deferred until its withdrawn.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong><em>Fear of losing money in bad investments.<br />\n</em></strong>Sometimes taking your hard earned money and putting it where you can’t see it is scary. People who have fear of going to the doctor but have to go anyway. Think of it the same way. Most 401(k)s let the employee choose where to invest their savings from a variety of options ranging from aggressive choices as to less volatile choices.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><em><strong>I’m so young, I have all the time in the world.<br />\n</strong></em>The key to success of a 401(K) is to start as early as possible and to try and contribute the maximum allowed. According to FinancialSamurai.com, in 2014, if a 22 year old started participating in a 401(K) by the time they are 65, they will have saved $743K to $3.5 million, depending on the percentage of contributions to the plan. But if someone does not start contributing until age 40, by the time they are 65, they will have saved $305.5K to $550K, depending on the percentage of contributions to the plan. Wouldn’t you prefer to be the former?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\"><strong>Don’t leave money on the table.

Some say it’s too overwhelming to think about. But even young, healthy adults can unexpectedly fall to illness or become involved in an accident. Ask yourself these questions:</p>\n<p>&#8211; What would happen to my child if I and my spouse suddenly died or became incapacitated?</p>\n<p>&#8211; Who will take care of your child&#8217;s medical needs and daily care?</p>\n<p>&#8211; Who will manage your assets until your child reaches adulthood?</p>\n<p>A well-crafted estate plan can both address these issues and ensure that your kids are taken care of after you are gone. That is precisely the reason young families <em>need</em> estate planning. After all, let’s not forget what happened <a href=\"https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2018/10/05/dont-let-your-clients-make-the-same-mistake-as-are/\">when Prince passed</a> with no will or estate plan in place. While most believe estate planning to be a simple routine, there are actually many things to consider when planning for the future:</p>\n<p><strong>Nominate a guardian for your children</strong></p>\n<p>As a parent of a child or multiple children, the top reason as to why you need an estate plan is to allow for the specific naming of the person who will continue to raise the children. If this is not named, the court will appoint someone. This person will not know your children, nor will they know your wishes for the future of each child.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions for the distribution of your assets</strong></p>\n<p>Typically, married couples want a majority of their assets to go to the surviving spouse if one of them was to pass away. If both parents die and the children are young, they want their assets to be used to care for their children.</p>\n<p><strong>Naming Someone to Manage Your Children’s Inheritance</strong></p>\n<p>As with guardian status, unless you specifically name someone, the court will appoint someone to oversee the inheritance going to your children. This will likely be a stranger to your family. Further, it will cost money, which will be paid from the inheritance. Most parents ask that their children inherit the assets when they are older. This allows the inheritance to stay “intact” and provide for all children under the age of 18.</p>\n<p><strong>Reviewing Insurance Needs</strong></p>\n<p>A main component of the planning process is to evaluate the amount of life insurance on both parents. Obviously, Income will need to be replaced in the loss of one, or both, parents. Additional coverage may be needed to provide for your children until they are of legal age. This amount could go up more if you wanting to pay for college for these children</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Estate planning will require you to ponder over relationships and life. This may very well lead to some difficult decisions. But a qualified financial advisor will be able to help you through this process. They can also provide valued direction and ensure your plan will do what you want if the time comes. If finances are tight, which is normal for young families, we suggest starting with the most critical legal documents and life insurance. Other aspects of the plan can be decided when the time is right. In the end, the most important thing is to not put this off. Once your plan is settled, this will bring you and your family a great deal of peace and comfort.</p>\n<p>We meet with lots of young couples and have encountered countless one-off, complex scenarios. To further assistance with your planning, we can refer you to a few select lawyers we work with in the DC Metro area.

There seems to be so much worry out there. “Have I waited too long?” Of course, when it comes to the largest financial purchase of your life, it’s totally normal to be hesitant. After 2007, no one wants to buy real estate if they feel we are on the verge of a downswing in housing prices and/or rates. However, this attitude somewhat surprises me. Why?

Many other factors must be accounted for when purchasing a home in order to get the “full picture”. From talking with CPAs and other professionals in there area, we are discovering that Wealthy households. are much more focused on the loss of the SALT deduction than what interest rate they may receive on their next real estate purchase.</p>\n<p>Another main factor, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which was passed in 2018, will have a big impact on those who are looking to purchase real estate, particularly in the DC Metro. Why is this? Because of the changes in state and local tax (SALT) deductions, which are now capped at $10,000. In states like Maryland, where high state income taxes will eat up most of the SALT deduction, the cap is likely to affect homebuying decisions, as prospective home purchasers seek to minimize their property taxes. The <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/how-taxpayers-dc-and-its-suburbs-would-fare-under-new-tax-law\">variations become greater</a> for taxpayers with annual income between $100,000 and $200,000. Generally, households in the Maryland counties tend to benefit less from the TCJA than those in Virginia largely because Maryland has higher combined state and county taxes. In fact, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/taxes/trumps-plan-to-eliminate-the-state-and-local-tax-deduction-explained\">a whopping 45.04% of Maryland tax returns included a deduction</a> for state and local taxes in 2014. That’s the highest percentage of returns claiming SALT deductions of any state. The average size of those deductions was $12,442.78.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, if you’re worried about interest rates having an impact on the “all-in” cost of your next (first?) real estate purchase, you’re forgetting about another large factor: SALT deductions. And since the environment has changed drastically for states like Maryland, these calculations should be a part of your due diligence and planning.

The most common debate revolves around the 15-year versus the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. With interest rates near all-time lows, there have been many recent articles outlining different sides of this debate. One in particular that caught my attention was this <a href=\"http://www.time.com/money/4443932/15-year-mortgage-advantages/\">article</a> from Time quoting financial experts about why a 15-year mortgage can potentially make more sense than a 30-year mortgage.</p>\n<p>Let me preface this by saying every situation is going to be different, and that the following considerations are based on the current interest rate environment. Let’s look at the arguments made and examine why the psychological component of a 15-year mortgage may be advantageous to some, but the mathematical evidence shows us otherwise.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 1 for a 15-year mortgage: Save More Money</h2>\n<p><em>“Taking out a 15-year mortgage dramatically cuts your home-loan repayment time. The faster you repay the loan, the less in interest you need to pay. This can save you tens of thousands of dollars over the (shorter) life of your loan. A 15-year mortgage also usually offers better interest rates than other loan products,&#8221; says Debbie Todd, a CPA.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong></p>\n<p>The problem with this is that interest rates are now hovering right around the range of inflation (around 4% or lower). Assuming you would invest in the stock market with the excess money you’d be saving on monthly payments by acquiring a 30-year mortgage rather than a 15-year mortgage, and assuming recent average historical returns, your money can do far better for you in that manner. Let&#8217;s take a look at an example of Jordan and Matt, each of whom wants to get a $400,000 mortgage. For this example, we will make it simple by assuming there is no down payment on the house.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage1.png\" /></p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>*<a href=\"http://bretwhissel.net/cgi-bin/amortize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://bretwhissel.net/cgi-bin/amortize</a></em></h5>\n<p>Matt is paying $996.15 less than Jordan per month. Let’s say that Matt invests that full amount in the stock market each month which historically has returned 8% annually depending on the time period you look at (we will also look at it with a more conservative 6% and 4% rate of return). With these assumptions, Matt’s investment account will be worth:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage2.png\" /></p>\n<p>Not convinced by these numbers? Try out a free online <a href=\"https://investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator\">compound interest calculator</a>. So now let’s add that amount to the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a> Matt has in his house after five, 10 and 15 years and compare it to Jordan&#8217;s investment.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage3.png\" /></p>\n<p><em>** Using 8% annual rate of return. See chart above for other rates of return such as 4% and 6%.</em></p>\n<p>As you can see, as time goes on, the difference only gets greater. By the time Jordan has paid off his house in full, Matt will have accumulated $193,451.13 more equity that Jordan. Of course, if interest rates go up substantially, this analysis changes, but given the current market, it looks like Matt’s course is the wiser one.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 2 for a 15-Year Mortgage: Build More Equity</h2>\n<p><em>“When you repay your mortgage faster, you don’t just save money — you build equity in your home faster too. Combine a shorter mortgage term with rising home prices, and you could exponentially grow the amount of equity you have.&#8221; </em></p>\n</div>\n<p><i>&#8220;This is beneficial for several reasons, especially if you want to refinance the loan down the road. “Since you are paying principal faster with a 15-year note,” explains Therese R. Nicklas, CFP, “you will be building equity faster, making refinancing potentially easier.” With a smaller loan-to-value ratio, the risk you present to your lender will be smaller, so you should have more financial opportunities.&#8221;</i></p>\n<p>The argument here is that by repaying the loan faster, you not only save money on the lifespan of the loan, you also build equity in the home faster.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong></p>\n<p>The problem with this is that a home is not an investment, in the truest sense of the term. We say that because of the carrying costs that come with purchasing a home. Most investments don’t require ongoing investments. Between your mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities and general maintenance, these ongoing expenses will at a minimum partially offset the amount of market value the house could theoretically gain over the course of your ownership.</p>\n<p>We constantly preach the importance of diversification. For the vast majority of first time home buyers, the home is far and away their most valuable asset. By accelerating your mortgage, in this scenario, you are putting an enormous percentage of your net worth into one asset, which is contrary to the notion of prudent diversification. Even worse? Your home is not a liquid asset. It’s not like investing in other assets such as the stock market, where if a crisis occurred you would be able to sell your investment and get the funds. You can’t just sell a house overnight.</p>\n<p>Even if there is a time period of deflation, that doesn’t change the point that once your cash goes into a house, it is much harder to get out. In this type of scenario, you could always prepay your mortgage.</p>\n<p>To further explain this point, let’s look at how it would all play out after 30 years if Jordan decided to start investing the full amount of his mortgage payment after he finishes paying off his house in 15 years. At the same time, Matt will continue his monthly contribution for the remaining 15 years of his mortgage.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage4.png\" /></p>\n<p>That’s a difference of $528,750.10 over a 30 year period. To show you that this works even at 4%, here&#8217;s the comparison with that rate of growth:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/15year_vs._30year_/bsherman_mortgage5.png\" /></p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 3 for a 15-year mortgage: Reduce Pressure on Your Monthly Budget in Retirement</h2>\n<p><em>“Getting a 15-year mortgage might help if you plan to retire in the next 10 to 20 years. Many people want to downsize before they retire, and that means buying a new home. “Choosing a 15-year mortgage allows you to reduce the strain on your cash flow in retirement,” says Eric Roberge, a financial planner.&#8221;</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><em>“You can take advantage of stronger cash flow while you’re working to make the bigger monthly payments that a 15-year mortgage requires and pay off the loan before you retire,” Roberge says. “Then, when you do retire, you won’t have to pull as much out of your savings to cover living expenses since your loan will be gone.”</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong></p>\n<p>While we agree with the general concept here, we want to make sure people understand there are other costs associated with owning a home than just the mortgage. There is no doubt a physiological advantage to reducing the pressure on your budget in retirement but as we aim to point out, the math doesn’t always support that in full.</p>\n<p>You still have to pay for taxes, insurance, upkeep and repairs. Another issue we have is that we are neither factoring in inflation nor the other expenses that come with owning a home. Expenses such as insurance and taxes will continue to increase with inflation. At the same time, as I allude to above, when you factor in inflation, your housing payment actually gets cheaper each year in real dollars.</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Argument 4 for a 15-year Mortgage: Take Advantage of Built-in Discipline</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;Instead of considering 15-year mortgages, some people take out a 30-year mortgage and simply accelerate the payments they make on that loan. They get the benefit of saving money on interest but aren’t tied to the higher monthly payment. But Todd Tresidder, a money coach, explains that while this sounds good, the situation isn’t always so simple. “If your intention is to pay off the mortgage in 15 years, then commit to it,” he says. “You may prefer the flexibility of a lower mortgage payment by getting a 30-year loan, and you may honestly have the best intentions to add principal to pay it off in 15 years anyway.”</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><em>&#8220;However, many people just don’t follow through with that plan. It’s too easy to fall back on making the smaller, easier payment and using the extra payment money for other purchases instead. “Without the enforced discipline of the required payment, it won’t happen,” says Tresidder. “So just be honest with yourself.”</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Why we disagree…</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you don’t have the discipline to pay off your monthly expenses then you should rethink whether it makes sense to buy real property at this time. If, on the other hand, you are confident that you can hold yourself accountable to paying off your monthly expenses, why not afford yourself more flexibility? You can always pay off a 30-year fixed mortgage in 15 years, but you can’t do the reverse. (For related reading, see <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/got-a-raise-heres-how-to-avoid-lifestyle-creep/\"><em>Got a Raise? Here’s How to Avoid Lifestyle Creep</em></a>)</p>\n<div class=\"no-break\">\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>In summary, we agree that doing something for psychological reasons — as well as to achieve a sense of security and fiscal prudence — has merit. Having said that, by understanding the interest rate market and the pros and cons of home mortgage schedules, you may rethink the psychology of the idea that 15-year mortgages are wiser than 30-year mortgages. It pays to recognize that there are additional factors that may turn this debate in another direction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/093016/15year-vs-30year-mortgages-comparison/\">Investopedia.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
