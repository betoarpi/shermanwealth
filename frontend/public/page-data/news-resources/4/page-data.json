Now reality has set in.</p>\n<p>As with all market corrections, this one has inspired retail investors to question whether it’s time to pull money out, shift to safer and more stable investments or just throw in the towel entirely.</p>\n<p>While it is normal to feel anxiety during a downturn, there’s another way to look at it. As long as downturns and dips don’t affect your financial plan or, more specifically, your immediate need for cash, they can be an opportunity.</p>\n<p>Remember the mantra “buy low and sell high”? The volatility, geopolitical risk and uncertainty we’ve experienced so far in 2016 have presented a particular opportunity for investors in the accumulation stage of their lives, or for anyone who has money but hasn’t started investing yet, to actually buy low (or at least lower). If you’ve been delaying investing regularly because the “market was too high” or “you knew a correction was coming,” now might be a good time to start.</p>\n<p>The key is to view volatility — like what we experienced last August and what we are seeing now — as a tool to keep contributing regularly to your investments. This will let you maximize the possible potential for your investments and enable you to watch them grow. The two best concepts to help you do that are dollar-cost averaging and compounded interest.</p>\n<h3>Dollar-cost averaging</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/dollar-cost-averaging/\">Dollar-cost averaging</a> is the process of spreading out the costs of your investments as the market rises and falls, rather than purchasing shares all at one (potentially higher) price. The key is to pick a schedule — whether it’s monthly, bimonthly or weekly — and an amount, no matter how small, and stick to it by purchasing as many additional shares in your investments as your fixed amount will allow. This is much more effective than trying to “time” the market by buying shares when they are at their lowest or selling when they are at their highest.</p>\n<p>Using this system, you are regularly contributing the same amount, regardless of the price of shares. As a result, that fixed dollar amount buys more shares in times when the market has dropped and prices are low, and it limits the amount of shares when the market has risen and prices are high. Over time you will come out ahead, compared with trying to time the market.</p>\n<h3>Compound interest</h3>\n<p>Once you have started to build up the size of your investment with the help of dollar-cost averaging, the concept of <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/compound-interest-save-early/\">compound interest</a> gives you a boost. Compounded interest is the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment already has earned. If you have $1,000, for instance, and it earns 5% interest yearly, you will earn $50 at the end of the first year. Then, if you keep that money invested, the next year you will earn 5% interest on the total — $1,050 — which is $52.50. The following year, you will earn 5% on $1,102.50, which is a little more than $55.</p>\n<p>Because dips in prices allow you to buy more shares with a fixed amount, volatility allows you to maximize the potential for compound interest as well.</p>\n<p>Using these two concepts, the daily ups and downs and market corrections are not a cause for undue concern. If you are sticking to your dollar-cost averaging plan and taking advantage of compound interest, news events shouldn’t affect your long-term plans and goals. Any dollar that is invested in the stock market should be a dollar that you are comfortable keeping invested through a bear market or a major correction.</p>\n<p>If you are disciplined about investing, and consistent about reinvesting, you’ll start to look at market volatility as a tool and an opportunity, rather than as a source of anxiety or, worse, a reason to throw in the towel and lose out on long-term growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Economics is hard. Not in a &#8220;things are actually good today&#8221; way. But in mid-2008 surging oil prices and a falling dollar were a big headwind.”</p>\n<p>As a Financial Advisor, I read every piece of economic data available to me and follow the thought processes of the top thinkers at virtually all the key financial institutions so I can carefully invest money on behalf of our clients.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I’ve discovered: none of them, and none of us, have been given a roadmap to what the future holds. They can watch and study the relevant economic indicators, but they cannot predict the financial future with absolute certainty. We all live with uncertainty while trying to make the best decisions we can with the information available.</p>\n<p>Given the certainty of uncertainty, what can individuals do to best prepare for their financial future?</p>\n<p>With all of the speculation about the upcoming elections, questions about possible negative interest rates, and concerns about international instability, it’s easy to feel anxious about the potential effects on the economy and on your savings and investments. Particularly because the airwaves and the Internet are full of news reports, commentary, blogposts and Tweets about how volatile and risky the markets are.</p>\n<p>One thing that <em>is</em> certain: there will always be volatility and risk in the markets. That’s what makes the stock market the stock market. Even if we are currently experiencing a bit more than just normal market volatility, remember that the markets have historically rebounded extremely well after corrections (which are considered a drop of at least 10%). Don’t take my word for it, take a look at the chart below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2927\"><img class=\"wp-image-2927\" style=\"float: left; padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 10%; width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-300x181.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.10 AM\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.28-AM.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2926\"><img class=\" wp-image-2926\" style=\"padding-right: 4%; width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.28-AM-300x182.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.28 AM\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2925\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2925 aligncenter\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-300x183.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.44 AM\" /></a></p>\n<p>These charts show 27 corrections of at least 10% or more since 1987. All of those corrections had one thing in common: they all rebounded with a bullish rally. What history has shown is that, over the long run, markets continue to move higher.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for individual savers and investors? No matter your age or experience with financial planning and investments, there is one universal “must” that applies to everyone. You need a financial plan:  a carefully thought-out, customized financial plan, not just something you downloaded from Google. Once you have that plan in place, the next steps are to implement it, then put your head down and trust in that plan.</p>\n<p>This current market in particular highlights the importance of having a financial plan that is both age-appropriate and risk-adjusted to your specific financial situation, goals, and needs. If you&#8217;re in your 20s or 30s, for instance, the correction we’re experiencing is a great opportunity. Why? Because you have the luxury of time on your side. With the market currently down significantly from where it was a year ago, this is a great time to implement a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=fed&amp;utm_campaign=dollar%20cost%20averaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dollar cost averaging</a> strategy and start saving and investing on a consistent basis.</p>\n<p>One of the things that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=fed&amp;utm_campaign=red%20pill%20or%20blue%20pill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">differentiates us at Sherman Wealth</a>, however, is that we believe that no two people are alike and that everyone’s investment strategy and portfolio should be customized to suit his or her individual situation, needs, and goals. We get to know each client – or potential client &#8211; so we can analyze their actual risk tolerance in a holistic way, rather than just plugging their age and one or two other factors into a simple, one-size-fits all algorithm the way some of the Robo-Advisor platforms do. Then we create a plan that is designed to work for our clients.</p>\n<p>I can’t tell you what the market is going to do tomorrow or six months from now – no one can. But with a well-thought-out financial plan &#8211; one that takes into consideration who you are now, where you want to be, and how much risk you can tolerate &#8211; you will feel much more confident about your own strategy and less likely to panic about what the next crazy pundit to pop up on the internet has to say.</p>\n<h6>Photo Source: AP</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

If you&#8217;re gluten-free, that means having a pantry already stocked with gluten-free pasta and a gluten-free loaf of bread in the freezer &#8211; not to mention beans, rice and tomato sauce &#8211; to tide you through the blizzard. It also means sticking to what you know has made sense for you in the past and realizing that two days without bread is not the end of the world &#8211; the bread will return to the shelves once the storm has passed.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if you know your risk tolerance and have already planned effectively, you&#8217;ll have a balanced portfolio that contains the right balance of stocks and other less volatile instruments <em>before</em> a storm hits. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-valeant-dilemma-how-diversified-is-your-diversification/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=gluten-free%20blog&amp;utm_campaign=diversification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">With a fully diversified asset allocation strategy,</a> there will be parts of your portfolio that go<br />\nup,<br />\nas well as other parts that go down, during times of stress. That way you&#8217;ll be comfortable sticking to your investment strategy and plan when the market is stormy. Plus, you&#8217;ll have purchased those less volatile instruments before pundits start shouting and everyone starts panic-purchasing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=gluten-free%20blog&amp;utm_campaign=red%20pill%20or%20blue%20pill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A good financial advisor will help you build a portfolio strategy</a> that truly for reflects your risk tolerance and, importantly, helps you understand <em>exactly where the risk is </em>in your portfolio. Your advisor will help you understand if, when and <em>why</em> to own bonds, Munis, Treasuries, and CDs, and how much of a cash component makes sense for your particular situation and need for liquidity.<strong><br />\n</strong><br />\nThe volatility we’re experiencing, current geopolitical uncertainty (like Japanese negative interest rates), and Federal Reserve uncertainty are all great litmus tests to determine whether you have a properly diversified portfolio and whether or not it&#8217;s an accurate match for your true risk tolerance.  If current market conditions or any paper losses you may be experiencing make you feel uncomfortable &#8211; or keeps you up at night &#8211; it&#8217;s likely that your investment strategy does <em>not</em> match your actual risk tolerance and needs to be re-balanced.</p>\n<p>If, however, you&#8217;ve worked with your financial advisor and are comfortable with where you, then you’re best bet is probably to ignore the noise, ignore the panicking pundits, and stick to your saving and investing plan. Remember, if your investments made sense to you a couple of weeks ago, they probably continue to make sense for you, even during market volatility.</p>\n<p>Just like a diversified pantry will help you stick to your nutritional goals when there&#8217;s a run on the supermarket, a good fee-only financial advisor can help you create a portfolio that is truly diversified, risk appropriate, and with the exact amount of liquidity that makes sense for your long-term goals, so you can sit back and weather the storm with confidence.</p>\n<h6>Photo Source: Reuters/Shannon Stapleton</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Are you wondering – given the rate increase and current market turmoil – if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now?</p>\n<p>Actually, the exact opposite happened. Rates actually fell from 2.3% to 1.55% on the US 10-year treasuries (a common indicator of how mortgage rates are priced), their lowest point since September 2012. If you already own a home with an ARM or 30-year fixed mortgage, this is also a good time to refinance or reduce debt at these low rates.</p>\n<p>Remember a house or condo is both a home <u>and</u> an asset that can appreciate over time. No matter what they’re saying on the news, what’s important is what makes sense for <em>your</em> finances, based on <em>your</em> goals and what’s happening in your local housing market.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things to consider:</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate your current circumstances: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would your mortgage payment be in relation to current rent? A good rent-versus-buy calculator can be found at <strong><a href=\"http://realtor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Realtor.com</a></strong></li>\n<li>Do you plan to be in the area for 5 years or more? The housing market will fluctuate. If you need to sell quickly, you may have to sell for less than desired, whereas a booming market can provide quick sales for a profit.</li>\n<li>Can you afford the additional costs? The cost of home ownership is more than just the mortgage payment. There are taxes, insurance and sometimes homeowner’s dues that need to be considered, not to mention upkeep, repairs, upgrades, and furniture!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assess Your Finances:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a good understanding of what your assets and liabilities are.</li>\n<li>Consider what you can afford. Being house poor and unable to save for emergencies, retirement, college or other financial goals can create a stressful situation.</li>\n<li>Speak with a lender about which programs you may qualify for; what a lender will approve you for and how much you can afford may not be the same thing.</li>\n<li>Take a look at your credit report. <strong><a href=\"http://Annualcreditreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a></strong> offers a free credit report from all three credit bureaus. Get one from each bureau and check it for accuracy.</li>\n<li>Meet with a financial advisor to strategize your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\"><strong>financial planning</strong></a> Is it better to make a higher down payment, pay down debt to get your debt to income ratios lower? Or is it better to leave the money invested so the lender includes this in your financial reserves?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Get Pre-approval:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your chosen lender will review your financial information and credit, then make an assessment about how much home you can buy, what down payment is required, and the best loan program. The lender then provides a preapproval letter.</li>\n<li>A second option is having an underwriter review your completed file, evaluating your income, credit, and financial assets, then providing a pre-approval letter.   Having an underwriter review your file may require application fees and other costs to be paid up front.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contact a real estate agent:</strong></p>\n<p>Start your search online to help narrow down location and potential neighborhoods. This can save time (and therefore money) by giving you a sense of where you want to live and what is available in your price range.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay attention above all to location: be sure you are within an acceptable commute to work, schools and other activities that you will be involved in on a regular basis.</li>\n<li>Consider resale value: do not buy the most expensive home in the neighborhood.</li>\n<li>Consider how you want to use your financial resources: fixer-uppers are the best bargains but take both cash and time to complete.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Buying a home is an exciting decision and can result in a solid investment that appreciates over time. Whether or not this is the right moment to purchase is something you should evaluate carefully with your financial advisor, based on your current financial plan and your long-term goals, not based on the news or economic “predictions.”</p>\n<p>While interest rates may have risen slightly they are still at historic lows, so don’t miss out the opportunities that a low-interest rate environment offers homeowners and prospective homeowners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You may have to postpone that fantasy of buying a private island in Thailand, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still be on your way to achieving your financial goals and dreams.</p>\n<p>Here’s one way to do it – take that money you&#8217;re sinking into lottery tickets and invest it instead.</p>\n<p>Why are so many people willing to waste hundreds of dollars on a lottery they won&#8217;t win instead of investing it in capital markets that have shown growth over time? Many reasons. For some people, the hardest part of saving and investing could be just getting started. For others, it&#8217;s not understanding the benefits of compound interest and that even small amounts add up over time. For others it may be fear of volatility and distrust or the markets from listening to too much CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg!</p>\n<p>While it’s true that markets have dipped significantly in January, market dips are a potential opportunity to buy low and earn higher returns over time. The bottom line is that, for most people, even those starting with modest amounts, keeping money in cash is generally <a href=\"http://cramersshirt.weebly.com/blog/cash-is-king-in-your-401k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not a winning proposition</a>.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p>Lets say you are contributing $250 each month ($3k/yr) to your 401k plan with a 100% company match and invest it in a diversified basket of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. At the same time, you save and invest $20 a week (the cost of 10 Powerball tickets a week) in a regular investment account. Assuming historical 4.8% annual returns*, here is how your money will grow over a 20-year period (in today’s dollars) vs. saving the same amount as cash:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2775 size-full\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1.png\" alt=\"Picture1\" width=\"853\" height=\"511\" /></a></p>\n<h6>*based on a diversified portfolio that assumes the following weights: 25% in the S&amp;P 500, 10% in the Russell 2000, 15% in the MSCI EAFE, 5% in the MSCI EME, 25% in the Barclays Aggregate, 5% in the Barclays 1-3m Treasury, 5% in the Barclays Global High Yield Index, 5% in the Bloomberg Commodity Index and 5% in the NA REIT Equity REIT Index. Balanced portfolio assumes annual rebalancing. All data represents total return for stated period. Past performance is not indicative of future returns. Data are as of 12/31/15. Annualized (Ann.) return and volatility (Vol.) represents period of 12/31/99 – 12/31/15.

But first speak with a financial advisor about your current situation and future goals and what the best steps are to start working towards financial freedom.</p>\n<p>And when the next Powerball comes around?

In December it was Wells Fargo doing the “ghosting.” By urging its brokers to get rid of clients with a minimum balance of less than 65,000, Wells Fargo Advisors sent a clear message to younger investors that, going forward, their money is “no good” at Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>In a company statement quoted by <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/author/janet-levaux\">Janet Levaux</a> in Think Advisor, Wells Fargo, which is the most valuable financial institution in the world according to the WSJ,* said that, in 2016, “bonuses will be awarded to FAs with 75% of their client households at $250,000.”</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo isn’t the only large institution effectively ignoring Millennials and other smaller and entry-level clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades.</p>\n<p>As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first time investors, it has also inspired a new breed of smaller independent RIAs, like Sherman Wealth Management (“SWM”), as well as the the new &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221; firms.</p>\n<p>Younger, breakaway firms like SWM aren’t looking for “efficiencies” or working for sales commissions on the products we recommend. Our focus is different. We strive to help investors build a strong foundation then grow <em>with</em> them, not by profiting off the trades, good or bad, we recommend for them.</p>\n<p>Where large brokerages currently see a “revenue problem,” we see a growth potential and are building long-term lasting relationships. By the time Wells Fargo and the other firms with traditional models get around to investing their time and attention in younger investors, it may just be too late. Those Millennial clients will be growing their wealth with firms that didn’t “ghost” them and, like Jack – spoiler alert! – may end up being “frozen out” of the largest wealth transfer in the history of the world as capital shifts from Boomers to Millennials.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Was it “retire and live on a boat in Hawaii?” “Quit my job and become a deejay?” “Book a ride to the Space Station?” Or even just “Stop worrying about how to pay for my kids’ college?”</p>\n<p>Your answer &#8211; however crazy or however normal &#8211;  is a window into what’s really important to you and a great way of evaluating your current financial strategy. Is upgrading your home a potential goal? Have you budgeted enough for your passions? Should you start saving more for more travel and adventure? Have you looked into 529 plans?</p>\n<p>As a Financial Advisor, I would advise that you not waste that $2 when it would be better spent collecting compound interest. I would ask you whether you’d already contributed to your 401K plan, your emergency fund, and your other long or short term savings goals. Then I would suggest that if you really wanted to play Powerball, that you re-allocate that $2 from another area –  skipping the caramel latte this morning, for instance, or biking to work tomorrow to save on gas – so that the $2 is amortized.</p>\n<p>But I would also tell you to keep dreaming, because those things you are dreaming about are a great way to evaluate whether your current savings and investment goals are tailor-made to help you achieve the life you really want, the life you’d lead if there was nothing standing in your way.</p>\n<p>So consider it: if you won $90 million dollars, what’s the first thing you’d do?

No matter how careful you’ve been all year, it’s tempting to splurge on some of the things that make us happiest: good times with friends and family, travel, entertaining, and generous gift-giving to friends, loved ones, and favorite charities.</p>\n<p>Here are 9 end of year tips to help make sure you’re still on target with budget and strategy and help keep important goals in mind if you’re tempted to go over budget during the holidays.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review your budget:</strong> See where you can scrimp a little so you have more to spend on holiday fun. Bring lunch to work, skip bottled water or sodas, or take public transportation, for instance and use the money for holiday treats, travel, or gifting. Seeing where you can cut spending may give you some ideas about how to live more frugally in 2016 so you can pay down debt faster or increase your savings significantly.</li>\n<li><strong>Max out your 401K:</strong> Before the end of the year, take full advantage of your company’s matching program. Those matching funds are the gift that keeps giving through the power of compound interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Use your Flexible Spending Account:</strong> If you have a flex account for healthcare, transportation, or dependent care, try to use your yearly allowance before the end of the year. Cash in on that new pair of glasses you’ve been wanting. If you didn’t use it all – or if you’d already spent it all by May – rethink what you should set aside next year.</li>\n<li><strong>Take a look at this year’s tax refund:</strong> Decide if it makes sense to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\">reduce how much is withheld</a> from each paycheck. By reducing your withholding you’ll have more money in 2016 for investments, savings, and next year’s holiday spending, instead of lending it, interest-free, to Uncle Sam.</li>\n<li><strong>Talk to your financial advisor:</strong> Whether having a conversation about converting from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA or what to declare next year on your taxes, the end of the year is the right time to make new financial decisions. Your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/top-10-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">financial advisor</a> can also help you determine if you have assets that are either above or below your target allocation. If you’re selling at a loss, you can take advantage of a tax write-off!</li>\n<li><strong>Review your insurance policies:</strong> Review any changes in your circumstance or property to make sure you have the right amount of coverage for all contingencies. At the same time, make sure you’re not over-paying for coverage you no longer need.</li>\n<li><strong>Give to your family:</strong> You can give up to $14,000 each to family members with no gift tax or reporting requirements, and the recipient doesn’t pay any tax either.</li>\n<li><strong>Give to charity:</strong> Before the end of the year, charitable donations are not only a great way to express your values, they are also a good way to increase your itemized deductions.</li>\n<li><strong>Save for the kids:</strong> Consider giving children or grandchildren an investment in their future and a first lesson in investing by contributing money to a 529 College Saving Plan! They can use the extra dollars tax-free for college tuition, room and board, and you get a state income tax deduction for your contribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it’s better to give than receive, don’t leave any free money or tax advantages on the table! Review your budget and see if you can add a line item for next year’s holidays so that December 2016 will be the happiest and most stress-free holiday season ever.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Read these tips before you start Googling timeshares in Cancun</strong></h4>\n<p>If you’ve got an end-of-year bonus or a well-deserved raise coming, it’s easy to think of it as “extra money” you can use to splurge on a trip to Mexico, a new phone, or a serious visit to the outlet stores. It’s particularly easy if you’ve been sticking to your budget and feel you deserve a little fun after behaving so responsibly all year!</p>\n<p>Before you blow that bonus on a phone upgrade or a cruise, though, consider these smart ways to really reward yourself with the extra infusion of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Upgrade Your Budget Instead of Your Phone</strong></p>\n<p>Still rocking a flip phone from the 90s? If so, yes, maybe you should invest in something smarter. But for most of us, it’s smarter to spread the extra cash across several budget items. Go ahead and add a little to your entertainment or entertaining budget, but consider allocating the rest of it to these smart ideas!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Make a Bigger Dent in your Debt</strong></p>\n<p>Are you feeling the weight of college loans, a mortgage, or, even worse, high interest credit card debt? You can lighten that load by using your bonus to make a larger payment than usual. It lowers your balance so it reduces some of those high interest charges moving forward. Increasing this budget category when you get that raise can also add up to a significant reduction of interest in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Invest to Watch it Grow</strong></p>\n<p>Setting aside money when you have large expenses to deal with <em>now</em> can be daunting. But the earlier you start investing the more time your money has to grow. If you haven’t already, create an investment account and put that bonus money to work for you, instead of leaving it in a checking account.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Kickstart Retiring</strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve kicked your tires and they need to be replaced, by all means, safety first! Use some of the rest of the money, though, to max out your company’s 401(k) contribution limits. If you qualify for an employer match, your bonus just got bigger!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Recalibrate Your Portfolios</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re already an investor, consider adding some of those extra funds to your investment portfolios. While you’re at it, take a look and see what’s working and what’s not.<strong> </strong>Your financial advisor can help you evaluate whether your allocations should be adjusted based on your risk tolerance and your long and short-term financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Start a College Savings Plan </strong></p>\n<p>It’s never too early to start saving for a child’s college education. By starting early, you can get a good head start and maximize compounded interest. Your financial advisor can help you choose a plan that works with your life, you goals your timeline, and, most importantly, your bonus!</p>\n<p><strong>7. Save for a Rainy Day</strong></p>\n<p>Those emergency funds may seem like low priority, until you suddenly need them. If you haven’t already, create an account with funds for unexepected expenses like job loss, emergency repairs, medical bills for you, your family, or your pets, and even weather emergencies (remember Hurricane Sandy?) A good rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses saved up just in case.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with treating yourself a little. You worked hard and you deserve it! Remember though, that by keeping the splurging and celebrating to a minimum, and letting that bonus or raise work for you, chances are you’ll have much more to celebrate when next year’s bonus comes around!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

But they weren’t alone. Many well-respected funds, including the mighty <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/valeant-holder-sequoia-fund-sees-98-9-million-in-outflows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequoia Fund</a>, and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman&#8217;s <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/25/valeant-bill-ackman-hedge-funds-losses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pershing Capital</a> also had extensive exposure to long time Wall Street darling Valeant and suffered losses not only of value – but of face as well.</p>\n<p>The dramatic losses came as quite a shock to many of the investors who own these &#8211; and other affected &#8211; funds, and <strong>who assumed that the funds were diversified</strong> – when in fact they weren’t. By going out on a limb and investing too much of their allocation in what has been one of Wall Street’s hottest stocks for years, many respected “hedge” funds experienced huge capital losses that it will take years to recover from.</p>\n<p>In fact, of the 1,000 hedge funds tracked by Symmetric.IO, approximately 12% had a position in Valeant. A startling 32% of Valeant’s shares were held by hedge funds.</p>\n<p><strong>When Diversification isn’t Diversification</strong></p>\n<p>Having 20% of your portfolio in one stock is a huge risk for anyone. You never know when the next Enron or Worldcom may be and, because of accusations of unorthodox practices, it may very well be Valeant.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Valeant could still turn out to be a home run and deliver big time. No one really knows, which is why diversification is so key.</p>\n<p>Many investors diversify with ETFs and mutual funds. But how many investors are absolutely certain that the mutual funds they are counting on to provide diversification, are, in fact, properly diversified themselves?</p>\n<p><strong>When that Hot Stock is Too Much of a Good Thing<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>When a “hot stock” or fund keeps climbing, it’s tempting to want to jump on the bandwagon, and the same is true for a hot sector. That’s no doubt why so many otherwise experienced fund managers over-exposed themselves to Valeant and to the health sector in general.</p>\n<p>But while a portfolio with correlated assets that tend to do well together, is also a portfolio with assets that can tend to do poorly together when the winds shift. As Ben Carlson put it in a recent <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/how-much-diversification-is-necessary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a>: “Diversification requires finding the right balance between eliminating unsystematic risk (risk that’s specific to single securities or industries) and di-worsification by adding too many overlapping funds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Put another way: it’s not enough to put your eggs in different baskets, the eggs themselves need to be diversified, some plain, some speckled, and the speckled ones should be speckled in different ways.</p>\n<p>A properly diversified mutual fund or ETF allow you to invest in a sector or a “hot stock” while mitigating risk. Which is no doubt what the investors who held Tiger, Pershing, and Sequoia thought they were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>The Moral of the Story</strong></p>\n<p>Due diligence. While you and your financial advisor are most likely diversifying your holdings, make sure that your holdings are also diversifying <u>their</u> holdings. Review your mutual funds frequently to make sure that their strategies, risk tolerance, and diversification standards align with yours and that they are not over-weighted chasing impressive returns from a couple of current wall street darlings.</p>\n<p>The jury is still out on Valeant and on the funds that held it. It may in fact recover, although it would have to recover quickly to make up for the loss of momentum for the funds and investors that held it.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’s an important lesson for individual investors. A truly diversified portfolio is made up of truly diversified assets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">****</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This analysis is provided for informational purposes only and is not to be considered investment advice.

The Matrix?</p>\n<p>And does <strong>Financial Advisor</strong> conjure up a swaggering DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street? Or maybe someone in a Brooks Brothers suit, describing products you barely understand?</p>\n<p>If you said yes to either, you’re not alone.</p>\n<p>One common fear about the new wave of robo advisors is that, once you take the “red pill” and dive in, you’re no longer in control. You’ve turned your money over to a mysterious series of algorithms with no human in sight to help you guide it.</p>\n<p>Many investors – particularly younger ones – are also put off by the idea of bespoke-suited advisors from traditional firms who are trying to up-sell them investments and insurance products with hefty fees and commissions. And even if they were to opt for the more conservative “blue pill,” traditional advisories are often not interested in speaking with them because they can’t make the hefty minimum investment.</p>\n<p>While there is some truth to both stereotypes, there are also<strong> big shifts</strong> going on in the financial industry that make this a great time to take advantage of both a new breed of independent financial advisor and the efficiencies that targeted robo-platforms can provide.</p>\n<p>Here are the differences – as well as drawbacks and benefits &#8211; in a nutshell:</p>\n<p><strong>Robo Advisors:</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive compared to full-service portfolio management</li>\n<li>Lower barrier to entry: lower initial investment requirements</li>\n<li>Democratic: all clients benefit equally from algorithmic decisions, not just the big investors</li>\n<li>Data-driven: driven by numbers, trends, and deep data – not emotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited scope: robo advisor only handle investment management, not comprehensive financial planning</li>\n<li>Generic: they categorize you using broad-stroke demographic – not individualized- goal and risk-tolerance profiling to build your portfolio</li>\n<li>Automatic: selling or “rebalancing” can be triggered by pre-set formulas at times that you might be wiser to stay put</li>\n<li>Limited opportunities: many robo-firms currently have a limited or “preferred” set of funds and options you can invest in</li>\n<li>Impersonal: no human interaction for questions regarding your individual investment portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Traditional Financial Advisory Firms</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone who picks up the phone when you call or will see you when you make an appointment.</li>\n<li>Flexible: can make real-time decisions about what’s right for you or when to buy or sell not rather than being locked into formulas.</li>\n<li>Multi-layers of expertise to call on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier to entry: many traditional advisories have high minimums and confusing requirements and may only offer enhanced services to “premium” clients</li>\n<li>Conflict of interest: many advisories have a “corporate agenda” to promote certain products, or they follow a [Suitability Standard] that doesn’t necessarily put the clients’ interests above their own</li>\n<li>Change resistant: larger organizations can be “too big for their own good,” and slow to incorporate new tech or new processes that add value for their clients or address clients’ individual needs.</li>\n<li>Limited customization: established firms frequently use old-school models of demographics, risk allocation, and target dates without factoring in what makes each client unique</li>\n<li>Impersonal: while customer service is available, traditional firms often don’t truly “meet you where you are” and customize services and portfolios for you unless you have a large portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Enter the New Breed</strong></p>\n<p>A growing number of independent financial advisors are disrupting the traditional model and starting to create a “third way,” <strong>hybrid advisories</strong> that strive to offer all the pros and – hopefully &#8211; none of the cons. They offer clients customized fee-only services – unhindered by corporate agendas &#8211; and with a lower minimum investment. At the same time they are able to incorporate the newest tech tools that not only make it easy for new clients to get started, but also offer fast, best-in-class investment management modeling to make faster decisions about managing investments.</p>\n<p>Or, as Josh Brown so eloquently put it in <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2015/10/18/the-ballad-of-the-breakaway-broker/\">a recent blog post</a>, “…innovation and creative spirit is fleeing from the Old World to the new one.”</p>\n<p>So why haven’t all advisors embraced the new technology to offer enhanced services to their clients? The three biggest reasons are inertia, inertia, and inertia. It’s not easy to change entrenched business models, culture, and processes. Remember how Netflix caught the video rental business napping?</p>\n<p><strong>Why Not Just Go with a Robo Advisor?</strong></p>\n<p>Robo advisors generally only offer investment management, not comprehensive, goal-oriented financial planning. While both investment advisors and robo advisors can recommend investment direction, strategy, and allocation, a good financial advisor can help you identify goals, customize budgets and cash flow planning, and help you with insurance, credit, and debt management, things a robo-platform can’t do.</p>\n<p>The most important thing about the integration of new tech with personal attention and a customized plan is that a user-friendly tech interface can allow clients to manage all the pieces of their financial plans, from cash flow to 401Ks, while allowing an experienced advisor to monitor it and give clients a call when that advisor sees an opportunity, a red flag, or wants to check in about goals and direction.</p>\n<p>These days, clients can see through the bespoke suits; what they’re looking for is bespoke service. By embracing selected and appropriate technology, this new breed of independent financial advisors are able to offer all the “pros,” while creating a new model of more transparent, conflict-free financial management that’s available to everyone who wants to set – an achieve – financial goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"e2fdb181-f9bc-5eb5-be71-0f0209cda97a","slug":"the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor","title":"The Most Important Question You’ll Ever Ask Your Financial Advisor","content":"<p>Does your financial advisor follow the <strong>Fiduciary Standard</strong> or the <strong>Suitability Standard</strong>?</p>\n<p>If you don’t know the answer without peeking – or calling your Lifeline – you’re not alone.

But having a financial advisor who is making recommendations primarily based on your age and risk tolerance – and who could be putting their own, or their company’s, financial interests ahead of your interests &#8212; could be disastrous for your financial future.</p>\n<p>Instead, the <strong>Fiduciary Standard</strong>, which is the standard for registered investment advisors under state and federal regulations, requires that <span style=\"color: #000066;\">a </span>financial advisor act <strong>solely</strong> in a client’s best interest when offering financial advice.</p>\n<p><strong>Registered Investment Advisors</strong> &#8211; like Sherman Wealth Management &#8211; must follow &#8211; and are held to &#8211; the <strong>Fiduciary Standard.</strong> That means that a RIA must put their client’s needs ahead of their own, provide fully-disclosed, conflict-free advice, be fully transparent about fees, and continue to monitor a client’s investments, as well as their changing financial situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s a potential scenario that illustrates the differences</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say your broker-dealer has three possible funds to recommend to you. The first is a “suitable” index fund, offered by her own company, which pays her a 6% commission on the sale and charges a 2% annual fee. The second is a similarly suitable index fund that would pay her a 3% commission on the sale and has a 1% annual fee. The third is an index fund that has no sales commission and an annual fee of .5%. Under the Suitability Standard, she can recommend the higher priced fund and still satisfy the standard. Under the Fiduciary Standard, she would be required to recommend the third fund.</p>\n<p>This is not to suggest that broker-dealers or others operating under the Suitability Standard don’t look out for their clients.  While many reps who follow the Suitability Standard give their clients excellent advice, they operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest.</p>\n<p>So go ahead and let the waiter talk you into that chocolate cake (even though you know you’ll feel better tomorrow if you have the strawberries.) But when it comes to your money, think carefully about whose advice you are taking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.finra.org/investors/suitability-what-investors-need-know\">http://www.finra.org/investors/suitability-what-investors-need-know</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://financialplanningcoalition.com/issues/fiduciary-standard-of-care/\">http://financialplanningcoalition.com/issues/fiduciary-standard-of-care/</a></p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"e88cd80a-3c50-5805-bac7-e7d9e6c193be","slug":"donald-trump-and-the-benefit-of-financial-foresight","title":"Donald Trump and the Benefit of Financial Foresight","content":"<p>Donald Trump’s current net worth – as he would be the first to tell you &#8211; is estimated to be between $2 and $4 billion, most of which he made through inheritance and real estate investments, along with other business dealings. <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/09/02/1-easy-way-donald-trump-could-have-been-even-richer-doing-nothing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An article in National Journal</a> recently took a look at what might have happened if he had invested in an S&amp;P 500 index fund back in 1982 when his inherited real estate fortune was estimated to be worth “only” $200 million.  According to National Journal’s calculations, if he’d invested carefully in index funds, Trump’s net worth would be a whopping $8 billion today.</p>\n<p>Does this mean Donald Trump is a bad investor? Not necessarily: the oldest lesson on Wall Street is that everything is easy in hindsight.</p>\n<p>While highly speculative, those numbers do highlight the ongoing debate over which is a better investment – real estate instruments or stocks. Both stocks have and the real estate market have had great runs in recent history and, depending on when you invested, you could make cases for both investments being the better choice.</p>\n<p>But the stock market and the real estate market both experience volatility, dips, and extended recovery times so, for the average investor, a portfolio composed of mainly real estate or other fixed assets (like art or collectibles, for instance) poses some risks that should be hedged with proper cash flow planning, a diversified portfolio, and proper tax planning.</p>\n<p><strong>Cash Flow Planning</strong></p>\n<p>A good financial plan takes into account how much cash you need access to, or may need access to in the future. Cash flow planning should be a key factor in deciding whether real estate investments are part your individualized financial strategy.</p>\n<p>As National Journal points out, Trump claims he is willing to spend upwards of $1 billion of his own money to fund his presidential campaign, yet his financial disclosure statements show that he may have less than $200 million in cash, stocks, and bonds. The rest of his fortune is tied up in real estate investments, which could be much harder to liquidate and use for his campaign.</p>\n<p>Most of us aren’t running for president but, if something like the 2007 housing collapse were to happen again, any investor who is predominantly invested in real estate could have problems liquidating those – diminished &#8211; assets for retirement, college funding, or other non-presidential goals.</p>\n<p>A solution: diversification.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you are investing in real estate or the stock market, diversification is always a prudent way to address your own risk tolerance and use proper foresight in creating a winning strategy.</p>\n<p>While with real estate funds, diversification can be achieved via many factors, including residential vs commercial investments, differing location focuses, and differing interest rates and financing mechanisms, it is still fundamentally one sector, subject to sentiment and swings.</p>\n<p>With the stock market, on the other hand, diversification allows you the opportunity to invest not only in different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and money market funds, but in a variety of sectors and industries as well. Over the past 60 years, historically, the stock market has averaged an <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp#sthash.TXk7awA7.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8% annual return</a>, so investors with strategically balanced and diversified portfolios, there is the opportunity for steady, while not spectacular gains, with the potential for less risk than investing only in the real estate market.</p>\n<p>An investor who is properly diversified through multiple asset classes – including real estate if it makes sense for their own customized strategy – is potentially better protected against the short term results of one asset class experiencing a crash or a prolonged dip.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is that options for investing in real estate in IRAs and other tax-deferred accounts are complicated and not every custodian will allow you to include real estate investments in a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/self-directed-real-estate-iras.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax-deferred account</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hindsight vs Foresight</strong></p>\n<p>While Donald Trump is an outlier because his high net worth shelters him from some of the issues with primarily being invested in real estate, it’s intriguing to consider “what if.”</p>\n<p>In the case of a more typical investor, a little foresight can go a long way in making sure you are on your way to achieving your own financial goals. A sound financial plan should be tailored to individual goals and cash flow needs, with a customized cash flow plan, and diversified across multiple asset classes for the potential for steady and compounded growth over time.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a Donald Trump with a large inheritance or a young professional just getting started, a solid plan and strategy puts the benefit of hindsight where it belongs: in a conversation over coffee or cocktails, and not as the basis for a winning investment strategy.</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"2895994a-1dcf-5a78-8a38-b3e52025d1a8","slug":"my-response-to-a-millennials-open-letter-to-cnbc","title":"My Response To a Millennial&#8217;s Open Letter To CNBC","content":"<p>After the markets took an incredibly volatile ride on August 24th, zerohedge.com published <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-24/one-millennials-letter-cnbc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this letter</a> to CNBC from a millennial named Ryan, who wrote:</p>\n<p><em>“I&#8217;ve dipped my toes in the stock market this past year but after today&#8217;s action, I have to say I&#8217;m done.

And that’s unfortunate for Ryan and his fellow GenY-ers.</p>\n<p>Ryan’s letter is worth a read &#8211; and he’s makes a couple of good points &#8211; but he’s also misses a very important point: none of this should really matter to a Millennial.</p>\n<p>Here’s why.</p>\n<p><em>“I&#8217;m sure countless little guys had their stocks absolutely steamrolled this morning only to see the big guys scoop up the shares on a discount.”  </em></p>\n<p>There is obviously a <strong>wide range of ways to experience the market:</strong> as a small investor, as a large investor, and as a robot.  Are other people going to do better than you sometimes?

But that shouldn’t matter to you, and shouldn’t keep you from investing in your own financial independence.</p>\n<p>The stock market is volatile and, sure, some investors may make impressive bets while others experience much too impressive losses (all investing involves risk, including the risk of the loss of principal.) But, historically, the S&amp;P 500 averaged a <span class=\"__postbox-detected-content __postbox-detected-date\"><span class=\"__postbox-detected-content __postbox-detected-date\">7-8%</span></span> return (after inflation)* each year and that’s value you’re missing out on if you’re not invested.</p>\n<p><em> “The only &#8220;people&#8221; who can react to those pricing distortions in real time are computers.

And this season, as in previous ones, fans will be wondering why some fantasy team managers just seem to have a knack for finding those sleepers and high upside players, while other managers routinely fail to understand and predict player value.</p>\n<p>Investors often wonder the same thing: why do some investors consistently get it right and prosper, while others are lucky if they even break even?</p>\n<p>Coincidence? Maybe, but there are several important things successful fantasy football managers have in common with successful real-life investors.</p>\n<p>Here are three important mindsets that can help you go the whole 9 yards, whether it’s on the virtual gridiron or with your own financial plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Research the Players</strong></p>\n<p>A good fantasy football manager knows that you need to study all the different variables &#8211; including roster positions, draft picks, and expected performance – to build a winning team. Understanding the available options is critical to determining things like how many players you need at each position and which players you think will be the best.</p>\n<p>This same principal applies to investing. A smart investor or financial advisor starts by understanding all the different variables, such as capital, types of investments, and asset classes. Understanding the pros and cons of various investment strategies is critical in determining how to choose a strategy that is the appropriate option for your own goals and needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Never count on a couple of stars to carry the team</strong></p>\n<p>When drafting your fantasy team, you always want to diversify your risk. You might not want to draft multiple offense players from the Green Bay Packers, for instance, even if that team is loaded with talent, because, if Aaron Rodgers and company have a bad week, your fantasy team will be struggling too. Smart fantasy managers build a stable foundation and don’t just count on rising stars.</p>\n<p>When building your investment portfolio, risk diversification is critical as well. Wall Street is littered with stories of investors who put all their eggs in one “sure” basket, only to learn the lesson of diversification the hard way. Even if you’re extremely confident that a certain sector is a good bet, it’s usually better to diversify and limit your amount of exposure to individual sectors. That way, even if the sector doesn’t do as well as you had anticipated, your investments are distributed across other asset classes, and your risk should be better managed.</p>\n<p><strong>When the going gets tough, the tough stay disciplined</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who has played fantasy football knows the danger of making a snap waiver wire decision you’ll regret later. On one hand, you don’t want to panic and drop your star player after a rough few weeks, only to see him rebound to a MVP-caliber season (and on someone else’s team!) On the other hand, just because an unproven player has a great week doesn’t mean he’s more valuable than the player you’d have to drop in order to acquire him.</p>\n<p>When the market hits a volatile patch, it takes a disciplined investor to trust their plan and avoid making snap decisions about buying and selling. A look at the history of the stock market makes it abundantly clear that investors who take a long term view do better than those who shift their investment strategies with every changing wind. This doesn’t mean that any plan should be viewed as foolproof; a good investor or financial advisor knows the value of reassessing and recalibrating appropriately and strategically. What it does mean is that, when the going gets tough, a prudent investor takes the long view, stays disciplined, and sticks to a strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s a long season</strong></p>\n<p>The only NFL team in history to have an undefeated season is the Miami Dolphins who finished 17-0 in the shorter 1972 season. No NFL team has gone 19-0 to date so it’s highly unlikely that any fantasy team will achieve perfection either. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have a great season and get smarter and smarter about putting together a winning team.</p>\n<p>With investing too, there will always be ups and downs, touchdowns and penalties, fumbles and conversions, and a few Hail Mary’s. But with a solid game plan and clearly defined goal, you’ll be on your way to a putting together a strategy designed to stand the test of time and put you squarely where you want to be: heading toward your own end zone with your eye on the ball and your own goals in sight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1304073-091715</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"cd6a61cc-b72e-551d-9e88-0024e944a04c","slug":"straight-talk-about-volatility-and-compound-interest-the-snowball-effect","title":"Straight Talk about Volatility and Compound Interest &#8211; the Snowball Effect","content":"<p>Compound interest is, simply put, the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment has already earned.</p>\n<p>Why is it important? Because your two potential advantages when it comes to maximizing potential earnings over time are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The power of compound interest</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Investing regularly through market highs <u>and</u> lows</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s break this dynamic duo down:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>The Power of Compounding</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Compound interest</strong> is often compared to a snowball. If a 2-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny circumference. As it keeps rolling, its surface grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution.</p>\n<p>If you invest $1000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you’ll have $2158.93, in 20 years that will be $4660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. All it takes is patience to turn $1000 &#8211; the price of one ski weekend &#8211; into $21,724.52.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to start saving early.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1861\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1024x786.jpg\" alt=\"chart25\" width=\"976\" height=\"749\" /></a></p>\n<h5><em>The above chart is hypothetical and assumes an 8% rate of return compounded annually. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any specific investment.   Investment return and principal values will fluctuate so that your investment when redeemed may be worth more or less than its original cost. Rates of return do not include fees and charges, which are inherent to other investment products. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</em></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Volatility &#8211; Market Highs and Lows</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what happens if the market dips and your investment loses value?</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong> &#8211; when market value fluctuates up and down – can be an opportunity for disciplined savers who contribute regularly to their investments, regardless of share price. When prices are low, you’re able to buy more shares. When prices are high you’re able to buy fewer shares for the same amount but those shares earn more interest, which is called Dollar Cost Averaging (<em>Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.</em>)</p>\n<p>Imagine that snowball again, rolling down a hill, acquiring more and more snow as it goes. What happens when it hits a bare patch with no snow? Often it picks up rocks and pebbles, which add even more surface volume. So, when it hits the snow again, it picks up even more because it’s larger.</p>\n<p>That’s how compound interest, coupled with regular investments, may work too: the “rough patches” produce more volume, which then allows you to acquire more compounded interest. So if you buy more shares during a dip, when the market recovers you could hypothetically not only earn compound interest on more shares, you earn more interest. So long as the price of your particular investment recovers, of course.</p>\n<p>As Josh Brown points out in his recent blog post about Warren Buffett and David Tepper, both these legendary investors have gotten to where they are today because they’ve successfully ridden out volatility. In 1998 Warren Buffets own Berkshire Hathaway’s “A” shares had dropped in price from approximately $80,000 to $59,000 but Buffet didn’t sell. Those shares just hit a high of $229,000 this year.</p>\n<p>If you see volatility &#8211; like what we experienced in August &#8211; as a tool and keep contributing regularly to your investments, you’ll potentially maximize the effect of compounded interest and watch your investments snowball over time!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1174145-041515</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>******</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additional Reading:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Lcau6UsmWN\"><p><a href=\"https://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/13/how-two-of-historys-greatest-investors-deal-with-losses/\">How two of history&#8217;s greatest investors deal with losses</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;How two of history&#8217;s greatest investors deal with losses&#8221; &#8212; The Reformed Broker\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/13/how-two-of-historys-greatest-investors-deal-with-losses/embed/#?secret=Lcau6UsmWN\" data-secret=\"Lcau6UsmWN\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>http://awealthofcommonsense.com/did-investors-just-experience-the-best-risk-adjusted-returns-ever/</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator\">http://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator</a></p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"3cac17f5-89cb-57ae-851b-395d890a1818","slug":"millennials-time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-stock-market","title":"Millennials – Time to Wake Up and Smell the Stock Market","content":"<p>On Monday, as things were heating up a bit, Cullen Roche <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cullenroche/status/635820302937796608\">tweeted</a> “The stock market is the only market where things go on sale and all the customers run out of the store&#8230;”</p>\n<p>The problem is, many Millennials weren’t even <u>in</u> the store.</p>\n<p>Only 26 percent of people under age 30 own stocks, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/more-millennials-say-no-to-stocks-and-advisors-adapt.html\">CNBC story </a>that same day. That means that, while not panicking, most Millennials may have been missing one of the biggest potential opportunities of the past 10 years.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Aren’t Millennials Investing?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are many theories –from Millennials being shell-shocked by experiencing their families’ anxiety in 2008, to YOLO, the feeling that it’s better to spend and enjoy the money now because who knows what the future may bring. The problem is that the future is likely to bring a whole lot fewer opportunities if you haven’t planned properly!</p>\n<h3><strong>Are You Even Beating Inflation? </strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s say hypothetically that the stock market may rebound by 5%&#8230; Simple, common sense math shows that keeping your money in the bank at .05% interest means it would take you 100 years to make the same amount of money that investing it now could. And the cash you are saving under the mattress or in one of your vintage vinyl sleeves? That money is just losing value every second you leave it there, as the cost of blankets and concert tickets continues to climb with inflation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Risk, Volatility, and Paper Losses</strong></h3>\n<p>It’s important to know the difference between risk and volatility and many people get it wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong> – stock prices moving up and down – is a normal part of the stock market <u>and</u> an opportunity for a disciplined saver to buy when the market is both up and down. When you have a solid plan in place you can capitalize on market price dislocations, like what happened this week. <strong>Risk</strong> is how likely you are to lose it all and it’s important to remember – while everyone has their own risk tolerance – price corrections and market volatility does not necessarily mean you are going to lose it all. As the chart below borrowed from The Irrelevant Investor’s <a href=\"https://theirrelevantinvestor.wordpress.com/2015/08/24/should-investors-stay-the-course/#more-1843\">excellent post</a> on staying the course shows, the stock market has historically climbed in spite of dips. And <strong>paper losses</strong> are just that: it’s not real loss if you don’t sell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1819\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm.png\" alt=\"stock market drops\" width=\"640\" height=\"432\" /></a></p>\n<p>As this chart by Deutsche Bank’s <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.in/There-are-2-big-problems-with-blaming-China-for-the-stock-market-sell-off/articleshow/48670991.cms\">Torsten Slok</a> shows, in spite of other times of great volatility, markets have always recovered. It’s just a question of timing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CNQVAncWwAAtuB7-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1820\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CNQVAncWwAAtuB7-1.png\" alt=\"torsten\" width=\"599\" height=\"455\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Millennials: This is Your Wake-up Call</strong></h3>\n<p>When I speak to fellow Millennials, they say that the real reasons they don’t invest are that 1) it’s daunting to get started and 2) they don’t know where to get help. The big companies aren’t interested in smaller investors with less than <a href=\"http://www.wealthprofessional.ca/news/mega-firm-cuts-small-accounts-194854.aspx\">250-500K</a> and the robo solutions don’t understand what makes each smaller investor’s situation unique. There’s a whole new breed of financial advisors, however, who combine personalized service with targeted tech solutions for smaller investors. So no excuses &#8211; there are financial pros ready help you create an investment strategy that makes sense for your personal goals and financial situation. And volatility doesn’t disrupt what we do!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’ve got a solid financial plan, investing in the stock market does not affect your ability to pay your rent, take care of yourself or your family, or add to that rainy day emergency fund. The money you’re saving and investing is money that you’ve determined <em>you don’t need now</em>, it’s money you have set aside for the long haul.

From scouring the finance blogs and Twitter for the latest “surefire” ways to beat the market, to diagnosing our aches on WebMD, to grilling along with Bobby Flay on YouTube, it can seem like we have almost instant access to the same information as the pros.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to personal finances, why is it necessary to have a financial advisor when financial news is so readily available, Twitter is flooded with “hot tips,” robo advisors are ready to automate the whole process for you, and comparison shopping is so easy? Why can’t you just use this treasure trove of information to make your own financial decisions? Or subscribe to an algorithm-based service that will make the best lightning-quick decisions for you?</p>\n<p>A couple of reasons&#8230;</p>\n<p>If you’re good and you dedicate a lot of time online, you can definitely pick up some great information and strategies that the experts are sharing (follow me on Twitter by clicking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shermanwealth\">here</a>!) The tricky part is making sure that the information and the strategies are actually appropriate for you and appropriate right now. We all know that, if we’re not careful, the instantaneous nature of the internet, social media, and impersonal algorithms can lead to impulsive decisions that may not support our own long-term goals and personal risk profile. Quick reactions to new stock market “darlings” or to sudden market volatility can lead to choices that are not the best for your long &#8211; or even near – term financial health and growth. In fact, there is a whole science called Behavioral Finance that addresses how personal biases can lead investors to make decisions that actually work against the goals they set for themselves.</p>\n<p>A good financial professional is able to sift through the vast amount of information available to you and determine what is significant to your strategy and what may just be a distraction. A financial advisor who understands Behavioral Finance can help you see where your assumptions, habits, and biases about money and investing may be leading you to get in your own way.</p>\n<p>The new algorithm-based platforms are increasingly interesting and have a lot of merit, but the level of personalization is not yet very deep. That means that portfolios are based on broad criteria that may have nothing to do with your current situation, lifestyle, and goals. Again, this is where a trained professional will be able to view your unique individual needs and create a tailored strategy that is geared to you and not just everyone who matches your age and salary level. As more and more fiduciary financial advisors are starting to use smart algorithms as part of their offerings where appropriate, the key is “where appropriate” and “in the clients’ best interest,” the very definition of a fiduciary.</p>\n<p>Think about it: would you rather grill along with Bobby Flay on your iPad or would you rather have regular meetings with Bobby, where he looks at the size and model of your Weber, the size of your shrimp, and the recipes you’re trying to learn, and works with you to make sure you become the master of your own grill? (and shrimp!)</p>\n<p>The same goes for your financial future. While do-it-yourself is getting easier and easier, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s getting better and better. Look for a fiduciary financial advisor who also has access to the latest information online and is familiar with the latest algorithmic innovations, but who uses that information to get to know clients individually, and tailors a long-term growth strategy for them that will put them on the road to achieving the goals they have set for themselves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p>With over a decade’s worth of experience in financial services, Brad Sherman is committed to helping his clients pursue their financial goals.

Rule #1: Don’t Panic","content":"<p>Whenever there’s a crisis, it’s good to have an emergency plan, and when there’s a financial crisis, it’s good to have a financial emergency plan. When you’ve thought through a plan, it’s less likely that panic &#8211; or other “behavioral mistakes” &#8211; will lead you to react in ways you may be regretting for a long time.</p>\n<p>While most investors say they’ll continue to hold on to their investments when there’s a sharp downturn (and many even say that they’ll add money when their investments go down), data tells a far different story. In December 2008, right as the market was near its lowest point, investors pulled out a whopping $10.6 billion from equity mutual funds alone.</p>\n<p>Panicking during market bottoms is a form of “behavioral bias” that can have a devastating effect on financial health. While the S&amp;P 500 has averaged around 10% a year, costly behavioral mistakes cause many individual investors to significantly <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/11621555/1/average-investor-20-year-return-astoundingly-awful.html\">miss those gains.</a> That’s because, despite good advice, people still tend to put money in the stock market as it rises and pull money out as the market falls. The result: many investors buy <a href=\"http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/are-we-buying-high-all-over-again/?scp=1&amp;sq=buy%20low%20stocks&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=1#sthash.kSv3JRiw.dpuf\">at market tops</a> and sell at market bottoms.</p>\n<p>While none of us are immune to behavioral biases, there are several things we can do to help avoid costly mistakes.</p>\n<h3><strong> 1.  Learn From the Past</strong></h3>\n<p>The first step is to understand that market declines are a normal part of investing and resist the urge to panic!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1472\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1472\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://theirrelevantinvestor.tumblr.com/post/113520921728/where-do-stocks-go-from-here-after-six-years-of\"><img class=\"wp-image-1472 size-full\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540.jpg\" alt=\"tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540\" width=\"540\" height=\"288\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CRSP 1-10 Index</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While the S&amp;P has historically returned almost 10% annually since the 1960s, those returns are not consistent. One year the market could be up 20% and the next it could decline 12%! To make the ride even bumpier: the market also has streaks where returns decline for several consecutive years. That’s when investors often begin to panic and pull their money out. Unfortunately, that’s usually the worst time to do so, and when investors often should be increasing their investments instead.</p>\n<p>Although the market can move up and down in the course of a year, or several years, it has historically trended upwards over longer periods of time (10 or 20 years.) So if your investment horizon is longer than just a few years, remember that it’s likely the market will <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">recover its losses</a> &#8211; and then some &#8211; over time.</p>\n<p>Understanding that the U.S. stock market bounces back after its declines is a helpful first step in creating “un-biased” financial habits!</p>\n<h3>2.  <strong>Understand that Accepting Lower Returns May be Okay </strong></h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, younger investors have more years ahead of them to invest. That means they are often able to put a higher percentage of their money in stocks and a very low, or even zero, percentage in bonds. How much you allocate to stocks will depend on factors such as your own investment objectives and your ability to tolerate risk.</p>\n<p>If you know that you’re prone to panicking during market declines, however, you may want to keep your portfolio in more conservative investments than your age and investment horizon would normally indicate.</p>\n<p>It’s much better to be a bit more conservative and hold on to your investments during market downturns, than to buy riskier assets and sell during market crashes!</p>\n<h3><strong> 3.  Speak with a Professional</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’re like most Americans, chances are you spend more time researching your next car than researching your investments!</p>\n<p>Investing can be a difficult &#8211; and sometimes dry &#8211; subject. Learning about the history of the stock market, your own risk tolerance, and behavioral biases that can trip you up is challenging for most people and probably something you don’t want to spend a lot of time on.</p>\n<p>That’s where a trusted financial planner can help.</p>\n<p>A good financial planner can help guide you along the path in planning for your own financial goals; explain difficult concepts; help you discover your own risk tolerance; recommend appropriate investments based on those risk tolerances; and help you avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people’s portfolios.</p>\n<p>A good financial planner also understands the history of the market and knows that, while bull markets don’t last forever, declines are generally temporary as well. Knowing that, and having a plan tailored to your specific financial goals will help you to avoid panicking when markets go south, and avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people’s portfolios.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brad Sherman is a financial advisor based in Gaithersburg Maryland who is experienced in understanding both the history of the market, as well as how behavioral biases affect investor returns.

These three simple steps will give your increased focus and will help you move closer to that goal.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve incorporated them in your daily routine, identify a second goal and follow the same plan. The key to success is taking it one step at a time!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy Use Downtime Wisely </strong></h3>\n<p>At the end of your workday, do you like to relax with Netflix, video games, or YouTube? According to Corley’s data, <strong>66%</strong> of the wealthy said that they watch less than an hour of television a day, <strong>63%</strong> spend less than an hour a day on the Internet unless it is job-related, an impressive <strong>79%</strong> say they read career and educational material each day, and an equally impressive <strong>63%</strong> said &#8220;I listen to audio books during the commute to work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While we all like to relax and recharge with entertaining media, that time can never be recovered for things that help you become a stronger, more successful individual like reading, networking, exercising, or volunteering for a cause you believe in.</p>\n<p>Time is the great equalizer: we all have 24 hours a day. What you choose to do with that time can either help you to reach your financial and life goals, or distract you from it, so choose wisely!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy Invest in Their Future </strong></h3>\n<p>Corley’s research also showed that <a href=\"http://www.success.com/article/16-rich-habits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the wealthy live within their means</a>, pay themselves first, and don’t overspend.</p>\n<p>Building wealth is not accomplished by upgrading to each new electronic gadget, leasing the newest model car, and living in an extravagant home. The wealthy, according to Corley, spend less than they earn, own and maintain their cars for many years, and save a significant portion of their income. While saving money and living modestly is not as sexy as a flashy smartphone, it will go a lot further toward providing a comfortable future.</p>\n<p>Living within your means also includes not carrying credit card balances or heavy debt. When you are carrying debt, what you earn today is paying for yesterday’s expenses. Living within your means while saving and investing a portion of your income lets you invest in tomorrow, rather than yesterday, while learning to be satisfied with what you have today.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy are Willing to Take Risks </strong></h3>\n<p>Another fascinating finding of Corley’s research is that<strong> 63%</strong> of the wealthy people he interviewed said they that they had <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ways-rich-people-think-differently-2014-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taken risks</a> in search of wealth, while only 6% of the struggling Americans he interviewed said that they had taken risks.</p>\n<p>For many, fear of failure is a great de-motivator and can be paralyzing. When you do not fully understand something, whether it’s a challenge, a potential project, an investment, or even a social problem, it can be easier to do nothing than to act. But without risk, there is often no reward.</p>\n<p>What Corley discovered is that, instead, rather than fearing failure, the wealthy consider failure to be part of the process and – most importantly &#8211; an opportunity to learn.</p>\n<p>How can you face risk without fear so that you can seize potential opportunities? Educating yourself is the key step. Researching the investment, the project, or the choice, and learning about the options and risks, help keep fear and anxiety about the unknown from clouding your decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Even with the best preparation though, choices don’t turn out as envisioned. When that happens, take a page from the wealthy: learning from those failures and experiences will lead to more opportunities and better choices down the road!</p>\n<h3><strong>Are Your Own Habits Setting You Up for Success?</strong></h3>\n<p>While following each of these habits may not make you rich, they will certainly help you get into a success mind-set. <strong>68%</strong> of the Americans on Forbes billionaire list consider themselves to be “<a href=\"http://www.business-management-degree.net/features/wealthiest-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-made billionaires</a>,” which means that they worked hard to reach their own professional and financial goals. The true route to financial success is through discipline and steady habits that grow your net worth over time.</p>\n<p>Do you already share these four habits of the wealthy? If so, congratulations on your focus and your commitment to success. If not, try adopting one &#8211; or all four &#8211; of these important habits and see if it doesn’t get you closer to achieving your own goals!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With over a decade’s worth of experience in financial services, Brad Sherman is committed to helping his clients pursue their financial goals.

Here Are 4 Simple Steps To Get You Started","content":"<p>Close your eyes for a moment and envision where you’d like to be in 30 or 40 years… Are you sailing to Tahiti? Writing that book? Running your vineyard? Building a new company?</p>\n<p>If you had trouble envisioning where you’d like to be, you’re not alone. But unless you can visualize it, unless you’ve got your destination planned, it can be hard to get there. That’s why it’s so important to start thinking about what your goals currently are &#8211; whether it’s for yourself, your career, your startup, your art, and/or your family &#8211; and take the first – or the next – steps to invest in your future.</p>\n<p>What does investing mean? Very simply, it means putting your money somewhere you expect it to grow. It can be traditional stocks, bonds and mutual funds, or real estate, collectibles, annuities, and other things that are expected to gain value over time.</p>\n<p>When you’re just starting out, thinking about &#8211; and setting aside money for &#8211; your future can feel like a challenge; when you&#8217;ve just set up your first lemonade stand and barely breaking even, it’s hard to think about re-investing part of your profits in lemon groves that will someday produce income for you.</p>\n<p>The trick is to overcome inertia, get started, and make a commitment, even if it’s just a tiny first step.</p>\n<h3><strong>Inertia is not your friend</strong></h3>\n<p>Inertia is one of the biggest reasons people waste opportunities to started investing when they’re young.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Objects at rest tend to stay at rest:</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not investing yet, or if your money is sitting in a non-income producing bank account it can be hard to get started or get moving.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Objects in motion tend to stay in motion:</em></strong></p>\n<p>If your money is constantly in motion, if you’re spending everything you make, or if your money is following the crowd to the next big glamour stock, it can be hard to slow down and take stock with a Financial Planner to build a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>A study by Hewitt Associates found, for instance, that only 31% of employees in their 20s invest in their company’s 401K plan¹. That means almost 70% of young employees who could be investing in a matching 401k plan haven’t started taking advantage of what is essentially free money. Whether inertia is keeping them from getting started, or inertia is keeping their money in motion so that there’s none left over to invest, they are not only leaving free money on the table, they’re not letting that money grow through compounding.</p>\n<p>According to an article in US News and World Report, if you start investing just $100 a month in your 20s, increase contributions as your income increases, and make good financial decisions along the way, you are on your way to potentially retiring with over 1 million dollars.²</p>\n<h3><strong>How Do You Get Started?</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are four simple steps to get you past inertia and get you started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find your motivation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are all passionate about certain things. The more you care, the more focused you are about achieving your goals. Make a list of the things that are important to you and the things you want to achieve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find extra money</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are only two ways to “find” money &#8211; spending less or making more. While it may seem daunting – inertia again! – you’d be surprised by how easy it is to discover places you can cut back a little or spend a little less. And, while you have a lot more control over your spending than your earnings, you can also look for ways to find extra sources of income, work more hours, or even get a better paying job.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Move financial goals up</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you plan to save “whatever you have left” or “whatever you’ve saved” at the end of each month, don’t be surprised by how little that actually is. We all have a tendency to spend what we have, and spend more as our income goes up. You can avoid that pitfall by paying yourself first. When you prioritize saving in your budget and take that money “out of circulation,” your spending will fall in line.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get advice from an adviser you trust</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The world of finance and investing can be complicated and confusing. Don’t let fear of the unknown keep you from getting started. You don’t need a large amount of savings to meet with an adviser who can answer a lot of your questions. Getting a roadmap from someone who knows the territory will help you get started and may allow for a smoother journey.</p>\n<p>Investing in your future is an investment in yourself. If you take these four simple steps, even with limited assets, you’ll be laying the foundation for a lifetime of investing in your own plans and goals, and your own vision of financial freedom.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>All investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Putting money into the market when you’re young &#8211; even small amounts &#8211; gives your investments time to grow and compound over time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, too many millennials haven’t gotten started yet. A recent survey by Bankrate found that only 26% of Americans under 30 were invested in the stock market, compared to 58% between the ages of 58 and 64. (1)</p>\n<p>While the stock market has historically seen positive returns over the long run, it’s not hard to understand why many millennials are wary of it. Millennials under 30 have seen two major market crashes: the tech bubble of the late 1990’s as well as the 2008 economic crisis. Many saw how family members and friends lost years worth of savings and were often financially devastated by what happened.</p>\n<p>The result: a deep distrust of Wall Street and a desire to avoid the market altogether.</p>\n<p>While it is understandable that millennials are wary about putting their earnings into the market, it’s also unfortunate.</p>\n<p>In spite of the two crises of 1990 and 2008, if you had invested in the S&amp;P 500 at the beginning of 1985, and kept that money in until the end of 2014, you would have earned over 25 times what you had initially invested. (2) (3)</p>\n<p>Even saving just a small amount each week or month would have made a tremendous difference in your retirement savings.</p>\n<h4><strong><em>The Second Mistake</em></strong></h4>\n<p>While many millennials make the mistake of investing too little in the market, others make another critical mistake. While they may be making regular contributions, they may not be invested in a wide enough variety of securities.</p>\n<p>The youngest generations have grown up with access to the internet, social media, online financial media, and the tools to invest in any publicly traded security that they choose and they feel empowered to make investment decisions on their own, without consulting a professional. They’re also able to trade information with friends and make changes to their portfolio in a matter of seconds using their smartphone or computer.</p>\n<p>Because of this, millennials are often invested in individual hot stocks, companies they believe in, or companies that sell products they use and like. This can (and will) work for some investors sometimes as a result of sheer luck and the law of large numbers, but it is not a consistent – or wise &#8211; strategy to rely on.</p>\n<h4><strong><em>Buying What’s in the News</em></strong></h4>\n<p>In 2007 researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Davis published a paper where they showed that individual investors have a tendency to buy stocks that had recently been in the news, or that had share prices that had recently gone up (4). By buying these “hot” stocks, new investors were forced to bid up the price to a higher level than they were before the news story came out. The study showed that, because these investors were buying at an artificially higher price, their portfolios ended up performing poorly as a result of having bought these ‘hot stocks’.</p>\n<p>Additionally many millennials choose to engage in “socially responsible” investing, avoiding stocks in companies that sell products they don’t believe in, or that engage in business practices they feel are undesirable, and putting their money in companies that they believe in and feel good about.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this too can have a negative impact on their returns over the long run. By focusing so narrowly, their portfolios are missing a major piece of the market, which limits their diversification. Additionally social responsible investments can have higher fees than their non-SRI counterparts, because they have the added cost of screening out stocks based on certain criteria.</p>\n<p>Along with the added costs, and the decrease in diversification that result in focusing only on SRIs, researchers from Princeton and New York University published a paper in 2009 that showed that ‘sin stocks’ have historically outperformed their non-sin counterparts. (5)</p>\n<p>Whether you are choosing to invest your money in a single stock, or several stocks, or you choose to invest in a SRI investment, you are limiting your investment choices, which in turn limits your level of diversification and possibly your returns over the long run.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: if you avoid these two critical mistakes by starting to save – and invest &#8211; early, and by making sure your portfolio is diversified, you’ll be setting yourself up to watch your money grow over time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Broad-based investment vehicles with low fees and high levels of diversification, if appropriate to their specific circumstances, is one strategy to help clients toward their goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102602094\">http://www.cnbc.com/id/102602094</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm</a></li>\n<li>The S&amp;P 500 index is representative of domestic markets and includes the average performance of 500 widely held common stocks.

Along with the love and excitement you feel with a new baby boy or girl, comes the pressure of new responsibilities and additional financial obligations.</p>\n<p>Babies change your life in many ways, including requiring large amounts of time and money. While you may already be thinking about childcare costs and options, or about paying the medical bills that accompanied your new child, there are several other – important &#8211; financial considerations you should be thinking about even before the new baby arrives.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate Financial Priorities</strong>. It’s important to consider both short-term and long-term expenses that come with the addition of a new family member. It is a natural impulse, for instance, to want to put your child first and redirect retirement savings into college savings. But remember, you can borrow for college but you cannot borrow your way through retirement. It’s also important to balance long-term goals, like retirement and college expenses, with current financial needs, to help you allocate resources in an appropriate way.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Insurance Needs and Your Will</strong>. With the expansion of your family, insurance needs can change significantly. Having enough insurance is important in feeling confident about your family’s financial future. Adding your child to your health insurance policy can usually be done with a phone call. Making sure you have enough life insurance for both parents can help ensure you have the funds to raise your child if the unthinkable happens. Short-term disability insurance provides benefits if you have an accident that takes you out of work temporarily. Long-term disability insurance is critical in case a major accident has a permanent impact on your ability to work and earn. While some companies offer disability insurance, it can also be purchased independently.</p>\n<p>Updating your will or creating a trust can provide care instructions for your child and allocate resources for their upbringing. Without a will or trust, if you and your spouse die, the state will decide who will raise your children. A will establishes your wishes for who will care for your child. A trust can direct funds specifically earmarked for raising your children and can be an effective way to cover financial expenses and provide for college expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Start Planning For College Early</strong>. The sooner you start the better. While it is impossible to know exactly how much you’ll need to save &#8211; given that you don’t know what kind of college your child will choose – consider that in 2013-2014 the cost of a moderate in-state public university was $22,826 per academic year and the cost of a “moderate” private university averaged <strong>$44,750</strong>, according to a College Board survey. ¹</p>\n<p>For new parents this means that college could cost over <strong>$100,000</strong> for a public college and more than double that number for private school. Instead of trying to fund the entire cost of their education, determine how much you want to contribute. Having children be responsible for a part of their education is often a good lesson in work ethic, even if you can afford to pay for everything, and a critical life lesson if you can’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep Spending and Debt under Control</strong>. When you have an adorable child it’s very easy to overspend. You want them to have the best of everything. Setting a budget and sticking with that can help you keep your spending in line with your established budget. This can also help you maintain the discipline needed to continue contributions to long-term financial goals like retirement and their college education. And remember, the best gift you can give your children – your time and attention – is free.</p>\n<p>Another important consideration is debt. When you carry debt, you are paying today for yesterday’s bills. Investing potentially allows you to pay today for tomorrow’s bills. By keeping yesterday’s bills settled and debt to a minimum, you lay the foundations for having enough to enjoy today with your children and plan for tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Teach Children About Finances At An Early Age</strong>. Finances are a part of our daily lives. When you involve children early on they gain an appreciation for what things cost and how to choose what we want and what we can live without. As soon as your child old enough, start helping save their pennies for something they really want, and teach them that work is part of the process of earning money. These skills, if taught early, can lead to a lifetime of responsible money management.</p>\n<p>Parenting is an amazing adventure that changes the way you see yourself and the world. Keeping an eye on finances can provide you with the confidence you need to not only enjoy your growing family but help lay the foundations for a stronger future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>¹ <a href=\"http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064\">http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064</a></p>\n<p>LFS-1219374-060815</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"8f642361-0713-5baf-b3bc-0c9eced196ee","slug":"four-things-entrepreneurs-can-do-now-to-save-for-retirement","title":"Four Things Entrepreneurs Can do Now to Save for Retirement","content":"<p>While retirement may seem a long way off when you’re young and just starting to build a business – or older and rebooting &#8211; it’s important to have a retirement savings plan and stick to it to create the future you want.</p>\n<p>Retirement planning can be difficult for anyone, but entrepreneurs and small business owners can face unique challenges. According to a 2013 American Express survey, <strong>60 percent</strong> of small business owners said they weren’t saving enough for retirement, and over <strong>73 percent</strong> said they were worried about not being able to afford the lifestyle they want in retirement.</p>\n<p>While many employees can choose to make automatic deductions from their paycheck towards a 401k, for instance, entrepreneurs have to make a conscious decision to sock away money for retirement, as well as find plans that work for them.</p>\n<p>Fortunately there are several things that you can begin doing now to contributing to your long-term financial future. As always, please review these and other options with your financial planner to see what strategy may be most suitable for your individual situation.</p>\n<h3><strong>1) Open an IRA</strong></h3>\n<p>If you haven’t already, now may be as good a time as any to open an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). IRAs are long term investments that allow you to save money for the future in a tax efficient way. They also offer catch up contributions if you’re over 50.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Traditional vs. Roth</em></strong></p>\n<p>Traditional IRAs allow you to deduct contributions the year in which they are made, then pay taxes when you withdraw the money. A Roth IRA allows you to pay taxes on your contributions now, rather than upon withdrawal and earnings and distributions may not be taxable if held in the Roth IRA for up to 5 years.</p>\n<p>For older investors who are approaching retirement, traditional IRAs probably make more sense, as their tax rate may likely be lower in retirement than it is currently. Younger investors, however, may want to consider a Roth IRA if they believe their tax rate could be higher in the future than when they make their contributions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Contribution Limitations</em></strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of whether you elect to contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA the IRS sets annual limits each year stating the maximum individuals can contribute to their IRA based on their annual earnings. For instance, in 2015 you are limited to a maximum of <strong>$5,500</strong> annually (or <strong>$6,500</strong> if you are 50 or over).</p>\n<p>Finally, with either type of IRA, there are penalties and taxes for early withdrawals prior to 59 ½ years old!</p>\n<p>Please consult your tax professional regarding your specific situation and the specific rules that apply to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2) Consider alternative forms of IRAs to increase your contribution limits</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are your company’s only employee, or you only have a couple of other employees, you may want to look into setting up either an<strong> SEP-IRA or a SIMPLE-IRA.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>SEP-IRA</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SEP-IRAs</strong> allow you to contribute up to 25% of your salary, or $53,000 (as of 2015) whichever is smaller. This is significantly more than what non-SEP-IRAs allow for.</p>\n<p>Setting up a <strong>SEP-IRA</strong> may be an easy choice if you and your spouse are your only employees, but there can be other costs associated if you have other people working for you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>SIMPLE-IRAs</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SIMPLE-IRAs</strong> provide an alternative that is cheaper for companies with several employees.</p>\n<p>With the <strong>SIMPLE-IRA,</strong> the employer creates an IRA for each employee. Employees have the option to contribute a certain percentage of their income to their IRA. Employers are then required to match that percentage up to a maximum of three percent of the person’s salary, or contribute two percent of each person’s salary into the IRA.</p>\n<p>By creating a <strong>SIMPLE-IRA</strong> the owner is then able to contribute an additional $12,500 ($15,500 for those 50 and over) to his or her own IRA.</p>\n<p>If you have only a few employees working for you and you expect to contribute either the full $12,500 or a large portion of it, there is a good chance that your tax savings may more than pay for the cost of contributing to your employee’s IRAs. Please consult your tax professional for more specific information about how this could affect you and your employees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3) Setup Automatic Deductions</strong></h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, we all have a tendency to procrastinate, and thinking about retirement is often not at the top of our priorities! It’s easy for entrepreneurs and small business owners in particular to become distracted and forget to contribute to your retirement account(s). Automatic deductions solve this problem.</p>\n<p>By setting up your IRA and other retirement accounts to take money directly out of your bank account or paycheck each week (or month,) you can ensure that you contribute as much money as you feel you can, up to the full tax deductible amount, each year. You no longer have to worry about forgetting to, or putting off, contributing.</p>\n<p>With any IRA, think carefully about how much you can realistically contribute. They are considered long term investments and you cannot access the money prior to a specific age without incurring taxes and significant penalties for making early withdrawals. Please make sure you are carefully considering your short and medium term goals. And remember: starting to save early is a good way to get on the road to achieving your goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4) Speak with as Experienced Financial Planner to Help You Create a Plan</strong></h3>\n<p>Taking care of long-term financial goals can be a challenge but fortunately you don’t have to go it alone.

Whether there’s a hot new sector that seems to be on fire, or a classic U.S. company that seems poised for a new burst of life, or, worse, a pundit who keeps warning us not to get caught flat-footed.</p>\n<p>It’s human nature to be attracted to the next shiny new thing. My 2-year old son was perfectly happy playing with his trusty push truck, for instance, until he got a shiny red Matchbox car for his birthday and abandoned the – still very serviceable &#8211; truck.</p>\n<p>It’s also human nature to try to catch winners on the way up and want to abandon the underperformers. But that doesn’t mean it’s always a good idea.</p>\n<p>While the market as a whole has done quite well over the last 20 years &#8211; the S&amp;P 500 has returned approximately 9.9%, and a diversified portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds would have returned 8.7% [1]<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a>– the same can’t be said for the average investor.</p>\n<p>During the 10 year period from 2003- 2013, the average investor’s portfolio only returned 2.6% annually, [2] barely a quarter of what the S&amp;P returned, and not much higher than the rate of inflation.</p>\n<p>What’s the reason for this underperformance?</p>\n<p>By trying to beat the market by chasing performance, by trying to time markets, and by overpaying in fees, investors hurt their returns significantly.</p>\n<h3>Chasing Returns</h3>\n<p>When a particular investment is performing well, investors often get excited and invest more, causing the price to continue to climb. As it does, more investors are attracted to its returns &#8211; even as the stock becomes more expensive &#8211; causing the price to rise even more.</p>\n<p>Eventually however the investment will return to its intrinsic value, and fluctuate slightly around that number.</p>\n<p>When that happens, the investors who tried to chase performance and bought on the more expensive upswing, will lose money or underperform the market.</p>\n<h3>Timing the Market</h3>\n<p>It is not surprising that investors try to time the market. If we were able to predict when markets would top and when they would bottom, we’d all be enjoying extraordinary returns. In reality, however, very few people who try to time the markets actually succeed.</p>\n<p>According to Morningstar, market timing costs the average investor 1.5% annually. For a hypothetical portfolio that returned 8.7% annually, a 1.5% additional ‘expense’ ends up eating up over 17% of the investor’s returns.</p>\n<p>Warren Buffet once said, “the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good.” Famed investor Peter Lynch said, “Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves”. [3]</p>\n<p>If Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch don’t believe in trying to time the market, and studies have shown that strategies that try to time the market have very low success rates, it’s a good sign that you’re probably better off not trying too.</p>\n<h3>Overpaying Fees</h3>\n<p>If you are chasing returns, and trying to time the market, chances are you are making more trades than you would with a buy-and-hold strategy. That means you are paying more fees, which also affects your overall rate of return negatively.</p>\n<h3>A Potential Solution</h3>\n<p>The smarter approach may be to <strong>do less</strong>. Investors have historically hurt their returns by over-trading. Looking at your portfolio too often or constantly checking up on how the markets are doing can be detrimental to your finances if you are prone to reacting too impulsively. Rather than trying to time the market, or always buying the next hot stock or asset class, investors tend to have more success by taking a hands off approach.</p>\n<p>Yes, his red Matchbox car is shiny and bright. But, as my son grows up, I hope he’ll learn to value the tried and true as well. And smart investors do the same, thinking carefully before they leap into the next big thing, or try to catch the current wave and ride it to the top.</p>\n<p>Sometimes doing less is doing more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor to determine if your current portfolio and your current strategy are appropriate for your individual investment needs.</p>\n<p>1) https://www.jpmorganfunds.com/blobcontentheader/202/900/1158474868049_jp-littlebook.pdf  (page 65)</p>\n<p>2) http://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2014/04/24/why-the-average-investors-investment-return-is-so-low/</p>\n<p>3) http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/your-money/forget-market-timing-and-stick-to-a-balanced-fund.html?_r=0</p>\n<p>LFS-1189812-050415</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"1e71ea26-57f3-5c2e-808c-4f40c08498ed","slug":"10-important-things-to-discuss-before-marriage","title":"10 Important Things To Discuss Before Marriage","content":"<h3>10 Things to Discuss Before the Big Day</h3>\n<p>You are excited, in love, and planning the wedding of your dreams. Probably the only money questions on your mind are the down payments for the caterers and the florists!</p>\n<p>Yet &#8211; whether your wedding reflects a minimalist sensibility or is a no-holds-barred extravaganza &#8211; it&#8217;s better to have a good understanding of each other&#8217;s finances <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">before</span> the “I Do’s”. This is a time when procrastination could cost you a bundle, even if neither one of you currently have a lot of assets.</p>\n<p>Getting married is more than just substituting the word <strong>“ours”</strong> for <strong>“yours”</strong> and <strong>“mine”</strong>.  It&#8217;s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions &#8211; even your music &#8211; and making all of that <strong>“ours</strong><strong>”</strong> too. Since a significant part of those dreams and aspirations involve money, having multiple financial conversations before marriage (or right after, if you&#8217;re newlyweds!) can help you start married life on a firmer footing, with regard to financial goals.</p>\n<h3><strong>Here are a few conversations that will get your marriage off to a smoother financial start:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong> 1) Views on money.</strong> How we feel about money is often very emotional and very personal. Our family’s views on money can have a big impact on the way we see finances. In some families money may not be talked about. In others, one partner may hide money or spending from the other. While we might not consciously have these same behaviors, our upbringing will have an impact on how we feel about money and how we save, spend, and budget.</p>\n<p>The best way to address unconscious &#8211; and sometimes conflicting &#8211; money behaviors is to start by recognizing how you each feel about money. Then you can take a practical approach and implement the best strategies from the past and incorporate them into your new relationship. This will also give you a chance to address any not-so-beneficial attitudes and behaviors and work to consciously change them.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Spending/Saving Habits</strong>. Chances are the two of you don&#8217;t spend and save money the same way. The interesting thing about spending and saving habits is that they give insight into priorities, both financial and otherwise because we tend to spend money on things we feel are most important and scoff at spending on things we see as unimportant.  Some people value saving more than anything and could be considered “tightwads”. Other people have a “live for today” attitude and spend whatever they have available, saving nothing or little for later. Most of us find ourselves somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p>Not agreeing on spending priorities can lead to serious conflicts down the line. While there is no right and wrong answer regarding priorities and habits, it&#8217;s valuable to know and understand each other’s habits earlier rather than later.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Divvying Up the Bills.</strong> This is an important conversation about how you will manage your money together. Will you have separate or joint accounts? Who will be responsible for paying the bills and investing for long term goals? A realistic understanding both of your current incomes and current debts is important so you can create a realistic budget based on your combined income and expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Credit History.</strong> No one likes to talk about credit ratings because they highlight past mistakes and spending habits. Yet it&#8217;s essential to know and discuss your credit histories. This can help you talk about past money mistakes, current debt loads, and how to address any issues that are lurking. Having this conversation now will also help if you&#8217;re planning to borrow money for a large purchase, such as a home or car; credit history will effect how much you&#8217;ll pay in interest for loans, as well as how much it will cost for things like insurance. Many companies even pull credit for potential job applicants. When it comes to credit, it&#8217;s best not to have surprises down the road, so have the conversation now.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Risk Tolerance and Financial Goals.</strong> Couples often have very strong &#8211; and differing &#8211; feelings about risk and money that are deeply rooted in past experiences.  Your family may have gone through periods of unemployment, for instance, or  you may have grown up taking financial security for granted. One of your parents may have owned a business and you saw it go bankrupt,  so you might be very conservative with your money and not want to take unnecessary chances. Or perhaps they invested in a business that was a huge success.</p>\n<p>Everyone brings a different level of comfort when it comes to risk tolerance and it&#8217;s important to understand your partner&#8217;s because it has an impact on spending and savings habits &#8211; everything from where you invest to how much money you want to set aside. Money provides a level of security that can be very powerful and risk tolerance is directly linked to that feeling of security.</p>\n<p><strong> 6) Ongoing Financial Obligations.</strong> If this is a second marriage, are there child support or alimony payments that need to be considered in the budget process? If so, how much and how long will the obligations need to be fulfilled. Caring for elderly parents might also be a long term expense you will be facing as a couple.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Net Worth.</strong> When it&#8217;s a first marriage, often neither partner has much in the way of assets, but if one partner has more than the other, are you going to want a pre-nuptial agreement? When discussing net worth it is valuable to discuss not only current net worth, but also aspiring net worth. What household income level are you both hoping to achieve. Will reaching those aspirations include additional education? Will it mean switching jobs several times early in your career? Will it mean working 80 hours a week for decades? As a couple, understanding financial expectations and future net worth aspirations will help you plan a life together that will meet both of your needs, financially and emotionally.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Family Plans.</strong> The family size you hope to have will also have a big impact on your financial needs. Children, as wonderful as they are, are very expensive to raise. Do you both want to have children and, if so, one child or several children? Discussions about how the children will be raised and educated are also valuable from a financial perspective. Will one of you stay home to raise the children? Will you pay for day care? How far apart should the children be? Each of these answers will have a significant financial impact to the family budget.</p>\n<p><strong> 9) Combining Physical and Financial Assets.</strong> Particularly with couples getting married later, both partners will have accumulated possessions that now need to be combined. This can be as simple as which sofa and bedroom set to keep, or more complicated when multiple homes, retirement accounts, and other investments are brought into the mix. Discussing whether property, accounts, and debt should be left in individual names or held jointly is also an important conversation to have.</p>\n<p><strong>10) Wills, Trusts, and Life Insurance.</strong> When you&#8217;re getting married, you don’t really want to think about death. Yet wills, trusts, and life insurance need to be updated soon after you say, <strong>“I Do.”</strong> This is true especially if you have assets or children. The process of obtaining a will or trust is fairly straightforward; it’s the discussions that lead up to it that provide the most value. Both of you should have a good understanding of what you have and what you want to happen, should the unthinkable occur.</p>\n<p>Financial advisors can be a real asset, when it comes to pre-marital financial discussions. They can help you determine when it is best to hold assets jointly or separately. Assistance with budgeting and planning for long term goals will help you create a strong financial plan. Advisors can also guide you in building a strategy for reaching financial milestones.</p>\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re getting married (or just got married), <strong>congratulations</strong>! And while these discussions may not be the most romantic ones you&#8217;re having, they do have the ability to bring you closer together. Planning together and sharing your dreams will give you better insight into the mind and heart of the person you&#8217;ve fallen in love with and allow you to become stronger partners when it comes to reaching your goals as a couple, emotional as well as financial.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Not taking advantage of the opportunity to save now may end up costing you later. So how can you start to build your savings <em>and</em> pay down debt, while still maintaining a reasonable quality of life?</p>\n<p>The good news is that &#8211; because they&#8217;re used to a struggling economy &#8211; Millennials have become very resourceful when it comes to finances. Here are several factors to consider when you&#8217;re deciding how much you can &#8211; or even if you can &#8211; allocate for both.</p>\n<h3>Three Questions to consider about saving vs. debt:</h3>\n<p><strong>What is my monthly incoming &amp; outgoing cash flow? </strong>Hopefully it&#8217;s not negative! If it is, though, try to find daily and household expenses that can be trimmed or eliminated (that venti caramel latte? An expensive cable package?) If it&#8217;s positive, determine if there&#8217;s enough left over to pay credit card minimums while allocating a portion, however small, toward a saving plan.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the interest rate on my debt?</strong> Debt with an interest rate of higher than 5% is a priority to pay down, otherwise you&#8217;re spending your hard-earned cash on borrowing costs. Can you roll over your debt to a lower-interest or zero-interest credit card? If not, create an action plan to pay off high-interest debt first. If you have debt with interest rates that are lower than<strong> 5%</strong>, consider contributing to a <strong>401K</strong> or a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. The same way interest compounds with your debts, it also grows with your savings, so the sooner you take action, the more you will gain over time.</p>\n<p><strong>What is my stress level regarding debt?</strong> If the stress of having debt is overwhelming, then make paying the debt before contributing to your savings a priority. If your debt seems manageable, start getting in the habit of making monthly contributions to a savings plan.</p>\n<p>Remember, no two people, and no two financial plans, are alike. Whether you can contribute to a savings plan and pay down debt simultaneously depends on you and your unique situation. Talking to a financial advisor can help put you on a path that is right for you. The important thing is to create a goal and a plan!</p>\n<p>Learn more about our <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-budgeting-and-saving/\">Budgeting and Savings planning</a>.</p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-maximize-your-credit-score/\">What’s your Credit Score?</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brad Sherman is a financial planner who is committed to helping individuals and families achieve financial independence and gain confidence with regard to financial issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Call or contact him today to see if his services are a good fit for your needs.</span></p>\n<p id=\":r0\" class=\"hP\" tabindex=\"-1\">LFS-989662-081314</p>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"14e27a5b-5547-5c0f-807a-b1b2702789ad","slug":"the-psychology-of-investing-whats-your-investor-personality","title":"The Psychology of Investing: What&#8217;s Your Investor Personality?","content":"<p>When it comes to money and investing, there are many factors that contribute to the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221; of important decisions. According to many Behavioral Finance studies, our different personalities traits &amp; preferences, along with a range of emotional and mental behavioral biases, have a strong impact on the way we invest.</p>\n<h2>Investor Personality Types</h2>\n<p>There are 4 different types of investors, according to the CFA Institute,* each with their own distinct behavioral biases. Understanding your own investor personality type can go a long way toward helping you determine and meet your long term investment goals, as well as producing better returns.</p>\n<p>Which of these profiles best describes you?</p>\n<p><strong>Preservers</strong> are investors who place a great deal of emphasis on financial security and on preserving wealth rather than taking risks to grow wealth. Preservers watch closely over their assets and are anxious about losses and short-term performance. They may also have trouble taking action for fear of making the wrong investments decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Accumulators</strong> are investors who are interested in accumulating wealth and are confident they can do so. Accumulators tend to want to steer the ship when it comes to making investment decisions. They are risk takers and typically believe that whatever path they choose is the correct one. Accumulators have frequently been successful in prior business endeavors and are confident that they will make successful investors as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Followers</strong> are investors who tend to follow the lead of their friends and colleagues, a general investing fad, or the status quo, rather than having their own ideas or making their own decisions about investing.  Followers may lack interest and/or knowledge of the financial markets and their decision-making process may lack a long-term plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Independents</strong> are investors who have original ideas about investing and like to be involved in the investment process. Unlike Followers, they are very interested in the process of investing, and are engaged in the financial markets. Many Independents are analytical and critical thinkers and trust themselves to make confident and informed decisions, but risk the pitfalls of only following their own research.</p>\n<h2>The Psychology Of Investing Biases</h2>\n<p>Behavioral biases affect us all as investors and can vary depending upon our investor personality type. These biases can be cognitive: a tendency to think and act in a certain way or follow a “rule of thumb.” Biases can also be emotional: a tendency to take action based on feeling rather than fact.</p>\n<p>According to a study done by H. Kent Baker and Victor Ricciardi on <a href=\"http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=512\">How Biases Affect Investor Behavior</a>, here are 8 biases that can affect investment decisions:</p>\n<p><strong>Anchoring or Confirmation Bias:</strong> First impressions can be hard to shake because we tend to selectively filter, paying more attention to information that supports our opinions, while ignoring the rest. Likewise, we often resort to preconceived opinions when encountering something, or someone, new. An investor whose thinking is subject to confirmation bias would be more likely to look for information that supports his or her original idea about an investment rather than seek out information that contradicts it.</p>\n<p><strong>Regret Aversion Bias:</strong> Also known as loss aversion, regret aversion describes wanting to avoid the feeling of regret experienced after making a choice with a negative outcome. Investors who are influenced by anticipated regret take less risk because it lessens the potential for poor outcomes. Regret aversion can explain an investor &#8216;s reluctance to sell “losing” investments to avoid confronting the fact that they have made poor decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition Effect Bias</strong>: This refers to a tendency to label investments as ‘winners’ or ‘losers.’ Disposition effect bias can lead an investor to hang on to an investment that no longer has any upside or sell a winning investment too early to make up for previous losses. This is harmful because it can increase capital gains taxes and can reduce returns even before taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>Hindsight Bias:</strong> Another common perception bias is hindsight bias, which leads an investor to believe &#8211; after the fact &#8211; that the onset of a past event was predictable and completely obvious whereas, in fact, the event could not have been reasonably predicted.</p>\n<p><strong>Familiarity Bias:</strong>  This occurs when investors have a preference for familiar or well known investments despite the seemingly obvious gains from diversification. The investor may feel anxiety when diversifying investments between well known domestic securities and lesser known international securities, as well as between both familiar and unfamiliar stocks and bonds that are outside of a &#8220;comfort zone.&#8221; This can lead to suboptimal portfolios with a greater a risk of losses.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-Attribution Bias</strong>: Investors who suffer from self-attribution bias tend to attribute successful outcomes to their own actions and bad outcomes to external factors. They often exhibit this bias as a means of self-protection or self-enhancement. Investors affected by self-attribution bias may become overconfident.</p>\n<p><strong>Trend-chasing Bias</strong>: Investors often chase past performance in the mistaken belief that historical returns predict future investment performance. This tendency is complicated by the fact that some product issuers may increase advertising when past performance is high, in order to attract new investors. Research demonstrates, however, that investors do not benefit because performance as frequently as not fails to persist in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Worry</strong>: The act of worrying is a natural, and common, human emotion. Worry evokes memories and creates visions of possible future scenarios that alter an investor’s judgment about personal finances. Anxiety about an investment increases its perceived risk and lowers the level of risk tolerance.  To avoid this bias, investors should match their level of risk tolerance with an appropriate asset allocation strategy.</p>\n<h3>Which investor personality best describes you and which biases are you predisposed to?</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Working with a financial planner can help investors to avoid making investment decisions based on biases.

If you get started now, you&#8217;ll be maximizing your chances of hitting those marks on your way to achieving your goals!</p>\n<p>Here are some basic tips to help you get started.</p>\n<h3>7 Tips For The Long Term Investor</h3>\n<p>● <b>Start today</b><b>:</b> Procrastination can put a large dent in your ultimate savings. Whether you&#8217;re investing in a retirement savings plans or a regular investment account, it&#8217;s important to start early so that your investments compound. Remember, even small amounts add up over time!</p>\n<p>● <b>Create a plan and stick with it:</b> There are many ways to be successful and no one strategy is inherently better than any other. Once you find your style, stick with it. Bouncing in and out of the market makes is just as likely you will miss some of the best days and hit the worst.  Readjust your portfolio when necessary, but not too often.</p>\n<p>● <b>Think long term and be disciplined:</b> Be prepared to buy and hold your positions. Big short-term profits can be enticing when you&#8217;re new to the market but short-term wins will get you off track. Start a program, stay invested, and don’t be too concerned with day-to-day profits and losses.  Warren Buffet once asked, “Suppose you’re going to be investing for the next several years. Do you want the price of the stocks to go up or down?&#8221; While everybody assumes it&#8217;s &#8220;up,&#8221; in reality, it’s only people who are withdrawing in the near future who really want stocks to go up!</p>\n<p>● <b>Do your research:</b> Always be an informed investor. Do your own due diligence with companies you&#8217;re interested in. Don’t go for a ‘hot tip’ just because there&#8217;s a lot of buzz; research companies, get advice, and decide if they&#8217;re investments that are right for you.</p>\n<p>● <b>Never let your emotions influence you:</b> The markets move in cycles. When the markets are up, we feel elated about our investment decisions. When markets start to move down, we may experience anxiety and panic. Reacting emotionally can lead to spur of the moment decisions that don&#8217;t benefit you in the long run. Again: think long term.</p>\n<p>● <b>Always have a margin of safety:</b> The first rule anyone new to investing needs to learn is that there are no guarantees in the stock market. An investment that looks great on paper does not always pan out in real life.  Know how much risk you are willing to take and make sure your investments are aligned with your risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>● <b>Diversify:</b> Never put all your eggs in one kind of basket. It&#8217;s important to make sure your portfolio includes both stocks and yield-producing assets, such as bonds, to cushion you against market volatility. Diversification doesn&#8217;t just mean investing in multiple companies either; investigate ways to invest in different markets, bother national and international, as well.</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">One final tip: find an experienced financial planner you trust, who &#8220;gets&#8221; you, your goals, and your timeline, and who can guide you as you invest in your future.</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brad Sherman is a financial planner who is committed to helping individuals and families achieve financial independence and gain confidence with regard to financial issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Call or contact him today to see if his services are a good fit for your needs.</span></p>\n<h3>Related Reading:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dollar-cost-averaging/\">What is Dollar Cost Averaging?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-things-investors-get-wrong/\">5 Things Investors Get Wrong</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-big-picture-things-many-investors-dont/\">5 Big Picture Things Many Investors Don’t Do</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/how-to-get-started-investing/\">Why and How to Get Started Investing Today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investment-volatility/\">Mitigating Your Investment Volatility</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-psychology-of-investing/\">The Psychology of Investing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/rebalance-your-portfolio-to-stay-on-track/\">Rebalance Your Portfolio to Stay on Track With Investments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-investing/\">Behavioral Investing: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus!</a></p>\n<p id=\":4pl\" class=\"hP\" tabindex=\"-1\">LFS-996518-082214</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span></p>\n</div>\n","featured_media":null}},{"node":{"id":"0044639a-1544-5b2c-929c-d5b02c0a566e","slug":"discussing-personal-finance-is-difficult-for-many-but-critical","title":"Discussing Personal Finance is Difficult for Many &#8211; but Critical","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Money can be a difficult subject for any of us to talk about, although it seems to be particularly challenging, statistically, for women. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/most-women-feel-more-comfortable-talking-to-a-doctor-than-to-a-financial-adviser-2015-2\">a recent study released by Fidelity</a>, 80% of women surveyed said that they had refrained from discussing financial issues with friends or family, despite the fact that over 92% of those surveyed expressed an interest in learning more about financial planning. Among those surveyed, some of the most common reasons given were that money was too personal a topic, it felt uncomfortable to talk about, or it was considered &#8220;taboo.&#8221; Additionally, women are also more likely to feel that they don’t know enough about the subject to speak about it intelligently. This is despite the fact that <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/women-make-investors/story?id=15039090\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">studies have shown that women tend to be better investors than men.</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Money is, however, a critical subject that we all need to discuss &#8211; and discuss often &#8211; in relationships. A little while ago I wrote about the </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/7-things-married-couples-discuss-today/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">7 Things Married Couples Should Discuss Today</span></a><span class=\"s1\">, where I talked about why it is critical that married couples go over their finances together. Marriage is not, however, the only relationship that requires having difficult conversations about money. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to communicate with our parents and children about money, and even friends, coworkers and extended family members in some cases.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With money playing such an important role in our daily lives, it&#8217;s critical that we learn to overcome our desire to avoid the topic and learn how to effectively and confidently communicate about financial matters. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fortunately there are a few things you can do to make the topic of money easier to discuss:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. Realize that difficult conversations are sometimes necessary</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether you need to confront your parents about their retirement plans, your spouse about where to allocate investments, or your children about their spending habits money can be a difficult topic to talk about. By reminding yourself that these are conversations that you will ultimately need to have however you are setting yourself up for success.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. Find someone knowledgeable about finances who you can trust</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No one has all the answers when it comes to money, which is why it is often helpful to turn to others for ideas and suggestions. You should find someone &#8211; whether it’s a friend, family member or a financial advisor &#8211; who is knowledgeable, who you know has your best interests at heart, and with whom you feel comfortable speaking.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will give you the opportunity to ask questions, bounce around ideas, and learn and grow. It will also give you the confidence to discuss finances with others.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. Get educated</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the best ways to feel comfortable discussing money with others is by learning as much about the subject as you can. Read books, ask questions, and get help when needed. By learning as much as you can, you feel more comfortable giving advice, making financial decisions and having what would otherwise be difficult conversations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. Don’t procrastinate when discussing finances</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If there is a money-related conversation that you have been putting off, bring it up now or at the next time possible. Don’t wait!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">H</span><span class=\"s2\">ere</span><span class=\"s1\"> are a few more suggestions for important conversation starters:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your spouse:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Family’s budget</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Retirement savings</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Saving for children’s college fund</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Where to invest money</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your children:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allowance</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Spending</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Basic financial principles</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With your parents:<br />\n</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Their retirement plans</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Location of legal documents including wills, trusts and insurance paperwork</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;re like most people, chances are there are many other subjects that you need to discuss with those you&#8217;re close to.

The media loves to paint Millennials as “<strong>adventurous</strong>”, “<strong>risk takers</strong>,” and “<strong>thrill seekers</strong>.” But, surprisingly, when it comes to financial planning for Millennials, their behavior is <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/millennials-fiscally-conservative/\">anything but risky</a>.</p>\n<p>In fact, there is evidence that, while emotions and biases play a large part in Millennials&#8217; investment decisions,  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fear-keeps-millennials-investing-sidelines/\"><strong>fear</strong> leads the list of behavioral influences</a>.</p>\n<p>We Millennials grew up during the Internet crash and have witnessed one of the most turbulent market cycles in recent U.S. history. With the financial crisis of 2008, and the housing bust leading to a recession, many of us have watched our parents struggle with financial security and worry about whether they&#8217;ll ever be able to retire. Many recent grads have experienced unemployment as a result of the crisis, and many are burdened with significant student loan debt. Good times? Not.</p>\n<p>These experiences during their impressionable years have led many Millennials to take an emotionally driven approach to Financial Planning for Millennials and to adopt conservative money habits that analysts have compared to the investment behavior of young adults during the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>They tend to be wary of investing in equities, for instance, resorting to a behavioral bias that favors peer narratives and unscientific anecdotes – such as stories of retirement-age people whose nest eggs were destroyed by the financial crisis &#8211; over careful data analysis.</p>\n<p>In May 2013, Wells Fargo released the results of a study surveying more than 1,400 Millennials, that found that Millennials <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/millennials-time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-stock-market/\">view the stock market</a>, and most investments, as a risk not worth taking. More than half of Millennials are “<strong>not very confident</strong>” or “<strong>not at all confident</strong>” about the stock market and many of the Millennials who do consider investing in stocks see the market as a short-term investment. The survey also found that Millennials&#8217; primary concerns were student loan debt and paying their monthly bills.</p>\n<p>In fact, Millennials have not only taken on more student loan debt than any previous generation but they continue to struggle in a challenging job market. With many Millennials remaining unemployed or underemployed, and with bills and debt as their top priorities, they have very little disposable income for investing. Many, according to a Pew Research poll released in October 2013, did not even begin thinking about saving or establishing a 401(k) until about five years into their careers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a UBS Wealth Management survey report featured on <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com\">Bankrate.com</a> found that, more 39% of the Millennials surveyed &#8211; more than any other age group &#8211; said that cash is their preferred way to invest money that they don&#8217;t need for at least ten years. That&#8217;s three times the number who chose to invest in the stock market, despite the fact that the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> has gained 17% over the past year while most cash investment yields remain below 1%.</p>\n<h3>The Danger of Playing it Safe</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The problem with short-term stock investment approaches and dipping in and out of the stock market is that it can work against investors, because short-term investments may be subject to a higher rate of <strong>volatility</strong>. Instead of looking at the long-term data, which shows that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/tips-millennials-understanding-stock-market/\">stocks typically outperform</a> other more conservative asset classes over the long run, those young investors are fearful of the short-range volatility, clouding data about the positive potential of long-term investing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">That reluctance to get into the market can be <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/generation-long-term-financial-goals/\">problematic for long-term portfolio</a> growth because, without the returns from stocks, it can be difficult to reach savings and retirement goals.</span></p>\n<h3>Bigger is Not Always Better…When Finding a Financial Advisor</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">With the crash of the big banks and the negative publicity surrounding Wall Street financial firms, Millennials became a generation that looked at financial professionals with mistrust. Instead, they rely more heavily on the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/where-millennials-can-turn-for-financial-advice/\"><strong>Internet</strong>, <strong>social media</strong>, and <strong>personal networks</strong> for financial advice</a>. Their experience with market volatility and lack of job security has had a significant impact on their attitudes and behaviors toward investing. With very little disposable income after bills and debt payment, Millennials want to feel a sense of security with their investments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">When it comes to working with a financial professional, ‘old school’, traditional banking services are of no interest to them. Bigger is not better in their minds; a <strong>smaller, more independent financial planning firm</strong> may be able to offer a more hands-on and collaborative approach to investing that Millennials feel more comfortable with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">It’s important to Millennials that they find <strong>someone they can trust</strong> and who can relate to their concerns and be open to new ideas and methods of investing. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Sherman Wealth Management </a>understands that being a part of the investing process is a must in financial planning for Millennials. We fill a role for clients who can no longer relate to, or trust, the large financial institutions that once held a stronghold in the marketplace. The professionals at Sherman Wealth Management provide a personalized plan for investing and help our clients navigate through the difficulty of prioritizing financial obligations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Remember how it was the overconfidence of the large financial firms and irresponsible investors that brought us the financial crisis in the first place?

Even if you had put the money in a savings account over the year, you still would be better off.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How to Minimize Your Refund</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to adjust the amount that is withheld for the IRS each pay period you need to fill out/change your W-4 form.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The W-4 allows you to specify allowances or exemptions that you are eligible for.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">These can include:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Donations to charitable organizations</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interest on a home mortgage</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interest on student loan debt</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Contributions to traditional IRAs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The W-4 form estimates the amount that you would receive from a tax refund. This amount is then distributed over the number of weeks remaining in the tax year, lowering the amount withheld from your paycheck each pay period.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You should also look into filling out a new W-4 every time you have experienced a major change in your life. Examples of this include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Switching jobs</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marriage</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Having a child</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Losing a dependent (They either file their own tax return, or you can no longer claim them)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While trying to lower the amount that is withheld in taxes each pay period generally makes sense, it may be prudent to not list all of the exemptions you are eligible for on your W-4.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why You May Not Want to Claim all Your Allowances</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While having too much in taxes withheld can be compared to lending the Government money at a rate of zero percent interest, the reverse is also true. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you underpay in taxes each paycheck, you end up owing money to the Government. In theory this is great. You could put the money in a savings account, and then at the end of the year pay back the Government while pocketing the interest that you collected. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In practice however this is not a prudent strategy for most people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Individuals have a tendency to spend money that they have, and forget about longer-term consequences of their actions. Additionally while receiving a refund at the end of the year is exciting, the opposite is also true.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is why it may make sense for you to leave a few deductions you are eligible for unlisted on your W-4. This ensures that you receive a tax refund, albeit a smaller one, rather than owing money.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What to Do When You Do Receive a Refund</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While this advice can be helpful for next year, chances are this year’s tax season will provide you with a large refund.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you do receive a large refund there are a series of things you can consider to maximize its value. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Invest in yourself – Sometimes the best investment you can make is in yourself. Consider buying a book or taking a class to help improve your performance in work or at life.</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Get your will done – this can often cost less than a $1,000 in total but can save your beneficiary’s significantly more both in terms of money as well as headache</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Put money into a college savings plan </span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay down your mortgage</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Invest in a non-tax-exempt account – if you have already maxed out your IRA</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Save for a rainy day</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Open/add to an IRA</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay off student loan debt</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pay off credit card debt – if you have any credit card debt, this should be an immediate priority</span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Save the money and increase your 401(k) contributions – put your money in a safe place such as a savings account, and bump up your 401(k) contributions to reflect the fact that you have this money sitting on the side.</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of what you do with your tax refund, it is important that you come up with a plan. A trusted financial planner can help you in the process of creating one.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With over a decade’s worth of experience in the financial services industry <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\">Brad Sherman</a> is committed to helping individual investors plan and prepare for retirement.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.
