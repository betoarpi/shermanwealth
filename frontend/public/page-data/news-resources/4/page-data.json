Bad habits — whether it’s biting our nails, overeating, smoking or something else — create roadblocks on the path to becoming our best selves.</p>\n<p>And it’s no different when it comes to our finances. Bad money habits can have damaging, long-term consequences for our financial security. But developing healthy financial habits can do wonders for helping us achieve our long-term goals like <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">saving enough for retirement</a> or paying for a child’s college education.</p>\n<p>The earlier you develop healthy financial habits, the better your chances of successfully meeting your goals. Here are four financial habits you should start working on today:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Separate spending on ‘needs’ and ‘wants’</strong></h3>\n<p>This is the first step in developing healthy habits. You need to understand where your money is going and then figure out where you need to allocate it to make the best use of it.</p>\n<p>Sticking to a spending plan and avoiding impulse buying is crucial for building a healthy savings plan. Create a simple budget that shows you how much money you are bringing in and helps you understand your monthly spending. Add up all of your expenses that you would consider a need — this includes your monthly savings amount, rent, car payment, cable and internet bill, food, etc. (By including your savings amount in your need category, you create an automatic savings plan for yourself — more on that below.) Subtract that total from your income, and what is left over is your free <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">cash flow</a>.</p>\n<p>The remaining money is the amount you have at your disposal for your “want” expenses. At the very least, make sure you are not spending more than that. At the end of the month, if you still have money left over, stick it in your savings or investment account. This removes the temptation to spend it and lets you start the next month fresh again. If you consistently have money left over, increase your savings amount.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Set up automatic savings</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating a consistent savings mechanism will ensure you are saving a minimum amount each month or paycheck, making progress toward your longer-term goals. Whether you are saving into an investment account or your bank savings account, set up an automatic contribution from each of your paychecks so that the money is “out of sight, out of mind” and you won’t be tempted to spend it.</p>\n<p>Why is this so important? Without having an automatic savings plan, you could be saving $500 one month and then $0 the next. Although this is better than not saving at all, it is not a good practice to adopt. And remember, you can start small. Even if it’s $100 a month, saving consistently will pay off immensely down the road.<em> </em></p>\n<h3><strong>3. Participate in your employer-sponsored retirement plan</strong></h3>\n<p>Saving for retirement is one of the most important financial habits you can build for yourself. The power of tax-deferred investment growth over your entire career can really add up. Another benefit with 401(k)s and other retirement plans is that the money you contribute is pretax, which effectively lowers your taxable income, reducing your tax liability today.</p>\n<p>If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k) based on your contribution level, it’s especially important to contribute enough to take advantage of this benefit. The employer is basically offering you free money that you would be turning down. For instance, an employer may offer a retirement savings plan to which you can contribute up to 5% of your salary and it will match up to 3% of that. If you don’t contribute at least 3%, you are in effect saying no to a 3% raise.</p>\n<p>If your employer does not offer a retirement savings plan, look into opening a self-directed retirement account such as an IRA so you can benefit from tax-advantaged retirement saving.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Start investing now</strong></h3>\n<p>Time is the greatest advantage investors have when it comes to saving and investing early and consistently. With the power of <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">compound interest</a>, even small amounts can really add up over the years. With compound interest, your interest amount is added to the principal, increasing the amount of interest you earn, even if the rate of return does not change. To take advantage of compound interest, the earlier you start saving, the better.</p>\n<p>If you can boost your savings rate, you’ll be even better off in the event of a long period of low investment returns, according to Michael Batnick, director of research for investment firm Ritholtz Wealth Management. “<a href=\"http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2016/05/19/how-to-stack-the-odds-in-your-favor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Saving more money can offset lower returns </a>because you’re compounding on top of compounding,” Batnick writes. He points to a comparison of two portfolios over a 20-year period, both starting with contributions of $5,000 a year. The portfolio earning an average of 4% annually, with contributions increased by 10% each year, will have $100,000 more in it compared with a portfolio earning 6% a year, with contributions raised by only 5% ($393,153 vs. $293,534).</p>\n<h3>Prioritize your goals</h3>\n<p>If you already have these good financial habits, that’s great. If not, the best time to start developing them is now. Everyone will have their own goals and needs, and, unfortunately, not all of those can be satisfied at the same time. You’ll have to prioritize your goals, but once you do, you can start building healthy habits that will allow you to reach them. Separating your needs from your wants, saving early and often, taking advantage of tax-favored retirement savings plans, and investing now can help you build a solid financial foundation and get you where you want to go.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/4-healthy-financial-habits-develop-now-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NerdWallet.com</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

In light of a new Department of Labor rule requiring all financial advisors to act as fiduciaries for retirement accounts, </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in which we strongly believe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Oliver skewered the opaque tendencies of brokers and traditional financial advisors. He urges viewers to bring their business to a transparent fiduciary who has your best interest at heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oliver’s segment serves an important purpose — many regular people who trust a traditional financial advisor with their money, or millennials who are just now beginning to think about retirement planning, simply don’t know the many ways the advisor could be robbing them of their hard-earned money. While not everyone is as clueless as the woman whom Oliver ridicules for asking CNBC host Suze Orman whether she should spend $4,000 to get an elf-spotting certification in Iceland, the many ways traditional financial advisors hurt their clients are often hidden unless the client does the digging themselves. With that in mind, here are four major takeaways from Oliver’s monologue.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>1. Many financial advisors may not have your best interest at heart — but you can find one who does.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Oliver notes, “financial advisor” is a vague term. Even so, many traditional financial advisors  are not fiduciaries, and instead operate on commission. (<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">An advisor who is a fiduciary</a> must always act in the best interests of you, the client.) This means they can execute trades and strategies that line their own pockets with little regard for your financial well-being. We believe that this is unacceptable; as a result, we operate as a fee-only fiduciary that does not receive any sort of commission. While some advisors make money by endorsing a particular investment or product to their clients, we are paid only by our clients.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. The “active management” of many funds and advisors can destroy your capital.</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we’ve previously detailed </span><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in this blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you shouldn&#8217;t expect to win with actively managed funds. Not only do these funds fail to outperform the market, but in doing so they also accrue massive fees due to the large amount of trades they are making. While compound interest grows your investment over time, interest isn’t the only thing that compounds — fees do as well. Oliver cites a study in which an index of stocks, selected by a cat throwing a ball at them, outperformed an actively managed fund overseen by experts. The cat earned returns of 7%, while the pros garnered only 3.5%. Oliver summarizes the situation succinctly: “If you stick around doing nothing while everyone else around you [messes] up, you’re going to win big.” At Sherman Wealth Management, we believe sticking with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">investments that focus on low cost and tax efficiency</a> is the best way to save for the long term. ETFs are an investment vehicle that we utilize to accomplish this goal. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>3. It doesn’t have to be this complicated, and it might be getting simpler.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are easy steps you can take. Start saving now — it’s never too early. When screening financial advisors, ask if they are fiduciaries. With your money in the hands of a fiduciary who puts your best interest first, you can be confident in your advisor’s motivations. </span></p>\n<p>Feel like the little guy/girl who can&#8217;t get the time of day from your &#8220;financial advisor&#8221;? Read our post &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/\">Why Go Where Your Money&#8217;s Not Wanted?</a></p>\n<h3><strong>4. These principles aren’t abstract — they have real consequences for real people, like you.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To demonstrate all of this, Oliver examined the 401k his own employees at HBO were using through their provider. The retirement fund charged 1.69% fees, and their broker refused to offer low-cost, low-fee plans. The advisor even messed up the calculations on the compounding interest, making his original math off by over $10,000,000. These are not the actions of someone who values his/her clients more than a paycheck; on the other hand, we value our partnership in our clients’ future success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Oliver went wrong is when he questioned why anyone would invite their financial advisor to their wedding. We are proof that a relationship like that is possible between client and advisor. As a fiduciary, when we consistently act in the best interests of our clients, we end up building strong friendships with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sherman Wealth Management, we have long been at the forefront of the fiduciary movement for transparency and conflict-free advice. At a traditional insurance company or wire house, advisors will often recommend expensive funds produced by their institution; on the other hand, we can take a more holistic view of investments to determine which are best for you. We believe in growing with you, not at your expense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We encourage you to trust your retirement to an advisor who will act only in your best interest.

But the reality is that most investors are actually underperforming their benchmark. Two recent articles regarding behavioral finance — <em><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051116/which-investor-personality-best-describes-you/\">Which Investor Personality Best Describes You?</a></em> and <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/051916/8-common-biases-impact-investment-decisions/\"><em>8 Common Investor Biases That Impact Investment Decisions</em></a> — detail a concept which is the thought that our own instinctive behaviors are the biggest challenge to us as investors. Another topic that we have written on is the issue with trying to “time” the market. What people often don’t realize is that these two concepts have more in common than you might think.</p>\n<p>For over two decades, financial research firm Dalbar has been analyzing investor returns. It recently published its 22<sup>nd</sup> annual <em><a href=\"http://www.dalbar.com/ProductsServices/DALBARPresentsQAIB/tabid/357/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior</a></em> study that compared these investor equity fund returns versus the market benchmark. The results showed significant underperformance from investors. <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/04/26/832952/0/en/Better-Investment-Recommendations-equals-Greater-Returns-DALBAR-Annual-Report-of-Investor-Returns-Says-Not-So.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dalbar points out</a> that “for the 30 years ended Dec. 31, 2015, the S&amp;P 500 index produced an annual return of 10.35%, while the average equity mutual fund investor earned only 3.66%. The gap of 6.69 percentage points represents the diminished returns.”</p>\n<p>So why is this the case?</p>\n<p>As advisors, we have long preached the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">importance of cost</a> and the large effects it can have on returns. While cost is a factor in investor underperformance, there are other factors that play even a larger role. The study showed that the biggest contributing factor to equity investors&#8217; underperformance over the past 20 years is voluntary investor behavior. What does that mean? Let’s look at a couple of examples of investor behavior that contributes to underperformance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>1. Panic selling: </strong>The No. 1 rule in a market collapse is not to panic. Markets can be erratic with times of larger-than-normal volatility. Responding emotionally is never a good idea. Start by understanding what your risk tolerance is. At that point, make sure you understand your investments and what their purpose is in your portfolio. Finally, look at your portfolio as a whole and make sure it is aligned properly with your risk tolerance and goals.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>2. Trend chasing/herd mentality/FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):</strong> As the phrase goes: what you see is what you believe. When investors see a stock continue to go up, or everyone around them is talking about buying that stock, it is easy to follow the crowd and jump in without thinking. History has shown us that past performance is no guarantee of future returns.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>3. Overconfidence: </strong>Many investors feel they perform better than what is actually happening or real. This can cause investors to believe they can accurately time the markets.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\"

The <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/13/coming-soon-the-biggest-wealth-transfer-in-history.html\">biggest wealth transfer in history </a>is beginning, as Millennials will soon become the wealth bearing demographic in this county.  Not surprisingly, as we pointed out in a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Personal%20Finance%20Blog\">recent blog post</a>, personal finance is a huge issue for many Millennials. But where can a Millennial turn for advice?</p>\n<p>Goals, dreams, jobs, family plans, etc. are going to vary widely, but there a few common themes that seem relevant across the spectrum. We constantly write on many of these issues, so decided to summarize the topics for you and answer some of those nagging questions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting started</strong> is often the hardest part. Beginning a savings plan early is key, which makes planning all the more important. We constantly preach the importance of determining your short, intermediate and long term goals and then focusing on creating a plan on how to achieve them. Having the “money conversation” is a great way to get started. Remember, it’s not how much you make, but how much you save.

So how do you determine if your focus should be on accelerating the payoff of that debt or maximizing saving instead? We wrote about that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/save-money-pay-debt/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Save%20Money%20or%20Pay%20Down%20Debt\">here</a><u>.</u></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investing</strong> &#8211; Only 26 percent of people under age 30 own stocks, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/more-millennials-say-no-to-stocks-and-advisors-adapt.html\">CNBC story. </a>Time is one of the greatest assets Millennials have working in their favor. Yet  because of various reasons that have scared many away from the stock market, a vast majority of millennials are missing out on <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Volatility%20and%20Compound%20Interest\">potential compound interest</a><u>, and other benefits of long term investing</u>.

Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades. As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first time investors, it’s actually one of the main reasons I created Sherman Wealth Management. It was important to me to make sure top notch financial advice was available to anyone and everyone,  particularly to those who are starting out on the path to wealth accumulation. We created this guide to make sure you are asking your potential financial advisors the right questions to determine if they are right for you. – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=6%20questions%20to%20ask%20advisor\">6 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marriage</strong> &#8211; Getting married is more than just substituting the word “ours” for “yours” and “mine”. It’s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions – even your music – and making all of that “ours” too. If you have started to think about marriage, or are married already, there are a few financial discussions you should be sure you have.  Since a significant part of those pre-marital dreams and aspirations involve money, having multiple financial conversations before marriage (or right after, if you’re newlyweds!) can help you start married life on a firmer footing, with regard to financial goals. Here are two blogs we wrote for those getting married or already married.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/10-things-to-discuss-before-marriage/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=10%20Things%20Before%20Marriage\">10 Things to Discuss Before Marriage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/7-things-married-couples-discuss-today/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=7%20Things%20Married%20Couples%20Should%20Discuss\">7 Things Married Couples Should Discuss Today</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buying a house</strong> &#8211; There are studies out there saying that Millennials are not buying houses. A prudent home purchase often can be one of the most stable and solid investments a young person can make. So why the hesitation? Some Millennials wonder if given the rate increase and current market turmoil – if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now? We wrote about this exact topic <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/do-interest-rates-have-you-worried-about-buying-a-first-home/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Interest%20Rates%20Buying%20House\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kids </strong>&#8211; Babies change your life in many ways, including requiring large amounts of time and money. While you may already be thinking about childcare costs and options, or about paying the medical bills that accompanied your new child, there are several other – important – financial considerations you should be thinking about even before the new baby arrives – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/5-planning-tips-new-parents/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=5%20Planning%20Tips%20for%20New%20Parents\">5 Planning Tips for New Parents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this all seems overwhelming, don’t be discouraged.

In previously discussing behavioral finance, we focused on <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investor-personality-best-describes/\">four common personality types of investors</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s focus on the common behavioral biases that affect our investment decisions.</p>\n<p>The concept of behavioral finance helps us recognize our natural biases that lead us to making illogical and often irrational decisions when it comes to investments and finances. A prime example of this is the concept of prospect theory, which is the idea that as humans, our emotional response to perceived losses is different than to that of perceived gains. According to prospect theory, losses for an investor feel twice as painful as gains feel good. Some investors worry more about the marginal percentage change in their wealth than they do about the amount of their wealth. This thought process is backwards and can cause investors to fixate on the wrong issues.</p>\n<p>The chart below is a great example of this emotional rollercoaster and how it impacts our investment decisions.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/content/advisor_article/8_common_biases_that/image001.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h2>The Psychology of Investing Biases</h2>\n<p>Behavioral biases hit us all as investors and can vary depending upon our investor personality type. These biases can be cognitive, illustrated by a tendency to think and act in a certain way or follow a rule of thumb. Biases can also be emotional: a tendency to take action based on feeling rather than fact.</p>\n<p>Pulled from a <a href=\"http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=286116065002000088064002074106019097023057071055063005125104112022119101005085097014107106052111061028034095091106066028101028102070004033004122011011095091091010055044031092114081116083016100025003099116123064120027097100019064066081120127086022074&amp;EXT=pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> by H. Kent Baker and Victor Ricciardi that looks at how biases impact investor behavior, here are eight biases that can affect investment decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anchoring or Confirmation Bias:</strong> First impressions can be hard to shake because we tend to selectively filter, paying more attention to information that supports our opinions while ignoring the rest. Likewise, we often resort to preconceived opinions when encountering something — or someone — new. An investor whose thinking is subject to confirmation bias would be more likely to look for information that supports his or her original idea about an investment rather than seek out information that contradicts it.</li>\n<li><strong>Regret Aversion Bias: </strong>Also known as loss aversion, regret aversion describes wanting to avoid the feeling of regret experienced after making a choice with a negative outcome. Investors who are influenced by anticipated regret take less risk because it lessens the potential for poor outcomes. Regret aversion can explain an investor&#8217;s reluctance to sell losing investments to avoid confronting the fact that they have made poor decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Disposition Effect Bias: </strong>This refers to a tendency to label investments as winners or losers. Disposition effect bias can lead an investor to hang onto an investment that no longer has any upside or sell a winning investment too early to make up for previous losses. This is harmful because it can increase capital gains taxes and can reduce returns even before taxes.</li>\n<li><strong>Hindsight Bias:</strong> Another common perception bias is hindsight bias, which leads an investor to believe after the fact that the onset of a past event was predictable and completely obvious whereas, in fact, the event could not have been reasonably predicted.</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarity Bias:</strong> This occurs when investors have a preference for familiar or well-known investments despite the seemingly obvious gains from diversification. The investor may feel anxiety when diversifying investments between well known domestic securities and lesser known international securities, as well as between both familiar and unfamiliar stocks and bonds that are outside of his or her comfort zone. This can lead to suboptimal portfolios with a greater a risk of losses.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-attribution Bias:</strong> Investors who suffer from self-attribution bias tend to attribute successful outcomes to their own actions and bad outcomes to external factors. They often exhibit this bias as a means of self-protection or self-enhancement. Investors affected by self-attribution bias may become overconfident.</li>\n<li><strong>Trend-chasing Bias:</strong> Investors often chase past performance in the mistaken belief that historical returns predict future investment performance. This tendency is complicated by the fact that some product issuers may increase advertising when past performance is high to attract new investors. Research demonstrates, however, that investors do not benefit because performance usually fails to persist in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Worry:</strong> The act of worrying is a natural — and common — human emotion. Worry evokes memories and creates visions of possible future scenarios that alter an investor’s judgment about personal finances. Anxiety about an investment increases its perceived risk and lowers the level of risk tolerance. To avoid this bias, investors should match their level of risk tolerance with an appropriate asset allocation strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Avoiding Behavioral Mistakes</h2>\n<p>By understanding the common behavioral mistakes investors make, a quality financial planner will aim to help clients take the emotion out of investing by creating a tactical, strategic investment plan customized to the individual. Some examples of strategies that help with this include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Systematic Asset Allocation: </strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We utilize investment strategies</a> such as dollar cost averaging to create a systematic plan of attack that takes advantage of market fluctuations, even in a down market period.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Mitigation: </strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/investor-risk-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The starting point</a> of any investment plan starts with understanding an individual&#8217;s risk tolerance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important aspect of behavioral finance is peace of mind. By having a thorough understanding of your risk appetite, the purpose of each investment in your portfolio and the implementation plan of your strategy, it allows you to feel much more confident about your investment plan and be less likely to make common behavioral mistakes.</p>\n<p>Working with a financial planner can help investors recognize and understand their own individual behavioral biases and predispositions, and thus be able to avoid making investment decisions based entirely on those biases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

This is commonly referred to as behavioral finance. As part of a two-part series on Behavioral Finance, we will start by exploring the different personality types of most investors. When it comes to money and investing, there are many factors that contribute to the “how” and “why” of important financial decisions.</p>\n<h2>Investor Personality Types</h2>\n<p>There are four different types of investors, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/pwmn.v2012.n1.5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFA Institute</a>, each with their own distinct behavioral biases. Understanding your own investor personality type can go a long way toward helping you determine and meet your long term investment goals, as well as producing better returns. (For more from Brad Sherman, see: <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/advisor-network/articles/050416/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\"><em>6 Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Which of these profiles best describes you?</p>\n<h2>Preservers</h2>\n<p>Preservers are investors who place a great deal of emphasis on financial security and on preserving wealth rather than taking <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\">risks</a> to grow wealth. Preservers watch closely over their assets and are anxious about losses and short-term performance. Preservers also have trouble taking action for fear of making the wrong investments decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Preservers:</strong> An investment strategy should take into account short-, mid- and long-term goals. By overemphasizing short-term returns, an investor risks making an emotional decision based on the short-term performance, which may end up being more detrimental to them in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Accumulators</h2>\n<p>Accumulators are investors who are interested in accumulating wealth and are confident they can do so. Accumulators tend to want to steer the ship when it comes to making investment decisions. They are risk takers and typically believe that whatever path they choose is the correct one. Accumulators have frequently been successful in prior business endeavors and are confident that they will make successful investors as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Common issue with Accumulators:</strong> Overconfidence. We recently wrote a blog on the issue with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock picking</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">active management.</a> Overconfidence is a natural human tendency. As investors, accumulators consistently overestimate their ability to predict future returns. History has shown that it is impossible to predict markets at large scale, yet accumulators continue to try and do so and expose themselves to extreme risk.</p>\n<h2>Followers</h2>\n<p>Followers are investors who tend to follow the lead of their friends and colleagues, a general investing fad, or the status quo, rather than having their own ideas or making their own decisions about investing. Followers may lack interest and/or knowledge of the financial markets and their decision-making process may lack a long-term plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Followers:</strong> The herd mentality is a concept of investors piling into the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/diversification-gluten-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same investments as others</a>. This is often the basis of investment bubbles and subsequent crashes in the stock market. When you are a follower, you are typically following fund managers who have tools and recourses to act on new information in a fraction of a second. By the time the average investor “follows” them into a position, it is often too late. It is always important to understand your investment decisions and how they fit into your overall plan.</p>\n<h2>Independents</h2>\n<p>Independents are investors who have original ideas about investing and like to be involved in the investment process. Unlike followers, they are very interested in the process of investing, and are engaged in the financial markets. Many Independents are analytical and critical thinkers and trust themselves to make confident and informed decisions, but risk the pitfalls of only following their own research.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Issues with Independents:</strong> Similar to overconfidence bias associated with accumulators, independents face similar issues with relying too heavily on their own train of thought. We as humans have ability to convince ourselves that we are correct or that we don’t need guidance, even when that is not the case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

We caught up on wives, kids, work and all the other important parts of our lives. One thing struck me about the conversations, no matter whether I was speaking with liberal arts majors or those who studied corporate finance: While we all know that E=MC2 and maybe even know a fair amount about Einstein’s theory, most of them graduated without having a real clue about personal finance.</p>\n<p>In other words, the financial skills we learn in school are not necessarily the ones we need in the real world — at least when it comes to our personal lives.</p>\n<p>Personal finance is not typically part of a college curriculum. And while some of us have parents or family members who can guide us along the way, those individuals may not be financial experts, and there is a limit to the help they can provide.</p>\n<p>From my experience, most people are interested in financial literacy but don’t know where to go to get started. We all face similar issues, and the less familiar we are with the mechanics of approaching them, the more anxiety-provoking they become.</p>\n<p>The younger you learn, the better off you are. When I was in the first grade, I wanted to be Alex P. Keaton, the money-savvy teenager played by Michael J. Fox on the television sitcom “Family Ties.” It was clear early on that I had an affinity for sound saving, investing and growing money. When I was 7, my grandmother gave me a dollar; I turned it into $5, then $50. I am thrilled by the challenge of helping people reach their financial goals at all stages of their lives.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/do-interest-rates-have-you-worried-about-buying-a-first-home/\" rel=\"nofollow\">buying that first home</a>. Your career is on track, and becoming a homeowner seems like an appropriate goal. So with some excitement and anticipation, you decide to start looking.</p>\n<p>Then the questions begin flooding in. How much home can I afford? How much should I be saving? When is the ideal time to buy? How does a mortgage work? Will I qualify? What’s my credit score? Do I need insurance? How do property taxes work?</p>\n<p>Imagine if there were a course in college (let’s not get crazy and imagine they would teach this in high school) called Personal Finance 101. In addition to the homebuying lessons above, the curriculum could look something like this:</p>\n<h3>Cash flow and budgeting</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What is a budget? <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/160946766\" rel=\"nofollow\">How do I create one?</a> How do I know what I can afford?</p>\n<h3>Building credit and understanding credit cards</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What are the advantages and disadvantages of owning a credit card? How should I decide which one to get?</p>\n<h3>Intro to the stock market and investing</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> What are the differences in the various investment vehicles — exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit?</p>\n<h3>Taxes</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> How do I pay taxes? What do I need to pay attention to in my <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tax planning</a>?</p>\n<h3>Future workplace retirement plan options</h3>\n<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\">What is a 401(k),</a> IRA, Roth IRA? When should I start saving? How much should I save?</p>\n<p>My guess is that a course like this would be incredibly valuable to many. It’s complicated stuff. It’s important stuff. It’s the kind of stuff that you actually need to know.</p>\n<p>This is the main reason I chose to get in this line of work. Younger people have no idea where or how to start, and they have no idea where to find help. Traditional financial management institutions have investment minimums that most of us won’t be able to meet for over a decade, if ever. These minimums can range from $250,000 to $500,000, and sometimes are higher. Even if you were fortunate enough to be accepted by a big institutional investment manager, you’re kidding yourself if you think a large institution is going to take the time to explain to you the difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.</p>\n<p>That’s why I chose to create a wealth management model where we would provide the same customized service to all of our clients, without consideration of a minimum initial investment and irrespective of the size of their accounts. We hope that by investing in you early, you’ll see our value for the long term.</p>\n<p>If you are reading this and can relate to some of these thoughts, know that it’s not just you. It doesn’t matter whether you majored in art or corporate finance, you almost certainly did not take a class in Personal Finance 101. The good news is, you don’t have to go at it alone. Seek the help that is out there, and learn what you may have missed in college.</p>\n<p>This article was originally published on NerdWallet.com</p>\n<p><em>This article also appears on <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-personal-finance-classes-should-be-taught-in-college-cm610810\">Nasdaq</a>.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

A good financial advisor is there to prevent you from making decisions that would have a negative, unintended impact on you. Who wouldn’t love to have a financial coach to keep you on track to achieve your financial goals?</p>\n<p>Just like with any working relationship, it’s a good idea to interview advisors until you find the one who is the best fit for you, your life, and your financial goals. Since you are entrusting your financial well-being to someone, you should get to know them and their financial planning and<u> </u>investing philosophy before committing to a long-term relationship.</p>\n<p>As you may have heard the Department of Labor (DOL) has just released its new fiduciary rule in its final form. We previously wrote about the reasons why someone would <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\">oppose this rule</a> considering it was created to improve financial transparency and eliminate conflicted advice from advisors. While this rule would still allow advisors to keep their “conflicted” commissions in some instances, it would require advisors to act as fiduciaries (a.k.a. “best interests contract”) when handling client’s retirement accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/\">We have long been proponents</a> of more transparency and conflict-free advice and feel this is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>So how does this affect your search for the right financial advisor? Here are 6 questions to ask to help with finding a financial advisor.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Are You a Fiduciary? (Are You ALWAYS a Fiduciary?)<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, this new rule will only require financial advisors to act as a fiduciary for client’s <u>retirement accounts</u>. A fiduciary is regulated by federal law and must adhere to strict standards. They must act in the client’s best interest, in good faith, and they must provide full disclosure regarding fees, compensation, and any current or potential conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Until now, broker-dealers, insurance salesman, bank and financial company representatives, and others were only required to follow a Suitability Standard. That means they only had to provide recommendations that are “suitable” for a client – based on age or aversion to risk for example – but this may or may not be in that client’s best interest.</p>\n<p>The brokerage industry, as you can probably imagine, and all those who earn their compensation from commissions are strongly against these new rules.</p>\n<p>Even with this new law passed, we feel it is important to make sure your advisor is acting as a fiduciary when dealing with ANY of your finances, not just retirement accounts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2. What is Your Fee Structure? (Difference Between Fee-Only, Fee-Based and Commission)</strong></h3>\n<p>Advisors throw out terms like “fee-based” and consumers assume that is the same as<br />\n“fee-only.” That is not the case. At Sherman Wealth Management, we are fee-only which means that we are paid <u>exclusively</u> by our clients, so we are completely <strong>conflict-free</strong>. We do not get commissions from the investments or products we recommend. We do not get bonuses based on how many clients we get to invest in company products. We are paid an hourly or quarterly fee by our clients who retain us because we are making their money work for them with only their best interest in mind.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent your best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you.</p>\n<p>Do not assume that an advisor is following a fiduciary standard with their compensation now. The new rules will not be enforced until 2018. Ask your financial advisor to clearly specify their fees. With many layers of diversification that can be applied to your portfolio, you want to be aware of whether you are exposed to up-front charges, back-end fees, expense ratios, and/or whether a percentage of your returns will be deducted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Why Are They Right for YOU?</strong></h3>\n<p>A financial advisor should be able to tell you their strengths and what sets them apart. Some advisors will advise on investments while others specialize in comprehensive financial planning. While you may think all advisors are the same, and it certainly may seem like that on the surface, by now you should be seeing that is not the case.</p>\n<p>Ask how involved they are with their client’s portfolios. Are they hands-on in their approach? How available are they for their clients’ needs?</p>\n<p>For us, we enjoy serving a wide-range of clients, from young first-timers who are just getting started with investing and financial planning, to experienced savers, to high-net-worth investors who are well on their way to financial independence.</p>\n<p>We strive to understand our clients wants and needs. We help our clients plan for the long term while simultaneously working to avoid short-term roadblocks. We do so by making it a point to SHOW you that you are not alone. We’re just like you, we’ve been there, and we know that financial planning can be an anxiety provoking activity for many. We use a fluid process to help set clear, realistic goals with an easy to understand roadmap of what you need to do to get there. We are right there with you every step of the way.</p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s world you don’t just want a trusted advisor, you want instant access to your accounts and the progress you are making. That is why we offer some of the best in new financial services technology tools.</p>\n<p>[video_embed video=&#8221;160946766&#8243; parameters=&#8221;&#8221; mp4=&#8221;&#8221; ogv=&#8221;&#8221; placeholder=&#8221;&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8243; height=&#8221;281&#8243;]</p>\n<p>The relationship with your financial advisor is an important one. You need to feel comfortable with whom you are working with.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4. What is Your Investment Philosophy?</strong></h3>\n<p>Every financial advisor has a specific approach to planning and investing. Some advisors prefer trying to time the market and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\">actively manage funds versus passive investments.</a> Others may seek to gain high returns and make riskier investments. Your goals and risk tolerance need to align with the advisor’s philosophy.</p>\n<p>When anyone invests money, they are doing so with the hopes of growing it faster than inflation. While some traditional investment managers not only want to generate a profitable return, they aim to beat the market by taking advantage of pricing discrepancies and attempting to time the market and predict the future. Some investment companies offer “one-size-fits-all” investment management solutions that only take into account your age and income.</p>\n<p>We have a different approach. We believe an individuals best chance at building wealth through the capital markets is to avoid common <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-finance-instinctive-behaviors/\">behavioral biases</a> in the beginning and utilize a well thought out, disciplined, and long-term approach to investing. We create a well diversified, customized portfolio that focuses on tax efficiency, cost effectiveness, and risk management. Read more about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\">how we do this. </a></p>\n<p>Make it a top priority to understand the strategy your advisor uses and that you are comfortable with it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>5. How Personalized Are Your Recommendations for Your Clients? </strong></h3>\n<p>It is important that your financial advisor tailors your financial plan to your specific goals. Your retirement plan and investment strategy should be customized to take into account your risk tolerance, age, income, net-worth, and other factors specific to your situation. There should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to managing your money.</p>\n<p>Some traditional brokers and insurance companies are so big that it becomes impossible for them to give you a truly individualized experience. They have a corporate agenda that they must follow and it can restrict the service they provide to you.</p>\n<p>As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first-time investors, it has also inspired a new breed of smaller independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs), like Sherman Wealth Management. What our clients all have in common is that they appreciate the focus on their own individual goals and best interests that we guarantee as a boutique, independent, fee-only fiduciary.</p>\n<p>We know that each client is unique.  We don’t look for “market efficiencies” or work for sales commissions on the products we recommend. Our focus is different. We strive to help investors build a strong foundation and grow with them, not by profiting off good or bad trades. This gives us the opportunity to create individual strategies and plans that are uniquely suited to each client, not just a cookie-cutter plan based on age, income, or broadly assessed risk tolerance.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h3><strong>6. Do You Have Any Asset or Revenue Minimums?</strong></h3>\n<p>Some have argued that the proposed DOL rule will end up hurting the small investor because larger institutions will not be willing to serve small accounts. This logic is fundamentally backward and flawed, as those clients were never on their radar to begin with. In fact, the ability for these large institutions to generate commissions and thus charge more to these small investor clients have driven that business, without regard to the best interests of the individual investor.</p>\n<p>For example, In a company statement quoted by <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/12/18/wells-fargo-2016-comp-plan-pushes-fas-to-give-away\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Janet Levaux</a> in Think Advisor, Wells Fargo, the most valuable financial institution in the world according to the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-co-is-the-earths-most-valuable-bank-1437538216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall Street Journal</a>, said that in 2016, “bonuses will be awarded to FAs with 75% of their client households at $250,000.”</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo isn’t the only large institution effectively ignoring Millennials and other smaller and entry-level clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net-worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades.</p>\n<p>The complaints against the new DOL rule have nothing to do with protecting the little guy. Rather, the complaints are driven by the desire of commission-based large institutions, insurance companies, and broker-dealers who are trying to protect their ability to generate commissions and charge clients unnecessary fees.</p>\n<p>Make sure you understand your advisor’s motivations.

A fiduciary standard ensures that the advisor&#8217;s duty is to the client only, not the corporation they represent. To the surprise of many, that currently is not always the case. Financial advisors have had the ability to profit (through commissions and high fees) to the potential detriment of their clients. That is exactly what many large financial institutions and insurance companies have done. In fact, the federal government estimates that there are roughly <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/cea_coi_report_final.pdf\">$17 billion dollars</a> of fees generated each year from conflicted advice.</p>\n<p>The DOL has made clear &#8211;and we agree&#8211; that a commission based investment model creates a conflict of interest. Companies with a commission based model operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest. For example, an advisor may receive a 5% commission by selling you a fund through their company when you could get a similar product elsewhere without commission. Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent your best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you. That is the primary reason we stay completely independent and operate as conflict-free, fee-only advisors.</p>\n<p>The proposed DOL rule will hopefully begin to fix this issue as it is expected to require a strict fiduciary standard for financial advisors in the context of sales for retirement account products.  This standard will require advisors to certify that they are acting independently and in their client’s best interest, and are not motivated by the prospect of a commission. This has created a firestorm among big insurance companies, broker dealers and other institutional investors who, as we pointed out, don’t typically operate as fiduciaries.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/306476032/Elizabeth-Warren-letter-to-SEC?secret_password=aGGzGnDFye7HhhQe5m4V\">letter sent last week to the SEC</a>, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a strong proponent of the proposed DOL rule, pointed out that presidents of Transamerica, Lincoln National, Jackson National and Prudential all have called this proposal “unworkable.”  She commented on the self interest in their position, and the danger in permitting unwitting investors to be guided by non-fiduciaries in the context of their retirement investments.</p>\n<p>Why would a rule that requires a financial advisor to act in their client&#8217;s best interest create such an uproar? One reason is that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unlike Sherman Wealth Management</a>, they are in a commission driven model, and therefore fear that the way they currently serve clients would not meet the standards of this new rule. We hope that because of the conflict a commission driven model creates, that eventually enough pressure from policy-makers like Senator Warren and Labor Secretary Perez will propel this proposed new rule beyond just retirement accounts. In the meantime, think to yourself why anyone would oppose this rule if not for purely selfish reasons?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

A manager who outperformed last year may not do it again this year.</p>\n<h3><strong>Reasons for underperformance</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a few main reasons actively managed funds underperform, aside from picking the wrong investments:</p>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/mutual-fund-fees-what-investors-need-to-know/\">FEES</a></strong></h4>\n<p>Many actively managed funds charge 1% to 2% per year in management fees, while a passively managed exchange-traded fund could charge as little as 0.1% to 0.2% per year. And many actively managed mutual funds are <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/125.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loaded funds</a>, which means you’ll pay a sales charge, typically between 4% to 8% of your investment, when you buy or sell the fund — though the fee may decrease the longer you stay invested. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=active%20vs%20passive&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dollar%20cost%20averaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compounded over time</a>, these higher fees can eat up a lot of gain, reducing overall returns.</p>\n<h4><strong>TAXES</strong></h4>\n<p>Because actively managed funds try to time the market and pick winners, they buy and sell positions frequently. These transaction costs reduce the fund’s returns, and all the buying and selling can also create taxable gain. Fund managers have no incentive to avoid this because they simply pass those taxable gains on to you, the shareholder.</p>\n<h4><strong>MARKET EFFICIENCY</strong></h4>\n<p>Some argue that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13stra.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">markets are becoming more efficient</a>, making it difficult to identify overvalued or undervalued stocks. The efficient market hypothesis states that stocks are constantly adjusting to news and information, and thus their share prices reflect their “fair value.” In simpler language, other than in the very short term, there are no undervalued stocks to buy or inflated stocks to sell. This makes it virtually impossible to outperform the market through individual stock selection and market timing.</p>\n<h3><strong>An unsustainable approach</strong></h3>\n<p>Whether active management can outperform is a controversial topic. Many experts dismiss the science and say that they can indeed beat the market. Some of them may even do so for a year or two, or even five, but what about over the long run? It’s simply not sustainable, and to think otherwise is dangerous.</p>\n<p>If the data shows that the vast majority of the brightest and most well-equipped professional investors can’t beat their benchmarks, why should you believe anyone who says they can?</p>\n<p><em>This story also appears on <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/dont-expect-to-win-with-actively-managed-funds-cm597983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nasdaq</a>.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You’d be better off gambling with <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/powerball-ticket/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Power%20Ball\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the lottery</a> based on those odds.</p>\n<p>However, straying from the standard “favorites” isn’t always the answer either. People love to pick the underdog or “dark horse,” but if you do this consistently year after year, you aren’t likely to have much success. <strong>That doesn’t mean you can’t pick an underdog here or there, but the <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Stock%20Picking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risky picks</a> should be a subset of your overall picks, not the full strategy. </strong></p>\n<p>The truth is, no one wins a bracket pool by picking all favorites or all upsets. As the point above taught us, everyone is just guessing. By diversifying your picks with some favorites and some upsets, you give yourself the best chance at success.</p>\n<p>The same principal applies with investing. If your portfolio is composed of stocks from one sector or all growth stocks, you are exposing yourself to huge amounts of risk. Sure, the reward may be great if you end up being right, but as we’ve seen time and time again, that is a strategy that can set you up for disaster.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

But there’s a problem with this method of investing. Like gambling in Vegas, it may be fun and even rewarding in the short term. Yet in the end, just as the house always wins, picking stocks is a losing game.</p>\n<p>I talk to friends all the time who say they invest in stocks — meaning individual ones rather than broad-based index funds that capture the movement of the entire market — and I always wonder why. I think many people see a company that carries a well-known name — maybe they are customers or they hear about it on the news — and they assume it’s a good investment. But history has shown us time and time again that picking stocks of individual companies, and thus trying to determine which will be the winners, is not a good investment strategy.</p>\n<p>No company is immune to short- or long-term failure, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-valeant-dilemma-how-diversified-is-your-diversification/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=stock%20picking&amp;utm_campaign=valeant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no matter how good they look in the moment</a>. The company’s value may not go to zero, but it could certainly take a huge hit relative to its underlying industry or index. Just think about <a href=\"http://snip.ly/4evwv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index has changed</a> in the past two decades. There has been a revolving door among the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500, proving that even the biggest companies out there are not immune to <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/why-volatility-is-an-opportunity-for-long-term-growth/\">volatility</a> and risk.</p>\n<h3>Individual stocks vs. an index</h3>\n<p>As further evidence that picking stocks is risky and ultimately a losing game, consider recent research from financial firm <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/Eye_on_the_Market_September_2014_-_Executive_Summary.pdf?blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1320684901654&amp;blobheader=application/pdf&amp;blobheadername1=Cache-Control&amp;blobheadervalue1=private&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</a> It compared the Russell 3000 index — which, as the company notes, “represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market” — between 1980 and 2014 with information on individual stocks. Here are the three main findings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The risk of ‘catastrophic’ failure </strong><strong>among individual stocks is </strong><strong>higher than you think. </strong>“When looking at how often a stock has what we call a ‘catastrophic decline’ — falling 70% or more and never recovering — we see that 40% of all stocks suffer this fate at some time in their history. And some sectors — like telecom, biotech and energy — saw higher-than-average loss rates,” the report states.</li>\n<li><strong>Most stocks underperform over their lifetime.</strong> According to the report, “The data shows that two-thirds of all individual stocks underperform over their ‘lifetime,’ as compared to the Russell 3000. On average, the outcome for individual stocks was underperformance of about 50%.”</li>\n<li><strong>Concentrated holdings in individual stocks add huge amounts of risk to your portfolio.</strong> “When computing the optimal risk-adjusted return for a concentrated holder,” the report notes, “we find that 75% of concentrated stockholders would benefit from some degree of diversification.”</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why investors keep picking stocks</h3>\n<p>So why do so many individuals keep trying to pick stocks? I see two main reasons.</p>\n<p>We all enjoy making money, and we don’t usually associate the word “boring” with something we enjoy. That reason alone likely explains why so many people try to pick stocks. It’s the “sexy” way to invest. But the research is clear that this is not an optimal strategy. When it comes to investing, “sexy” might as well be spelled “sucker.”</p>\n<p>Rather, investing should be boring. It’s like baseball: Base hits are the name of the game. By properly diversifying your investment portfolio — picking a mix of asset classes with exposure to many sectors and countries — with a long-term strategy, you allow yourself to take advantage of compounded gains without subjecting yourself to unnecessary risk (i.e., swinging for the fences).</p>\n<p>The other major issue is that not all investors understand what they are doing. When you’re stock-picking, you may think that you are diversified by owning five different stocks; but if that’s all you own, you’re exposing yourself to a huge amount of risk by having such a large percentage of your portfolio invested in just one stock or industry. One catastrophic loss could devastate your portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Diversification</h3>\n<p>The logical question you might have is, <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=stock%20picking&amp;utm_campaign=Most%20Important%20Question%20to%20Ask%20Financial%20Advisor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“OK, so what should I do?” </a>While answers are going to vary slightly for each individual, one applies across the board: Diversify. That doesn’t mean owning many different individual stocks in the same sector, but rather spreading your investments throughout multiple asset classes, industries and countries. Proper diversification of your portfolio is key to your investing success over the long run.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Now reality has set in.</p>\n<p>As with all market corrections, this one has inspired retail investors to question whether it’s time to pull money out, shift to safer and more stable investments or just throw in the towel entirely.</p>\n<p>While it is normal to feel anxiety during a downturn, there’s another way to look at it. As long as downturns and dips don’t affect your financial plan or, more specifically, your immediate need for cash, they can be an opportunity.</p>\n<p>Remember the mantra “buy low and sell high”? The volatility, geopolitical risk and uncertainty we’ve experienced so far in 2016 have presented a particular opportunity for investors in the accumulation stage of their lives, or for anyone who has money but hasn’t started investing yet, to actually buy low (or at least lower). If you’ve been delaying investing regularly because the “market was too high” or “you knew a correction was coming,” now might be a good time to start.</p>\n<p>The key is to view volatility — like what we experienced last August and what we are seeing now — as a tool to keep contributing regularly to your investments. This will let you maximize the possible potential for your investments and enable you to watch them grow. The two best concepts to help you do that are dollar-cost averaging and compounded interest.</p>\n<h3>Dollar-cost averaging</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/dollar-cost-averaging/\">Dollar-cost averaging</a> is the process of spreading out the costs of your investments as the market rises and falls, rather than purchasing shares all at one (potentially higher) price. The key is to pick a schedule — whether it’s monthly, bimonthly or weekly — and an amount, no matter how small, and stick to it by purchasing as many additional shares in your investments as your fixed amount will allow. This is much more effective than trying to “time” the market by buying shares when they are at their lowest or selling when they are at their highest.</p>\n<p>Using this system, you are regularly contributing the same amount, regardless of the price of shares. As a result, that fixed dollar amount buys more shares in times when the market has dropped and prices are low, and it limits the amount of shares when the market has risen and prices are high. Over time you will come out ahead, compared with trying to time the market.</p>\n<h3>Compound interest</h3>\n<p>Once you have started to build up the size of your investment with the help of dollar-cost averaging, the concept of <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/compound-interest-save-early/\">compound interest</a> gives you a boost. Compounded interest is the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment already has earned. If you have $1,000, for instance, and it earns 5% interest yearly, you will earn $50 at the end of the first year. Then, if you keep that money invested, the next year you will earn 5% interest on the total — $1,050 — which is $52.50. The following year, you will earn 5% on $1,102.50, which is a little more than $55.</p>\n<p>Because dips in prices allow you to buy more shares with a fixed amount, volatility allows you to maximize the potential for compound interest as well.</p>\n<p>Using these two concepts, the daily ups and downs and market corrections are not a cause for undue concern. If you are sticking to your dollar-cost averaging plan and taking advantage of compound interest, news events shouldn’t affect your long-term plans and goals. Any dollar that is invested in the stock market should be a dollar that you are comfortable keeping invested through a bear market or a major correction.</p>\n<p>If you are disciplined about investing, and consistent about reinvesting, you’ll start to look at market volatility as a tool and an opportunity, rather than as a source of anxiety or, worse, a reason to throw in the towel and lose out on long-term growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Economics is hard. Not in a &#8220;things are actually good today&#8221; way. But in mid-2008 surging oil prices and a falling dollar were a big headwind.”</p>\n<p>As a Financial Advisor, I read every piece of economic data available to me and follow the thought processes of the top thinkers at virtually all the key financial institutions so I can carefully invest money on behalf of our clients.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I’ve discovered: none of them, and none of us, have been given a roadmap to what the future holds. They can watch and study the relevant economic indicators, but they cannot predict the financial future with absolute certainty. We all live with uncertainty while trying to make the best decisions we can with the information available.</p>\n<p>Given the certainty of uncertainty, what can individuals do to best prepare for their financial future?</p>\n<p>With all of the speculation about the upcoming elections, questions about possible negative interest rates, and concerns about international instability, it’s easy to feel anxious about the potential effects on the economy and on your savings and investments. Particularly because the airwaves and the Internet are full of news reports, commentary, blogposts and Tweets about how volatile and risky the markets are.</p>\n<p>One thing that <em>is</em> certain: there will always be volatility and risk in the markets. That’s what makes the stock market the stock market. Even if we are currently experiencing a bit more than just normal market volatility, remember that the markets have historically rebounded extremely well after corrections (which are considered a drop of at least 10%). Don’t take my word for it, take a look at the chart below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2927\"><img class=\"wp-image-2927\" style=\"float: left; padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 10%; width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1-300x181.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.10 AM\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1-300x181.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1-1024x619.png 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1-768x464.png 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.10-AM-1.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.28-AM-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2926\"><img class=\" wp-image-2926\" style=\"padding-right: 4%; width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.28-AM-300x182.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.28 AM\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2925\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2925 aligncenter\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 40%;\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1-300x183.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 9.12.44 AM\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1-300x183.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1-1024x623.png 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1-768x467.png 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-9.12.44-AM-1.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>These charts show 27 corrections of at least 10% or more since 1987. All of those corrections had one thing in common: they all rebounded with a bullish rally. What history has shown is that, over the long run, markets continue to move higher.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for individual savers and investors? No matter your age or experience with financial planning and investments, there is one universal “must” that applies to everyone. You need a financial plan:  a carefully thought-out, customized financial plan, not just something you downloaded from Google. Once you have that plan in place, the next steps are to implement it, then put your head down and trust in that plan.</p>\n<p>This current market in particular highlights the importance of having a financial plan that is both age-appropriate and risk-adjusted to your specific financial situation, goals, and needs. If you&#8217;re in your 20s or 30s, for instance, the correction we’re experiencing is a great opportunity. Why? Because you have the luxury of time on your side. With the market currently down significantly from where it was a year ago, this is a great time to implement a <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=fed&amp;utm_campaign=dollar%20cost%20averaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dollar cost averaging</a> strategy and start saving and investing on a consistent basis.</p>\n<p>One of the things that <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=fed&amp;utm_campaign=red%20pill%20or%20blue%20pill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">differentiates us at Sherman Wealth</a>, however, is that we believe that no two people are alike and that everyone’s investment strategy and portfolio should be customized to suit his or her individual situation, needs, and goals. We get to know each client – or potential client &#8211; so we can analyze their actual risk tolerance in a holistic way, rather than just plugging their age and one or two other factors into a simple, one-size-fits all algorithm the way some of the Robo-Advisor platforms do. Then we create a plan that is designed to work for our clients.</p>\n<p>I can’t tell you what the market is going to do tomorrow or six months from now – no one can. But with a well-thought-out financial plan &#8211; one that takes into consideration who you are now, where you want to be, and how much risk you can tolerate &#8211; you will feel much more confident about your own strategy and less likely to panic about what the next crazy pundit to pop up on the internet has to say.</p>\n<h6>Photo Source: AP</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

If you&#8217;re gluten-free, that means having a pantry already stocked with gluten-free pasta and a gluten-free loaf of bread in the freezer &#8211; not to mention beans, rice and tomato sauce &#8211; to tide you through the blizzard. It also means sticking to what you know has made sense for you in the past and realizing that two days without bread is not the end of the world &#8211; the bread will return to the shelves once the storm has passed.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if you know your risk tolerance and have already planned effectively, you&#8217;ll have a balanced portfolio that contains the right balance of stocks and other less volatile instruments <em>before</em> a storm hits. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-valeant-dilemma-how-diversified-is-your-diversification/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=gluten-free%20blog&amp;utm_campaign=diversification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">With a fully diversified asset allocation strategy,</a> there will be parts of your portfolio that go up, as well as other parts that go down, during times of stress. That way you&#8217;ll be comfortable sticking to your investment strategy and plan when the market is stormy. Plus, you&#8217;ll have purchased those less volatile instruments before pundits start shouting and everyone starts panic-purchasing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=gluten-free%20blog&amp;utm_campaign=red%20pill%20or%20blue%20pill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A good financial advisor will help you build a portfolio strategy</a> that truly for reflects your risk tolerance and, importantly, helps you understand <em>exactly where the risk is </em>in your portfolio. Your advisor will help you understand if, when and <em>why</em> to own bonds, Munis, Treasuries, and CDs, and how much of a cash component makes sense for your particular situation and need for liquidity.<strong><br />\n</strong><br />\nThe volatility we’re experiencing, current geopolitical uncertainty (like Japanese negative interest rates), and Federal Reserve uncertainty are all great litmus tests to determine whether you have a properly diversified portfolio and whether or not it&#8217;s an accurate match for your true risk tolerance.  If current market conditions or any paper losses you may be experiencing make you feel uncomfortable &#8211; or keeps you up at night &#8211; it&#8217;s likely that your investment strategy does <em>not</em> match your actual risk tolerance and needs to be re-balanced.</p>\n<p>If, however, you&#8217;ve worked with your financial advisor and are comfortable with where you, then you’re best bet is probably to ignore the noise, ignore the panicking pundits, and stick to your saving and investing plan. Remember, if your investments made sense to you a couple of weeks ago, they probably continue to make sense for you, even during market volatility.</p>\n<p>Just like a diversified pantry will help you stick to your nutritional goals when there&#8217;s a run on the supermarket, a good fee-only financial advisor can help you create a portfolio that is truly diversified, risk appropriate, and with the exact amount of liquidity that makes sense for your long-term goals, so you can sit back and weather the storm with confidence.</p>\n<h6>Photo Source: Reuters/Shannon Stapleton</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Are you wondering – given the rate increase and current market turmoil – if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now?</p>\n<p>Actually, the exact opposite happened. Rates actually fell from 2.3% to 1.55% on the US 10-year treasuries (a common indicator of how mortgage rates are priced), their lowest point since September 2012. If you already own a home with an ARM or 30-year fixed mortgage, this is also a good time to refinance or reduce debt at these low rates.</p>\n<p>Remember a house or condo is both a home <u>and</u> an asset that can appreciate over time. No matter what they’re saying on the news, what’s important is what makes sense for <em>your</em> finances, based on <em>your</em> goals and what’s happening in your local housing market.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things to consider:</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate your current circumstances: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would your mortgage payment be in relation to current rent? A good rent-versus-buy calculator can be found at <strong><a href=\"http://realtor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Realtor.com</a></strong></li>\n<li>Do you plan to be in the area for 5 years or more? The housing market will fluctuate. If you need to sell quickly, you may have to sell for less than desired, whereas a booming market can provide quick sales for a profit.</li>\n<li>Can you afford the additional costs? The cost of home ownership is more than just the mortgage payment. There are taxes, insurance and sometimes homeowner’s dues that need to be considered, not to mention upkeep, repairs, upgrades, and furniture!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assess Your Finances:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a good understanding of what your assets and liabilities are.</li>\n<li>Consider what you can afford. Being house poor and unable to save for emergencies, retirement, college or other financial goals can create a stressful situation.</li>\n<li>Speak with a lender about which programs you may qualify for; what a lender will approve you for and how much you can afford may not be the same thing.</li>\n<li>Take a look at your credit report. <strong><a href=\"http://Annualcreditreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a></strong> offers a free credit report from all three credit bureaus. Get one from each bureau and check it for accuracy.</li>\n<li>Meet with a financial advisor to strategize your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\"><strong>financial planning</strong></a> Is it better to make a higher down payment, pay down debt to get your debt to income ratios lower? Or is it better to leave the money invested so the lender includes this in your financial reserves?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Get Pre-approval:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your chosen lender will review your financial information and credit, then make an assessment about how much home you can buy, what down payment is required, and the best loan program. The lender then provides a preapproval letter.</li>\n<li>A second option is having an underwriter review your completed file, evaluating your income, credit, and financial assets, then providing a pre-approval letter.   Having an underwriter review your file may require application fees and other costs to be paid up front.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contact a real estate agent:</strong></p>\n<p>Start your search online to help narrow down location and potential neighborhoods. This can save time (and therefore money) by giving you a sense of where you want to live and what is available in your price range.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay attention above all to location: be sure you are within an acceptable commute to work, schools and other activities that you will be involved in on a regular basis.</li>\n<li>Consider resale value: do not buy the most expensive home in the neighborhood.</li>\n<li>Consider how you want to use your financial resources: fixer-uppers are the best bargains but take both cash and time to complete.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Buying a home is an exciting decision and can result in a solid investment that appreciates over time. Whether or not this is the right moment to purchase is something you should evaluate carefully with your financial advisor, based on your current financial plan and your long-term goals, not based on the news or economic “predictions.”</p>\n<p>While interest rates may have risen slightly they are still at historic lows, so don’t miss out the opportunities that a low-interest rate environment offers homeowners and prospective homeowners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

You may have to postpone that fantasy of buying a private island in Thailand, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still be on your way to achieving your financial goals and dreams.</p>\n<p>Here’s one way to do it – take that money you&#8217;re sinking into lottery tickets and invest it instead.</p>\n<p>Why are so many people willing to waste hundreds of dollars on a lottery they won&#8217;t win instead of investing it in capital markets that have shown growth over time? Many reasons. For some people, the hardest part of saving and investing could be just getting started. For others, it&#8217;s not understanding the benefits of compound interest and that even small amounts add up over time. For others it may be fear of volatility and distrust or the markets from listening to too much CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg!</p>\n<p>While it’s true that markets have dipped significantly in January, market dips are a potential opportunity to buy low and earn higher returns over time. The bottom line is that, for most people, even those starting with modest amounts, keeping money in cash is generally <a href=\"http://cramersshirt.weebly.com/blog/cash-is-king-in-your-401k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not a winning proposition</a>.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p>Lets say you are contributing $250 each month ($3k/yr) to your 401k plan with a 100% company match and invest it in a diversified basket of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. At the same time, you save and invest $20 a week (the cost of 10 Powerball tickets a week) in a regular investment account. Assuming historical 4.8% annual returns*, here is how your money will grow over a 20-year period (in today’s dollars) vs. saving the same amount as cash:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2775 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1.png\" alt=\"Picture1\" width=\"853\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1.png 853w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1-300x180.png 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1-1-768x460.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" /></a></p>\n<h6>*based on a diversified portfolio that assumes the following weights: 25% in the S&amp;P 500, 10% in the Russell 2000, 15% in the MSCI EAFE, 5% in the MSCI EME, 25% in the Barclays Aggregate, 5% in the Barclays 1-3m Treasury, 5% in the Barclays Global High Yield Index, 5% in the Bloomberg Commodity Index and 5% in the NA REIT Equity REIT Index.

In December it was Wells Fargo doing the “ghosting.” By urging its brokers to get rid of clients with a minimum balance of less than 65,000, Wells Fargo Advisors sent a clear message to younger investors that, going forward, their money is “no good” at Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>In a company statement quoted by <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/author/janet-levaux\">Janet Levaux</a> in Think Advisor, Wells Fargo, which is the most valuable financial institution in the world according to the WSJ,* said that, in 2016, “bonuses will be awarded to FAs with 75% of their client households at $250,000.”</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo isn’t the only large institution effectively ignoring Millennials and other smaller and entry-level clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates “efficiencies of scale” and a higher profit margin on larger trades.</p>\n<p>As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first time investors, it has also inspired a new breed of smaller independent RIAs, like Sherman Wealth Management (“SWM”), as well as the the new &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221; firms.</p>\n<p>Younger, breakaway firms like SWM aren’t looking for “efficiencies” or working for sales commissions on the products we recommend. Our focus is different. We strive to help investors build a strong foundation then grow <em>with</em> them, not by profiting off the trades, good or bad, we recommend for them.</p>\n<p>Where large brokerages currently see a “revenue problem,” we see a growth potential and are building long-term lasting relationships. By the time Wells Fargo and the other firms with traditional models get around to investing their time and attention in younger investors, it may just be too late. Those Millennial clients will be growing their wealth with firms that didn’t “ghost” them and, like Jack – spoiler alert! – may end up being “frozen out” of the largest wealth transfer in the history of the world as capital shifts from Boomers to Millennials.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Have you looked into 529 plans?</p>\n<p>As a Financial Advisor, I would advise that you not waste that $2 when it would be better spent collecting compound interest. I would ask you whether you’d already contributed to your 401K plan, your emergency fund, and your other long or short term savings goals. Then I would suggest that if you really wanted to play Powerball, that you re-allocate that $2 from another area –  skipping the caramel latte this morning, for instance, or biking to work tomorrow to save on gas – so that the $2 is amortized.</p>\n<p>But I would also tell you to keep dreaming, because those things you are dreaming about are a great way to evaluate whether your current savings and investment goals are tailor-made to help you achieve the life you really want, the life you’d lead if there was nothing standing in your way.</p>\n<p>So consider it: if you won $90 million dollars, what’s the first thing you’d do?

No matter how careful you’ve been all year, it’s tempting to splurge on some of the things that make us happiest: good times with friends and family, travel, entertaining, and generous gift-giving to friends, loved ones, and favorite charities.</p>\n<p>Here are 9 end of year tips to help make sure you’re still on target with budget and strategy and help keep important goals in mind if you’re tempted to go over budget during the holidays.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review your budget:</strong> See where you can scrimp a little so you have more to spend on holiday fun. Bring lunch to work, skip bottled water or sodas, or take public transportation, for instance and use the money for holiday treats, travel, or gifting. Seeing where you can cut spending may give you some ideas about how to live more frugally in 2016 so you can pay down debt faster or increase your savings significantly.</li>\n<li><strong>Max out your 401K:</strong> Before the end of the year, take full advantage of your company’s matching program. Those matching funds are the gift that keeps giving through the power of compound interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Use your Flexible Spending Account:</strong> If you have a flex account for healthcare, transportation, or dependent care, try to use your yearly allowance before the end of the year. Cash in on that new pair of glasses you’ve been wanting. If you didn’t use it all – or if you’d already spent it all by May – rethink what you should set aside next year.</li>\n<li><strong>Take a look at this year’s tax refund:</strong> Decide if it makes sense to <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\">reduce how much is withheld</a> from each paycheck. By reducing your withholding you’ll have more money in 2016 for investments, savings, and next year’s holiday spending, instead of lending it, interest-free, to Uncle Sam.</li>\n<li><strong>Talk to your financial advisor:</strong> Whether having a conversation about converting from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA or what to declare next year on your taxes, the end of the year is the right time to make new financial decisions. Your <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/top-10-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\">financial advisor</a> can also help you determine if you have assets that are either above or below your target allocation. If you’re selling at a loss, you can take advantage of a tax write-off!</li>\n<li><strong>Review your insurance policies:</strong> Review any changes in your circumstance or property to make sure you have the right amount of coverage for all contingencies. At the same time, make sure you’re not over-paying for coverage you no longer need.</li>\n<li><strong>Give to your family:</strong> You can give up to $14,000 each to family members with no gift tax or reporting requirements, and the recipient doesn’t pay any tax either.</li>\n<li><strong>Give to charity:</strong> Before the end of the year, charitable donations are not only a great way to express your values, they are also a good way to increase your itemized deductions.</li>\n<li><strong>Save for the kids:</strong> Consider giving children or grandchildren an investment in their future and a first lesson in investing by contributing money to a 529 College Saving Plan! They can use the extra dollars tax-free for college tuition, room and board, and you get a state income tax deduction for your contribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it’s better to give than receive, don’t leave any free money or tax advantages on the table! Review your budget and see if you can add a line item for next year’s holidays so that December 2016 will be the happiest and most stress-free holiday season ever.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>***<br />\n</em></p>\n<h6>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

Make a Bigger Dent in your Debt</strong></p>\n<p>Are you feeling the weight of college loans, a mortgage, or, even worse, high interest credit card debt? You can lighten that load by using your bonus to make a larger payment than usual. It lowers your balance so it reduces some of those high interest charges moving forward. Increasing this budget category when you get that raise can also add up to a significant reduction of interest in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Invest to Watch it Grow</strong></p>\n<p>Setting aside money when you have large expenses to deal with <em>now</em> can be daunting. But the earlier you start investing the more time your money has to grow. If you haven’t already, create an investment account and put that bonus money to work for you, instead of leaving it in a checking account.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Kickstart Retiring</strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve kicked your tires and they need to be replaced, by all means, safety first! Use some of the rest of the money, though, to max out your company’s 401(k) contribution limits. If you qualify for an employer match, your bonus just got bigger!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Recalibrate Your Portfolios</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re already an investor, consider adding some of those extra funds to your investment portfolios. While you’re at it, take a look and see what’s working and what’s not.<strong> </strong>Your financial advisor can help you evaluate whether your allocations should be adjusted based on your risk tolerance and your long and short-term financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Start a College Savings Plan </strong></p>\n<p>It’s never too early to start saving for a child’s college education. By starting early, you can get a good head start and maximize compounded interest. Your financial advisor can help you choose a plan that works with your life, you goals your timeline, and, most importantly, your bonus!</p>\n<p><strong>7. Save for a Rainy Day</strong></p>\n<p>Those emergency funds may seem like low priority, until you suddenly need them. If you haven’t already, create an account with funds for unexepected expenses like job loss, emergency repairs, medical bills for you, your family, or your pets, and even weather emergencies (remember Hurricane Sandy?) A good rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses saved up just in case.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with treating yourself a little. You worked hard and you deserve it! Remember though, that by keeping the splurging and celebrating to a minimum, and letting that bonus or raise work for you, chances are you’ll have much more to celebrate when next year’s bonus comes around!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog post are as of the date of the posting, and are subject to change based on market and other conditions.

But they weren’t alone. Many well-respected funds, including the mighty <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/valeant-holder-sequoia-fund-sees-98-9-million-in-outflows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequoia Fund</a>, and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman&#8217;s <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/25/valeant-bill-ackman-hedge-funds-losses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pershing Capital</a> also had extensive exposure to long time Wall Street darling Valeant and suffered losses not only of value – but of face as well.</p>\n<p>The dramatic losses came as quite a shock to many of the investors who own these &#8211; and other affected &#8211; funds, and <strong>who assumed that the funds were diversified</strong> – when in fact they weren’t. By going out on a limb and investing too much of their allocation in what has been one of Wall Street’s hottest stocks for years, many respected “hedge” funds experienced huge capital losses that it will take years to recover from.</p>\n<p>In fact, of the 1,000 hedge funds tracked by Symmetric.IO, approximately 12% had a position in Valeant. A startling 32% of Valeant’s shares were held by hedge funds.</p>\n<p><strong>When Diversification isn’t Diversification</strong></p>\n<p>Having 20% of your portfolio in one stock is a huge risk for anyone. You never know when the next Enron or Worldcom may be and, because of accusations of unorthodox practices, it may very well be Valeant.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Valeant could still turn out to be a home run and deliver big time. No one really knows, which is why diversification is so key.</p>\n<p>Many investors diversify with ETFs and mutual funds. But how many investors are absolutely certain that the mutual funds they are counting on to provide diversification, are, in fact, properly diversified themselves?</p>\n<p><strong>When that Hot Stock is Too Much of a Good Thing<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>When a “hot stock” or fund keeps climbing, it’s tempting to want to jump on the bandwagon, and the same is true for a hot sector. That’s no doubt why so many otherwise experienced fund managers over-exposed themselves to Valeant and to the health sector in general.</p>\n<p>But while a portfolio with correlated assets that tend to do well together, is also a portfolio with assets that can tend to do poorly together when the winds shift. As Ben Carlson put it in a recent <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/how-much-diversification-is-necessary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a>: “Diversification requires finding the right balance between eliminating unsystematic risk (risk that’s specific to single securities or industries) and di-worsification by adding too many overlapping funds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Put another way: it’s not enough to put your eggs in different baskets, the eggs themselves need to be diversified, some plain, some speckled, and the speckled ones should be speckled in different ways.</p>\n<p>A properly diversified mutual fund or ETF allow you to invest in a sector or a “hot stock” while mitigating risk. Which is no doubt what the investors who held Tiger, Pershing, and Sequoia thought they were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>The Moral of the Story</strong></p>\n<p>Due diligence. While you and your financial advisor are most likely diversifying your holdings, make sure that your holdings are also diversifying <u>their</u> holdings. Review your mutual funds frequently to make sure that their strategies, risk tolerance, and diversification standards align with yours and that they are not over-weighted chasing impressive returns from a couple of current wall street darlings.</p>\n<p>The jury is still out on Valeant and on the funds that held it. It may in fact recover, although it would have to recover quickly to make up for the loss of momentum for the funds and investors that held it.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’s an important lesson for individual investors. A truly diversified portfolio is made up of truly diversified assets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">****</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This analysis is provided for informational purposes only and is not to be considered investment advice.

The Matrix?</p>\n<p>And does <strong>Financial Advisor</strong> conjure up a swaggering DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street? Or maybe someone in a Brooks Brothers suit, describing products you barely understand?</p>\n<p>If you said yes to either, you’re not alone.</p>\n<p>One common fear about the new wave of robo advisors is that, once you take the “red pill” and dive in, you’re no longer in control. You’ve turned your money over to a mysterious series of algorithms with no human in sight to help you guide it.</p>\n<p>Many investors – particularly younger ones – are also put off by the idea of bespoke-suited advisors from traditional firms who are trying to up-sell them investments and insurance products with hefty fees and commissions. And even if they were to opt for the more conservative “blue pill,” traditional advisories are often not interested in speaking with them because they can’t make the hefty minimum investment.</p>\n<p>While there is some truth to both stereotypes, there are also<strong> big shifts</strong> going on in the financial industry that make this a great time to take advantage of both a new breed of independent financial advisor and the efficiencies that targeted robo-platforms can provide.</p>\n<p>Here are the differences – as well as drawbacks and benefits &#8211; in a nutshell:</p>\n<p><strong>Robo Advisors:</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive compared to full-service portfolio management</li>\n<li>Lower barrier to entry: lower initial investment requirements</li>\n<li>Democratic: all clients benefit equally from algorithmic decisions, not just the big investors</li>\n<li>Data-driven: driven by numbers, trends, and deep data – not emotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited scope: robo advisor only handle investment management, not comprehensive financial planning</li>\n<li>Generic: they categorize you using broad-stroke demographic – not individualized- goal and risk-tolerance profiling to build your portfolio</li>\n<li>Automatic: selling or “rebalancing” can be triggered by pre-set formulas at times that you might be wiser to stay put</li>\n<li>Limited opportunities: many robo-firms currently have a limited or “preferred” set of funds and options you can invest in</li>\n<li>Impersonal: no human interaction for questions regarding your individual investment portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Traditional Financial Advisory Firms</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone who picks up the phone when you call or will see you when you make an appointment.</li>\n<li>Flexible: can make real-time decisions about what’s right for you or when to buy or sell not rather than being locked into formulas.</li>\n<li>Multi-layers of expertise to call on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier to entry: many traditional advisories have high minimums and confusing requirements and may only offer enhanced services to “premium” clients</li>\n<li>Conflict of interest: many advisories have a “corporate agenda” to promote certain products, or they follow a [Suitability Standard] that doesn’t necessarily put the clients’ interests above their own</li>\n<li>Change resistant: larger organizations can be “too big for their own good,” and slow to incorporate new tech or new processes that add value for their clients or address clients’ individual needs.</li>\n<li>Limited customization: established firms frequently use old-school models of demographics, risk allocation, and target dates without factoring in what makes each client unique</li>\n<li>Impersonal: while customer service is available, traditional firms often don’t truly “meet you where you are” and customize services and portfolios for you unless you have a large portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Enter the New Breed</strong></p>\n<p>A growing number of independent financial advisors are disrupting the traditional model and starting to create a “third way,” <strong>hybrid advisories</strong> that strive to offer all the pros and – hopefully &#8211; none of the cons. They offer clients customized fee-only services – unhindered by corporate agendas &#8211; and with a lower minimum investment. At the same time they are able to incorporate the newest tech tools that not only make it easy for new clients to get started, but also offer fast, best-in-class investment management modeling to make faster decisions about managing investments.</p>\n<p>Or, as Josh Brown so eloquently put it in <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2015/10/18/the-ballad-of-the-breakaway-broker/\">a recent blog post</a>, “…innovation and creative spirit is fleeing from the Old World to the new one.”</p>\n<p>So why haven’t all advisors embraced the new technology to offer enhanced services to their clients? The three biggest reasons are inertia, inertia, and inertia. It’s not easy to change entrenched business models, culture, and processes. Remember how Netflix caught the video rental business napping?</p>\n<p><strong>Why Not Just Go with a Robo Advisor?</strong></p>\n<p>Robo advisors generally only offer investment management, not comprehensive, goal-oriented financial planning. While both investment advisors and robo advisors can recommend investment direction, strategy, and allocation, a good financial advisor can help you identify goals, customize budgets and cash flow planning, and help you with insurance, credit, and debt management, things a robo-platform can’t do.</p>\n<p>The most important thing about the integration of new tech with personal attention and a customized plan is that a user-friendly tech interface can allow clients to manage all the pieces of their financial plans, from cash flow to 401Ks, while allowing an experienced advisor to monitor it and give clients a call when that advisor sees an opportunity, a red flag, or wants to check in about goals and direction.</p>\n<p>These days, clients can see through the bespoke suits; what they’re looking for is bespoke service. By embracing selected and appropriate technology, this new breed of independent financial advisors are able to offer all the “pros,” while creating a new model of more transparent, conflict-free financial management that’s available to everyone who wants to set – an achieve – financial goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/da113/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/3f132/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/8850c/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/da113/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/7223d/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/f2cbb/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/7369ed778d3ff8650593127fd09831ea/e9634/Robo-Advisors3-1.jpg 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"703037a2-0b3f-57b5-bc03-5866b40dd33e","slug":"the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor","title":"The Most Important Question You’ll Ever Ask Your Financial Advisor","content":"<p>Does your financial advisor follow the <strong>Fiduciary Standard</strong> or the <strong>Suitability Standard</strong>?</p>\n<p>If you don’t know the answer without peeking – or calling your Lifeline – you’re not alone. A surprising number of people don’t know what these very important terms mean and whether their advisor is acting in their best interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Aren’t all financial advisors required to act in their client’s best interest?</strong></p>\n<p>Surprisingly, not all financial advisors are.</p>\n<p>Broker-dealers, insurance salesman, and bank and financial company representatives, for instance, are only required to follow a <strong>Suitability Standard. </strong>That means they must provide recommendations that are “suitable” for a client – based on age for instance, or aversion to risk – but that may or may not be in that client’s best interest.</p>\n<p>Having a waiter recommend an expensive chocolate cake that is “suitable” for adults and for someone who is willing to risk trying chocolate with sea salt may not be that critical, in spite of the fact that having fresh strawberries may clearly be in your best interest. But having a financial advisor who is making recommendations primarily based on your age and risk tolerance – and who could be putting their own, or their company’s, financial interests ahead of your interests &#8212; could be disastrous for your financial future.</p>\n<p>Instead, the <strong>Fiduciary Standard</strong>, which is the standard for registered investment advisors under state and federal regulations, requires that <span style=\"color: #000066;\">a </span>financial advisor act <strong>solely</strong> in a client’s best interest when offering financial advice.</p>\n<p><strong>Registered Investment Advisors</strong> &#8211; like Sherman Wealth Management &#8211; must follow &#8211; and are held to &#8211; the <strong>Fiduciary Standard.</strong> That means that a RIA must put their client’s needs ahead of their own, provide fully-disclosed, conflict-free advice, be fully transparent about fees, and continue to monitor a client’s investments, as well as their changing financial situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s a potential scenario that illustrates the differences</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say your broker-dealer has three possible funds to recommend to you. The first is a “suitable” index fund, offered by her own company, which pays her a 6% commission on the sale and charges a 2% annual fee. The second is a similarly suitable index fund that would pay her a 3% commission on the sale and has a 1% annual fee. The third is an index fund that has no sales commission and an annual fee of .5%. Under the Suitability Standard, she can recommend the higher priced fund and still satisfy the standard. Under the Fiduciary Standard, she would be required to recommend the third fund.</p>\n<p>This is not to suggest that broker-dealers or others operating under the Suitability Standard don’t look out for their clients.  While many reps who follow the Suitability Standard give their clients excellent advice, they operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest.</p>\n<p>So go ahead and let the waiter talk you into that chocolate cake (even though you know you’ll feel better tomorrow if you have the strawberries.)

Not necessarily: the oldest lesson on Wall Street is that everything is easy in hindsight.</p>\n<p>While highly speculative, those numbers do highlight the ongoing debate over which is a better investment – real estate instruments or stocks. Both stocks have and the real estate market have had great runs in recent history and, depending on when you invested, you could make cases for both investments being the better choice.</p>\n<p>But the stock market and the real estate market both experience volatility, dips, and extended recovery times so, for the average investor, a portfolio composed of mainly real estate or other fixed assets (like art or collectibles, for instance) poses some risks that should be hedged with proper cash flow planning, a diversified portfolio, and proper tax planning.</p>\n<p><strong>Cash Flow Planning</strong></p>\n<p>A good financial plan takes into account how much cash you need access to, or may need access to in the future. Cash flow planning should be a key factor in deciding whether real estate investments are part your individualized financial strategy.</p>\n<p>As National Journal points out, Trump claims he is willing to spend upwards of $1 billion of his own money to fund his presidential campaign, yet his financial disclosure statements show that he may have less than $200 million in cash, stocks, and bonds. The rest of his fortune is tied up in real estate investments, which could be much harder to liquidate and use for his campaign.</p>\n<p>Most of us aren’t running for president but, if something like the 2007 housing collapse were to happen again, any investor who is predominantly invested in real estate could have problems liquidating those – diminished &#8211; assets for retirement, college funding, or other non-presidential goals.</p>\n<p>A solution: diversification.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversification</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you are investing in real estate or the stock market, diversification is always a prudent way to address your own risk tolerance and use proper foresight in creating a winning strategy.</p>\n<p>While with real estate funds, diversification can be achieved via many factors, including residential vs commercial investments, differing location focuses, and differing interest rates and financing mechanisms, it is still fundamentally one sector, subject to sentiment and swings.</p>\n<p>With the stock market, on the other hand, diversification allows you the opportunity to invest not only in different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and money market funds, but in a variety of sectors and industries as well. Over the past 60 years, historically, the stock market has averaged an <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp#sthash.TXk7awA7.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8% annual return</a>, so investors with strategically balanced and diversified portfolios, there is the opportunity for steady, while not spectacular gains, with the potential for less risk than investing only in the real estate market.</p>\n<p>An investor who is properly diversified through multiple asset classes – including real estate if it makes sense for their own customized strategy – is potentially better protected against the short term results of one asset class experiencing a crash or a prolonged dip.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is that options for investing in real estate in IRAs and other tax-deferred accounts are complicated and not every custodian will allow you to include real estate investments in a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/self-directed-real-estate-iras.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax-deferred account</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hindsight vs Foresight</strong></p>\n<p>While Donald Trump is an outlier because his high net worth shelters him from some of the issues with primarily being invested in real estate, it’s intriguing to consider “what if.”</p>\n<p>In the case of a more typical investor, a little foresight can go a long way in making sure you are on your way to achieving your own financial goals. A sound financial plan should be tailored to individual goals and cash flow needs, with a customized cash flow plan, and diversified across multiple asset classes for the potential for steady and compounded growth over time.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a Donald Trump with a large inheritance or a young professional just getting started, a solid plan and strategy puts the benefit of hindsight where it belongs: in a conversation over coffee or cocktails, and not as the basis for a winning investment strategy.</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/da113/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/3f132/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/8850c/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/da113/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/7223d/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/f2cbb/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/98a0736d9e891d7e5048f0b07fd606e9/e9634/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks4-1.jpg 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"2df769dc-c469-5f76-b844-fd9b2d28337c","slug":"ryans-open-letter-to-cnbc","title":"My Response To a Millennial&#8217;s Open Letter To CNBC","content":"<p>After the markets took an incredibly volatile ride on August 24th, zerohedge.com published <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-24/one-millennials-letter-cnbc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this letter</a> to CNBC from a millennial named Ryan, who wrote:</p>\n<p><em>“I&#8217;ve dipped my toes in the stock market this past year but after today&#8217;s action, I have to say I&#8217;m done. Forever. Gone. Don&#8217;t count on another dime of mine in the market.”</em></p>\n<p>Ryan isn’t alone. A surprising 74% of Millennials surveyed said they do not own stocks. And that’s unfortunate for Ryan and his fellow GenY-ers.</p>\n<p>Ryan’s letter is worth a read &#8211; and he’s makes a couple of good points &#8211; but he’s also misses a very important point: none of this should really matter to a Millennial.</p>\n<p>Here’s why.</p>\n<p><em>“I&#8217;m sure countless little guys had their stocks absolutely steamrolled this morning only to see the big guys scoop up the shares on a discount.”  </em></p>\n<p>There is obviously a <strong>wide range of ways to experience the market:</strong> as a small investor, as a large investor, and as a robot.  Are other people going to do better than you sometimes? Sure. They’re also going to do better than you at sudoko, finding parking spaces, and – unfortunately in my case – <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/3-winning-strategies-investing-and-fantasy-football-share/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fantasy Football</a> as well. But that shouldn’t matter to you, and shouldn’t keep you from investing in your own financial independence.</p>\n<p>The stock market is volatile and, sure, some investors may make impressive bets while others experience much too impressive losses (all investing involves risk, including the risk of the loss of principal.) But, historically, the S&amp;P 500 averaged a <span class=\"__postbox-detected-content __postbox-detected-date\"><span class=\"__postbox-detected-content __postbox-detected-date\">7-8%</span></span> return (after inflation)* each year and that’s value you’re missing out on if you’re not invested.</p>\n<p><em> “The only &#8220;people&#8221; who can react to those pricing distortions in real time are computers. This isn&#8217;t a place for small time people like me.” </em></p>\n<p><strong>Nothing beats human guidance</strong> and judgment to prevent panic selling or override a previous decision when a drop in a price is anomalous and not due to a fundamental loss in value. Having a plan and sticking to it is usually the best approach and there are great Financial Advisors ready to help you or sharing their insight on the web.</p>\n<p><em>“The only reasonable thing that any little guy can do is sit back and say, &#8220;Wow there is a lot of distortion going on and I can&#8217;t even guess at these prices.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Investing shouldn’t be guesswork</strong> and doesn’t have to be. A good financial advisor – or your own research – can help you select a diversified group of financial instruments tailored to your own financial goals and risk tolerance.

And this season, as in previous ones, fans will be wondering why some fantasy team managers just seem to have a knack for finding those sleepers and high upside players, while other managers routinely fail to understand and predict player value.</p>\n<p>Investors often wonder the same thing: why do some investors consistently get it right and prosper, while others are lucky if they even break even?</p>\n<p>Coincidence? Maybe, but there are several important things successful fantasy football managers have in common with successful real-life investors.</p>\n<p>Here are three important mindsets that can help you go the whole 9 yards, whether it’s on the virtual gridiron or with your own financial plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Research the Players</strong></p>\n<p>A good fantasy football manager knows that you need to study all the different variables &#8211; including roster positions, draft picks, and expected performance – to build a winning team. Understanding the available options is critical to determining things like how many players you need at each position and which players you think will be the best.</p>\n<p>This same principal applies to investing. A smart investor or financial advisor starts by understanding all the different variables, such as capital, types of investments, and asset classes. Understanding the pros and cons of various investment strategies is critical in determining how to choose a strategy that is the appropriate option for your own goals and needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Never count on a couple of stars to carry the team</strong></p>\n<p>When drafting your fantasy team, you always want to diversify your risk. You might not want to draft multiple offense players from the Green Bay Packers, for instance, even if that team is loaded with talent, because, if Aaron Rodgers and company have a bad week, your fantasy team will be struggling too. Smart fantasy managers build a stable foundation and don’t just count on rising stars.</p>\n<p>When building your investment portfolio, risk diversification is critical as well. Wall Street is littered with stories of investors who put all their eggs in one “sure” basket, only to learn the lesson of diversification the hard way. Even if you’re extremely confident that a certain sector is a good bet, it’s usually better to diversify and limit your amount of exposure to individual sectors. That way, even if the sector doesn’t do as well as you had anticipated, your investments are distributed across other asset classes, and your risk should be better managed.</p>\n<p><strong>When the going gets tough, the tough stay disciplined</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who has played fantasy football knows the danger of making a snap waiver wire decision you’ll regret later. On one hand, you don’t want to panic and drop your star player after a rough few weeks, only to see him rebound to a MVP-caliber season (and on someone else’s team!) On the other hand, just because an unproven player has a great week doesn’t mean he’s more valuable than the player you’d have to drop in order to acquire him.</p>\n<p>When the market hits a volatile patch, it takes a disciplined investor to trust their plan and avoid making snap decisions about buying and selling. A look at the history of the stock market makes it abundantly clear that investors who take a long term view do better than those who shift their investment strategies with every changing wind. This doesn’t mean that any plan should be viewed as foolproof; a good investor or financial advisor knows the value of reassessing and recalibrating appropriately and strategically. What it does mean is that, when the going gets tough, a prudent investor takes the long view, stays disciplined, and sticks to a strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s a long season</strong></p>\n<p>The only NFL team in history to have an undefeated season is the Miami Dolphins who finished 17-0 in the shorter 1972 season. No NFL team has gone 19-0 to date so it’s highly unlikely that any fantasy team will achieve perfection either. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have a great season and get smarter and smarter about putting together a winning team.</p>\n<p>With investing too, there will always be ups and downs, touchdowns and penalties, fumbles and conversions, and a few Hail Mary’s. But with a solid game plan and clearly defined goal, you’ll be on your way to a putting together a strategy designed to stand the test of time and put you squarely where you want to be: heading toward your own end zone with your eye on the ball and your own goals in sight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1304073-091715</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/da113/Football3-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/3f132/Football3-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/8850c/Football3-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/da113/Football3-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/7223d/Football3-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/f2cbb/Football3-1.jpg 800w,\n/static/a2ace260b07b3dd5618288978cd1953c/e9634/Football3-1.jpg 885w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"98bc4a93-0c90-5648-9b32-8c97610de630","slug":"volatility-compound-interest","title":"Straight Talk about Volatility and Compound Interest &#8211; the Snowball Effect","content":"<p>Compound interest is, simply put, the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment has already earned.</p>\n<p>Why is it important?

All it takes is patience to turn $1000 &#8211; the price of one ski weekend &#8211; into $21,724.52.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to start saving early.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1861\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-1024x786.jpg\" alt=\"chart25\" width=\"976\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-1024x786.jpg 1024w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-300x230.jpg 300w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1-768x589.jpg 768w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px\" /></a></p>\n<h5><em>The above chart is hypothetical and assumes an 8% rate of return compounded annually. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any specific investment.   Investment return and principal values will fluctuate so that your investment when redeemed may be worth more or less than its original cost. Rates of return do not include fees and charges, which are inherent to other investment products. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</em></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Volatility &#8211; Market Highs and Lows</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what happens if the market dips and your investment loses value?</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong> &#8211; when market value fluctuates up and down – can be an opportunity for disciplined savers who contribute regularly to their investments, regardless of share price. When prices are low, you’re able to buy more shares. When prices are high you’re able to buy fewer shares for the same amount but those shares earn more interest, which is called Dollar Cost Averaging (<em>Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.</em>)</p>\n<p>Imagine that snowball again, rolling down a hill, acquiring more and more snow as it goes. What happens when it hits a bare patch with no snow? Often it picks up rocks and pebbles, which add even more surface volume. So, when it hits the snow again, it picks up even more because it’s larger.</p>\n<p>That’s how compound interest, coupled with regular investments, may work too: the “rough patches” produce more volume, which then allows you to acquire more compounded interest. So if you buy more shares during a dip, when the market recovers you could hypothetically not only earn compound interest on more shares, you earn more interest. So long as the price of your particular investment recovers, of course.</p>\n<p>As Josh Brown points out in his recent blog post about Warren Buffett and David Tepper, both these legendary investors have gotten to where they are today because they’ve successfully ridden out volatility. In 1998 Warren Buffets own Berkshire Hathaway’s “A” shares had dropped in price from approximately $80,000 to $59,000 but Buffet didn’t sell. Those shares just hit a high of $229,000 this year.</p>\n<p>If you see volatility &#8211; like what we experienced in August &#8211; as a tool and keep contributing regularly to your investments, you’ll potentially maximize the effect of compounded interest and watch your investments snowball over time!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LFS-1174145-041515</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>******</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additional Reading:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HopNTVEJvn\"><p><a href=\"https://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/13/how-two-of-historys-greatest-investors-deal-with-losses/\">How two of history&#8217;s greatest investors deal with losses</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;How two of history&#8217;s greatest investors deal with losses&#8221; &#8212; The Reformed Broker\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://thereformedbroker.com/2015/08/13/how-two-of-historys-greatest-investors-deal-with-losses/embed/#?secret=HopNTVEJvn\" data-secret=\"HopNTVEJvn\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>http://awealthofcommonsense.com/did-investors-just-experience-the-best-risk-adjusted-returns-ever/</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator\">http://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator</a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5151515151515151,"src":"/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/da113/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/3f132/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 100w,\n/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/8850c/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/da113/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/7223d/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 600w,\n/static/4e01a77d1f3560d3bfeee74e9d651480/82ce4/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-1.jpg 752w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"2894ecdf-b9ed-59f5-9150-779c69464dc5","slug":"millennials-time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-stock-market","title":"Millennials – Time to Wake Up and Smell the Stock Market","content":"<p>On Monday, as things were heating up a bit, Cullen Roche <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cullenroche/status/635820302937796608\">tweeted</a> “The stock market is the only market where things go on sale and all the customers run out of the store&#8230;”</p>\n<p>The problem is, many Millennials weren’t even <u>in</u> the store.</p>\n<p>Only 26 percent of people under age 30 own stocks, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/more-millennials-say-no-to-stocks-and-advisors-adapt.html\">CNBC story </a>that same day. That means that, while not panicking, most Millennials may have been missing one of the biggest potential opportunities of the past 10 years.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Aren’t Millennials Investing?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are many theories –from Millennials being shell-shocked by experiencing their families’ anxiety in 2008, to YOLO, the feeling that it’s better to spend and enjoy the money now because who knows what the future may bring. The problem is that the future is likely to bring a whole lot fewer opportunities if you haven’t planned properly!</p>\n<h3><strong>Are You Even Beating Inflation? </strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s say hypothetically that the stock market may rebound by 5%&#8230; Simple, common sense math shows that keeping your money in the bank at .05% interest means it would take you 100 years to make the same amount of money that investing it now could. And the cash you are saving under the mattress or in one of your vintage vinyl sleeves? That money is just losing value every second you leave it there, as the cost of blankets and concert tickets continues to climb with inflation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Risk, Volatility, and Paper Losses</strong></h3>\n<p>It’s important to know the difference between risk and volatility and many people get it wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong> – stock prices moving up and down – is a normal part of the stock market <u>and</u> an opportunity for a disciplined saver to buy when the market is both up and down. When you have a solid plan in place you can capitalize on market price dislocations, like what happened this week. <strong>Risk</strong> is how likely you are to lose it all and it’s important to remember – while everyone has their own risk tolerance – price corrections and market volatility does not necessarily mean you are going to lose it all. As the chart below borrowed from The Irrelevant Investor’s <a href=\"https://theirrelevantinvestor.wordpress.com/2015/08/24/should-investors-stay-the-course/#more-1843\">excellent post</a> on staying the course shows, the stock market has historically climbed in spite of dips. And <strong>paper losses</strong> are just that: it’s not real loss if you don’t sell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1819\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png\" alt=\"stock market drops\" width=\"640\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1.png 640w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm-1-300x203.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As this chart by Deutsche Bank’s <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.in/There-are-2-big-problems-with-blaming-China-for-the-stock-market-sell-off/articleshow/48670991.cms\">Torsten Slok</a> shows, in spite of other times of great volatility, markets have always recovered.

The big companies aren’t interested in smaller investors with less than <a href=\"http://www.wealthprofessional.ca/news/mega-firm-cuts-small-accounts-194854.aspx\">250-500K</a> and the robo solutions don’t understand what makes each smaller investor’s situation unique. There’s a whole new breed of financial advisors, however, who combine personalized service with targeted tech solutions for smaller investors. So no excuses &#8211; there are financial pros ready help you create an investment strategy that makes sense for your personal goals and financial situation. And volatility doesn’t disrupt what we do!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’ve got a solid financial plan, investing in the stock market does not affect your ability to pay your rent, take care of yourself or your family, or add to that rainy day emergency fund. The money you’re saving and investing is money that you’ve determined <em>you don’t need now</em>, it’s money you have set aside for the long haul. Assuming your planner has planned correctly, you’re not going to miss your car payment because the Chinese stock market is crashing.</p>\n<p>And that huge correction that scared you in 2008? It eventually rebounded and the market continued to climb. As a Millennial you’ve got years on your side if you start investing now. And you’re losing the potential for growth and compounded interest every moment you wait.</p>\n<p>Baron Rothschild, of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying &#8220;The time to buy is when there&#8217;s blood in the streets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Look around.

From scouring the finance blogs and Twitter for the latest “surefire” ways to beat the market, to diagnosing our aches on WebMD, to grilling along with Bobby Flay on YouTube, it can seem like we have almost instant access to the same information as the pros.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to personal finances, why is it necessary to have a financial advisor when financial news is so readily available, Twitter is flooded with “hot tips,” robo advisors are ready to automate the whole process for you, and comparison shopping is so easy? Why can’t you just use this treasure trove of information to make your own financial decisions? Or subscribe to an algorithm-based service that will make the best lightning-quick decisions for you?</p>\n<p>A couple of reasons&#8230;</p>\n<p>If you’re good and you dedicate a lot of time online, you can definitely pick up some great information and strategies that the experts are sharing (follow me on Twitter by clicking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shermanwealth\">here</a>!) The tricky part is making sure that the information and the strategies are actually appropriate for you and appropriate right now. We all know that, if we’re not careful, the instantaneous nature of the internet, social media, and impersonal algorithms can lead to impulsive decisions that may not support our own long-term goals and personal risk profile. Quick reactions to new stock market “darlings” or to sudden market volatility can lead to choices that are not the best for your long &#8211; or even near – term financial health and growth. In fact, there is a whole science called Behavioral Finance that addresses how personal biases can lead investors to make decisions that actually work against the goals they set for themselves.</p>\n<p>A good financial professional is able to sift through the vast amount of information available to you and determine what is significant to your strategy and what may just be a distraction. A financial advisor who understands Behavioral Finance can help you see where your assumptions, habits, and biases about money and investing may be leading you to get in your own way.</p>\n<p>The new algorithm-based platforms are increasingly interesting and have a lot of merit, but the level of personalization is not yet very deep. That means that portfolios are based on broad criteria that may have nothing to do with your current situation, lifestyle, and goals. Again, this is where a trained professional will be able to view your unique individual needs and create a tailored strategy that is geared to you and not just everyone who matches your age and salary level. As more and more fiduciary financial advisors are starting to use smart algorithms as part of their offerings where appropriate, the key is “where appropriate” and “in the clients’ best interest,” the very definition of a fiduciary.</p>\n<p>Think about it: would you rather grill along with Bobby Flay on your iPad or would you rather have regular meetings with Bobby, where he looks at the size and model of your Weber, the size of your shrimp, and the recipes you’re trying to learn, and works with you to make sure you become the master of your own grill? (and shrimp!)</p>\n<p>The same goes for your financial future. While do-it-yourself is getting easier and easier, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s getting better and better. Look for a fiduciary financial advisor who also has access to the latest information online and is familiar with the latest algorithmic innovations, but who uses that information to get to know clients individually, and tailors a long-term growth strategy for them that will put them on the road to achieving the goals they have set for themselves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\n<p>With over a decade’s worth of experience in financial services, Brad Sherman is committed to helping his clients pursue their financial goals.

The result: many investors buy <a href=\"http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/are-we-buying-high-all-over-again/?scp=1&amp;sq=buy%20low%20stocks&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=1#sthash.kSv3JRiw.dpuf\">at market tops</a> and sell at market bottoms.</p>\n<p>While none of us are immune to behavioral biases, there are several things we can do to help avoid costly mistakes.</p>\n<h3><strong> 1.  Learn From the Past</strong></h3>\n<p>The first step is to understand that market declines are a normal part of investing and resist the urge to panic!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1472\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1472\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://theirrelevantinvestor.tumblr.com/post/113520921728/where-do-stocks-go-from-here-after-six-years-of\"><img class=\"wp-image-1472 size-full\" src=\"https://developmentswm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1.jpg\" alt=\"tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540\" width=\"540\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1.jpg 540w, https://wp.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_nl5tghev2m1tvtougo2_540-1-300x160.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CRSP 1-10 Index</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While the S&amp;P has historically returned almost 10% annually since the 1960s, those returns are not consistent. One year the market could be up 20% and the next it could decline 12%! To make the ride even bumpier: the market also has streaks where returns decline for several consecutive years. That’s when investors often begin to panic and pull their money out. Unfortunately, that’s usually the worst time to do so, and when investors often should be increasing their investments instead.</p>\n<p>Although the market can move up and down in the course of a year, or several years, it has historically trended upwards over longer periods of time (10 or 20 years.) So if your investment horizon is longer than just a few years, remember that it’s likely the market will <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\">recover its losses</a> &#8211; and then some &#8211; over time.</p>\n<p>Understanding that the U.S. stock market bounces back after its declines is a helpful first step in creating “un-biased” financial habits!</p>\n<h3>2.  <strong>Understand that Accepting Lower Returns May be Okay </strong></h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, younger investors have more years ahead of them to invest. That means they are often able to put a higher percentage of their money in stocks and a very low, or even zero, percentage in bonds. How much you allocate to stocks will depend on factors such as your own investment objectives and your ability to tolerate risk.</p>\n<p>If you know that you’re prone to panicking during market declines, however, you may want to keep your portfolio in more conservative investments than your age and investment horizon would normally indicate.</p>\n<p>It’s much better to be a bit more conservative and hold on to your investments during market downturns, than to buy riskier assets and sell during market crashes!</p>\n<h3><strong> 3.  Speak with a Professional</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’re like most Americans, chances are you spend more time researching your next car than researching your investments!</p>\n<p>Investing can be a difficult &#8211; and sometimes dry &#8211; subject. Learning about the history of the stock market, your own risk tolerance, and behavioral biases that can trip you up is challenging for most people and probably something you don’t want to spend a lot of time on.</p>\n<p>That’s where a trusted financial planner can help.</p>\n<p>A good financial planner can help guide you along the path in planning for your own financial goals; explain difficult concepts; help you discover your own risk tolerance; recommend appropriate investments based on those risk tolerances; and help you avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people’s portfolios.</p>\n<p>A good financial planner also understands the history of the market and knows that, while bull markets don’t last forever, declines are generally temporary as well. Knowing that, and having a plan tailored to your specific financial goals will help you to avoid panicking when markets go south, and avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people’s portfolios.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brad Sherman is a financial advisor based in Gaithersburg Maryland who is experienced in understanding both the history of the market, as well as how behavioral biases affect investor returns.

These three simple steps will give your increased focus and will help you move closer to that goal.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve incorporated them in your daily routine, identify a second goal and follow the same plan. The key to success is taking it one step at a time!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy Use Downtime Wisely </strong></h3>\n<p>At the end of your workday, do you like to relax with Netflix, video games, or YouTube? According to Corley’s data, <strong>66%</strong> of the wealthy said that they watch less than an hour of television a day, <strong>63%</strong> spend less than an hour a day on the Internet unless it is job-related, an impressive <strong>79%</strong> say they read career and educational material each day, and an equally impressive <strong>63%</strong> said &#8220;I listen to audio books during the commute to work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While we all like to relax and recharge with entertaining media, that time can never be recovered for things that help you become a stronger, more successful individual like reading, networking, exercising, or volunteering for a cause you believe in.</p>\n<p>Time is the great equalizer: we all have 24 hours a day. What you choose to do with that time can either help you to reach your financial and life goals, or distract you from it, so choose wisely!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy Invest in Their Future </strong></h3>\n<p>Corley’s research also showed that <a href=\"http://www.success.com/article/16-rich-habits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the wealthy live within their means</a>, pay themselves first, and don’t overspend.</p>\n<p>Building wealth is not accomplished by upgrading to each new electronic gadget, leasing the newest model car, and living in an extravagant home. The wealthy, according to Corley, spend less than they earn, own and maintain their cars for many years, and save a significant portion of their income. While saving money and living modestly is not as sexy as a flashy smartphone, it will go a lot further toward providing a comfortable future.</p>\n<p>Living within your means also includes not carrying credit card balances or heavy debt. When you are carrying debt, what you earn today is paying for yesterday’s expenses. Living within your means while saving and investing a portion of your income lets you invest in tomorrow, rather than yesterday, while learning to be satisfied with what you have today.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Wealthy are Willing to Take Risks </strong></h3>\n<p>Another fascinating finding of Corley’s research is that<strong> 63%</strong> of the wealthy people he interviewed said they that they had <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ways-rich-people-think-differently-2014-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taken risks</a> in search of wealth, while only 6% of the struggling Americans he interviewed said that they had taken risks.</p>\n<p>For many, fear of failure is a great de-motivator and can be paralyzing. When you do not fully understand something, whether it’s a challenge, a potential project, an investment, or even a social problem, it can be easier to do nothing than to act. But without risk, there is often no reward.</p>\n<p>What Corley discovered is that, instead, rather than fearing failure, the wealthy consider failure to be part of the process and – most importantly &#8211; an opportunity to learn.</p>\n<p>How can you face risk without fear so that you can seize potential opportunities? Educating yourself is the key step. Researching the investment, the project, or the choice, and learning about the options and risks, help keep fear and anxiety about the unknown from clouding your decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Even with the best preparation though, choices don’t turn out as envisioned. When that happens, take a page from the wealthy: learning from those failures and experiences will lead to more opportunities and better choices down the road!</p>\n<h3><strong>Are Your Own Habits Setting You Up for Success?</strong></h3>\n<p>While following each of these habits may not make you rich, they will certainly help you get into a success mind-set. <strong>68%</strong> of the Americans on Forbes billionaire list consider themselves to be “<a href=\"http://www.business-management-degree.net/features/wealthiest-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-made billionaires</a>,” which means that they worked hard to reach their own professional and financial goals. The true route to financial success is through discipline and steady habits that grow your net worth over time.</p>\n<p>Do you already share these four habits of the wealthy? If so, congratulations on your focus and your commitment to success. If not, try adopting one &#8211; or all four &#8211; of these important habits and see if it doesn’t get you closer to achieving your own goals!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With over a decade’s worth of experience in financial services, Brad Sherman is committed to helping his clients pursue their financial goals.

Here Are 4 Simple Steps To Get You Started","content":"<p>Close your eyes for a moment and envision where you’d like to be in 30 or 40 years… Are you sailing to Tahiti? Writing that book? Running your vineyard? Building a new company?</p>\n<p>If you had trouble envisioning where you’d like to be, you’re not alone. But unless you can visualize it, unless you’ve got your destination planned, it can be hard to get there. That’s why it’s so important to start thinking about what your goals currently are &#8211; whether it’s for yourself, your career, your startup, your art, and/or your family &#8211; and take the first – or the next – steps to invest in your future.</p>\n<p>What does investing mean? Very simply, it means putting your money somewhere you expect it to grow. It can be traditional stocks, bonds and mutual funds, or real estate, collectibles, annuities, and other things that are expected to gain value over time.</p>\n<p>When you’re just starting out, thinking about &#8211; and setting aside money for &#8211; your future can feel like a challenge; when you&#8217;ve just set up your first lemonade stand and barely breaking even, it’s hard to think about re-investing part of your profits in lemon groves that will someday produce income for you.</p>\n<p>The trick is to overcome inertia, get started, and make a commitment, even if it’s just a tiny first step.</p>\n<h3><strong>Inertia is not your friend</strong></h3>\n<p>Inertia is one of the biggest reasons people waste opportunities to started investing when they’re young.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Objects at rest tend to stay at rest:</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not investing yet, or if your money is sitting in a non-income producing bank account it can be hard to get started or get moving.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Objects in motion tend to stay in motion:</em></strong></p>\n<p>If your money is constantly in motion, if you’re spending everything you make, or if your money is following the crowd to the next big glamour stock, it can be hard to slow down and take stock with a Financial Planner to build a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>A study by Hewitt Associates found, for instance, that only 31% of employees in their 20s invest in their company’s 401K plan¹. That means almost 70% of young employees who could be investing in a matching 401k plan haven’t started taking advantage of what is essentially free money. Whether inertia is keeping them from getting started, or inertia is keeping their money in motion so that there’s none left over to invest, they are not only leaving free money on the table, they’re not letting that money grow through compounding.</p>\n<p>According to an article in US News and World Report, if you start investing just $100 a month in your 20s, increase contributions as your income increases, and make good financial decisions along the way, you are on your way to potentially retiring with over 1 million dollars.²</p>\n<h3><strong>How Do You Get Started?</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are four simple steps to get you past inertia and get you started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find your motivation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are all passionate about certain things. The more you care, the more focused you are about achieving your goals. Make a list of the things that are important to you and the things you want to achieve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find extra money</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are only two ways to “find” money &#8211; spending less or making more. While it may seem daunting – inertia again! – you’d be surprised by how easy it is to discover places you can cut back a little or spend a little less. And, while you have a lot more control over your spending than your earnings, you can also look for ways to find extra sources of income, work more hours, or even get a better paying job.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Move financial goals up</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you plan to save “whatever you have left” or “whatever you’ve saved” at the end of each month, don’t be surprised by how little that actually is. We all have a tendency to spend what we have, and spend more as our income goes up. You can avoid that pitfall by paying yourself first. When you prioritize saving in your budget and take that money “out of circulation,” your spending will fall in line.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get advice from an adviser you trust</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The world of finance and investing can be complicated and confusing. Don’t let fear of the unknown keep you from getting started. You don’t need a large amount of savings to meet with an adviser who can answer a lot of your questions. Getting a roadmap from someone who knows the territory will help you get started and may allow for a smoother journey.</p>\n<p>Investing in your future is an investment in yourself. If you take these four simple steps, even with limited assets, you’ll be laying the foundation for a lifetime of investing in your own plans and goals, and your own vision of financial freedom.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>All investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that any investing strategy will be successful.
