We want you to get good-quality financial advice at a price that makes sense. That’s why we don’t require the investment minimums or routine maintenance fees common to other firms. As a fee-only registered investment advisory firm (RIA), we <em>don’t</em> receive commissions. Instead, we charge solely by a percentage of the assets we manage for you. And, to further minimize fees, we incorporate low-cost [ETFs] and [Dimensional Fund Advisors strategies] into our process.</p>\n<p>Everything we do at Sherman Wealth Management is customized for you. That means that your investment portfolio isn’t managed by an algorithm or by a demographic formula. We prioritize your individual needs, goals and risk tolerance. And as fiduciaries, we are legally bound to place your interests ahead of our own. That means you can be confident that our advice really is conflict-free and fully focused on <em>you</em>.</p>\n","id":"8e967271-d4f0-553a-98c5-796cae41a5101content_blocksWordPressAcf_regular_content"}]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"our-services","template":"page-flexiblecontent.php"}}}
