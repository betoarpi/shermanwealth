When will you stop working?  Where will you live? And perhaps most importantly HOW will you  live?. Once your earning years are over, you&#8217;ll need enough income or other assets  to support your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Similar to overall <strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/financial-planning-maryland/\">Financial Planning</a></strong>, <strong>Retirement Planning</strong> can be thought of as a road map, guiding you towards your destination of a secure retirement. There may be stops and detours as the years go by, and some may require adjustments to your plan. But as long as you have a plan in place and follow it, your goals can be reached.</p>\n<p>Whether retirement is many years off, or just around the corner, we want to help you to arrive at your financial destination, by realizing your goal of a secure retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is Retirement Planning Important?</strong><strong><br />\n</strong>A study by Fidelity Investments found that 57 percent of retirees wish they had done more <strong>retirement planning</strong> before leaving the workplace. Relying on Social Security  to provide anything more than the bare minimum of financial assistance isn&#8217;t realistic. And the sad reality is, by the time you reach retirement age, Social Security benefits may be a thing of the past. Even private pension plans and defined benefit plans offered by employers are subject to  failure. There are no guarantees. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important that you have a plan in place now that YOU control. Get in the habit of not only saving for your future, but becoming involved in your investment choices. Doing nothing to plan for retirement is not an option, and <strong>early retirement planning</strong> is more important than ever,  A secure future may depend on the choices you make today. And while  it&#8217;s never too early to plan for retirement, it&#8217;s also never too late.</p>\n<p><strong>How does Sherman Wealth provide <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Retirement Planning Services</span>?</strong><strong><br />\n</strong>Wise investing involves the proper evaluation  and selection of  available options while taking into account individual objectives and tolerance for risk. <strong>Retirement today</strong> means different things to different people, and by learning about your individual needs and current situation,  we&#8217;ll provide you with  <strong>retirement planning options</strong> that will offer you improved confidence &#8211; by developing a <strong><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/customized-financial-portfolio-construction/\">custom financial portfolio</a> </strong>tailored to your specific goals and risk tolerance.
